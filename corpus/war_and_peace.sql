But I warn you, if you don\'t tell me that this means war,\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by\nthat Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have\nnothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer\nmy \'faithful slave,\' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see\nI have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna\nPavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya\nFedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man\nof high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her\nreception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as\nshe said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in\nSt. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and\ndelivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too\nterrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and\n10--Annette Scherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the\nleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing\nan embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had\nstars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke\nin that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but\nthought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a\nman of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went\nup to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,\nscented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the\nsofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\'s\nmind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the\npoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even\nirony could be discerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times\nlike these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are\nstaying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador\'s? Today is Wednesday. I\nmust put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is\ncoming for me to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today\'s fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would\nhave been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by\nforce of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don\'t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev\'s\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold,\nlistless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that\nBuonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to\nburn ours.\"\n\nPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a\nstale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty\nyears, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an\nenthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she\ndid not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to\ndisappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile\nwhich, though it did not suit her faded features, always played\nround her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual\nconsciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor\ncould, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna\nburst out:\n\n\"Oh, don\'t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\'t understand\nthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.\nShe is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious\nsovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is\nthe one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to\nperform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble\nthat God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and\ncrush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than\never in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must\navenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely\non?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot\nunderstand the Emperor Alexander\'s loftiness of soul. She has\nrefused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some\nsecret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.\nThe English have not understood and cannot understand the\nself-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only\ndesires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And\nwhat little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has\nalways declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe\nis powerless before him.... And I don\'t believe a word that Hardenburg\nsays, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a\ntrap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored\nmonarch. He will save Europe!\"\n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\n\"I think,\" said the prince with a smile, \"that if you had been\nsent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the\nKing of Prussia\'s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you\ngive me a cup of tea?\"\n\n\"In a moment. A propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I am\nexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,\nwho is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of\nthe best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good\nones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He\nhas been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\"\nhe added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred\nto him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive\nof his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke\nto be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts\nis a poor creature.\"\n\nPrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others\nwere trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it\nfor the baron.\n\nAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she\nnor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or\nwas pleased with.\n\n\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\nsister,\" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna\'s face suddenly assumed an\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron\nFunke beaucoup d\'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the\nwomanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna\nPavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of\na man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,\nso she said:\n\n\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\nout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\nbeautiful.\"\n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\n\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\nto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that\npolitical and social topics were ended and the time had come for\nintimate conversation--\"I often think how unfairly sometimes the\njoys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid\nchildren? I don\'t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don\'t like\nhim,\" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her\neyebrows. \"Two such charming children. And really you appreciate\nthem less than anyone, and so you don\'t deserve to have them.\"\n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\n\"I can\'t help it,\" said the prince. \"Lavater would have said I\nlack the bump of paternity.\"\n\n\"Don\'t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I\nam dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\" (and her\nface assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at Her\nMajesty\'s and you were pitied....\"\n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did all\na father could for their education, and they have both turned out\nfools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active\none. That is the only difference between them.\" He said this smiling\nin a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles\nround his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse\nand unpleasant.\n\n\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\nfather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\" said Anna\nPavlovna, looking up pensively.\n\n\"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\nchildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\nis how I explain it to myself. It can\'t be helped!\"\n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\ngesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.\n\n\"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\"\nshe asked. \"They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and\nthough I don\'t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little\nperson who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of\nyours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya.\"\n\nPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory\nand perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a\nmovement of the head that he was considering this information.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\ncurrent of his thoughts, \"that Anatole is costing me forty thousand\nrubles a year? And,\" he went on after a pause, \"what will it be in\nfive years, if he goes on like this?\" Presently he added: \"That\'s what\nwe fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?\"\n\n\"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He\nis the well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army\nunder the late Emperor, and was nicknamed \'the King of Prussia.\' He is\nvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very\nunhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise\nMeinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov\'s and will be here\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Listen, dear Annette,\" said the prince, suddenly taking Anna\nPavlovna\'s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \"Arrange\nthat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe\nwith an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is\nrich and of good family and that\'s all I want.\"\n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised\nthe maid of honor\'s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and\nfro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n\n\"Attendez,\" said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, \"I\'ll speak to Lise,\nyoung Bolkonski\'s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can\nbe arranged. It shall be on your family\'s behalf that I\'ll start my\napprenticeship as old maid.\"');

The highest\nPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age\nand character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.\nPrince Vasili\'s daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her\nfather to the ambassador\'s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and\nher badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess\nBolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,* was\nalso there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being\npregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small\nreceptions. Prince Vasili\'s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart,\nwhom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had also come.\n\n\n*The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\n\n\nTo each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, \"You have not yet seen my\naunt,\" or \"You do not know my aunt?\" and very gravely conducted him or\nher to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who\nhad come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to\narrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna\nPavlovna mentioned each one\'s name and then left them.\n\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom\nnot one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of\nthem cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful\nand solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of\nthem in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health\nof Her Majesty, \"who, thank God, was better today.\" And each\nvisitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left\nthe old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious\nduty and did not return to her the whole evening.\n\nThe young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a\ngold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a\ndelicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her\nteeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming\nwhen she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always\nthe case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness\nof her upper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special\nand peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of\nthis pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life\nand health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull\ndispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company\nand talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were\nbecoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her,\nand at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her\nwhite teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that\nday.\n\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short,\nswaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her\ndress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was\ndoing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. \"I have brought\nmy work,\" said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all\npresent. \"Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick\non me,\" she added, turning to her hostess. \"You wrote that it was to\nbe quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.\"\nAnd she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed,\ndainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.\n\n\"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone\nelse,\" replied Anna Pavlovna.\n\n\"You know,\" said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in\nFrench, turning to a general, \"my husband is deserting me? He is going\nto get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?\" she\nadded, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer she\nturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.\n\n\"What a delightful woman this little princess is!\" said Prince\nVasili to Anna Pavlovna.\n\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with\nclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable\nat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout\nyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known\ngrandee of Catherine\'s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man\nhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had\nonly just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this\nwas his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with\nthe nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room.\nBut in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and\nfear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the\nplace, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was\ncertainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety\ncould only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant\nand natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else\nin that drawing room.\n\n\"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor\ninvalid,\" said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her\naunt as she conducted him to her.\n\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look\nround as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to\nthe little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate\nacquaintance.\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the\naunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty\'s health.\nAnna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: \"Do you know\nthe Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very\ninteresting but hardly feasible.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and\nget away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now\ncommitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady\nbefore she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak\nto another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big\nfeet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the\nabbe\'s plan chimerical.\n\n\"We will talk of it later,\" said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.\n\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave,\nshe resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch,\nready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to\nflag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands\nto work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or\nthere one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and\nhastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna\nPavlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a\ntoo-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the\nconversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid\nthese cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an\nanxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to\nlisten to what was being said there, and again when he passed to\nanother group whose center was the abbe.\n\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna\nPavlovna\'s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all\nthe intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like\na child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of\nmissing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the\nself-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he\nwas always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he\ncame up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he\nstood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young\npeople are fond of doing.');

The spindles hummed\nsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,\nbeside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face\nwas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company\nhad settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed\nround the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the\nbeautiful Princess Helene, Prince Vasili\'s daughter, and the little\nPrincess Bolkonskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump\nfor her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna\nPavlovna.\n\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and\npolished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out\nof politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in\nwhich he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up\nas a treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d\'hotel serves up as a\nspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen\nit in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served\nup to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly\nchoice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing\nthe murder of the Duc d\'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc\nd\'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were\nparticular reasons for Buonaparte\'s hatred of him.\n\n\"Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,\" said Anna Pavlovna,\nwith a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in\nthe sound of that sentence: \"Contez nous cela, Vicomte.\"\n\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness\nto comply. Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone\nto listen to his tale.\n\n\"The vicomte knew the duc personally,\" whispered Anna Pavlovna to of\nthe guests. \"The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,\" said she to\nanother. \"How evidently he belongs to the best society,\" said she to a\nthird; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest\nand most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef\non a hot dish.\n\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\n\n\"Come over here, Helene, dear,\" said Anna Pavlovna to the\nbeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of\nanother group.\n\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with\nwhich she had first entered the room--the smile of a perfectly\nbeautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed\nwith moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and\nsparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her,\nnot looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously\nallowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and\nshapely shoulders, back, and bosom--which in the fashion of those days\nwere very much exposed--and she seemed to bring the glamour of a\nballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so\nlovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on\nthe contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too\nvictorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish\nits effect.\n\n\"How lovely!\" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted\nhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something\nextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also\nwith her unchanging smile.\n\n\"Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,\" said he,\nsmilingly inclining his head.\n\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and\nconsidered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the\nstory was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful\nround arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her\nstill more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond\nnecklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and\nwhenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at\nonce adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor\'s\nface, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.\n\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene.\n\n\"Wait a moment, I\'ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking\nof?\" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. \"Fetch me my workbag.\"\n\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking\nmerrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in\nher seat.\n\n\"Now I am all right,\" she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she\ntook up her work.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle\nand moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\n\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary\nresemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that\nin spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features\nwere like his sister\'s, but while in her case everything was lit up by\na joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation,\nand by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the\ncontrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of\nsullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes,\nnose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace,\nand his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.\n\n\"It\'s not going to be a ghost story?\" said he, sitting down beside\nthe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this\ninstrument he could not begin to speak.\n\n\"Why no, my dear fellow,\" said the astonished narrator, shrugging\nhis shoulders.\n\n\"Because I hate ghost stories,\" said Prince Hippolyte in a tone\nwhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he\nhad uttered them.\n\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be\nsure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was\ndressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of\ncuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\n\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then\ncurrent, to the effect that the Duc d\'Enghien had gone secretly to\nParis to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon\nBonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress\' favors, and that in\nhis presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits\nto which he was subject, and was thus at the duc\'s mercy. The latter\nspared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by\ndeath.\n\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point\nwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies\nlooked agitated.\n\n\"Charming!\" said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the\nlittle princess.\n\n\"Charming!\" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle\ninto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of\nthe story prevented her from going on with it.\n\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully\nprepared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a\nwatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he\nwas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to\nthe rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe\nabout the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by\nthe young man\'s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet\ntheory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally,\nwhich was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved.\n\n\"The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of\nthe people,\" the abbe was saying. \"It is only necessary for one\npowerful nation like Russia--barbaric as she is said to be--to place\nherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its\nobject the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would\nsave the world!\"\n\n\"But how are you to get that balance?\" Pierre was beginning.\n\nAt that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at\nPierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The\nItalian\'s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively\naffected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing\nwith women.\n\n\"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the\nsociety, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have\nhad the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think\nof the climate,\" said he.\n\nNot letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the more\nconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the\nlarger circle.');

He was a very handsome\nyoung man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features.\nEverything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet,\nmeasured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little\nwife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing\nroom, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look\nat or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so\ntedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.\nHe turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome\nface, kissed Anna Pavlovna\'s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned\nthe whole company.\n\n\"You are off to the war, Prince?\" said Anna Pavlovna.\n\n\"General Kutuzov,\" said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing the\nlast syllable of the general\'s name like a Frenchman, \"has been\npleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....\"\n\n\"And Lise, your wife?\"\n\n\"She will go to the country.\"\n\n\"Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\"\n\n\"Andre,\" said his wife, addressing her husband in the same\ncoquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, \"the vicomte has\nbeen telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!\"\n\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who\nfrom the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with\nglad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he\nlooked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance\nwith whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre\'s beaming\nface he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.\n\n\"There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?\" said he to\nPierre.\n\n\"I knew you would be here,\" replied Pierre. \"I will come to supper\nwith you. May I?\" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the\nvicomte who was continuing his story.\n\n\"No, impossible!\" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre\'s\nhand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished\nto say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his\ndaughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.\n\n\"You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,\" said Prince Vasili to the\nFrenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent\nhis rising. \"This unfortunate fete at the ambassador\'s deprives me\nof a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to\nleave your enchanting party,\" said he, turning to Anna Pavlovna.\n\nHis daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly\nholding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more\nradiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,\nalmost frightened, eyes as she passed him.\n\n\"Very lovely,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Very,\" said Pierre.\n\nIn passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre\'s hand and said to Anna\nPavlovna: \"Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a\nwhole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.\nNothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever\nwomen.\"\n\nAnna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew\nhis father to be a connection of Prince Vasili\'s. The elderly lady who\nhad been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook\nPrince Vasili in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had\nassumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed\nonly anxiety and fear.\n\n\"How about my son Boris, Prince?\" said she, hurrying after him\ninto the anteroom. \"I can\'t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me\nwhat news I may take back to my poor boy.\"\n\nAlthough Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to\nthe elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an\ningratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might\nnot go away.\n\n\"What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he\nwould be transferred to the Guards at once?\" said she.\n\n\"Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,\" answered\nPrince Vasili, \"but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I\nshould advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn.\nThat would be the best way.\"\n\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the\nbest families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of\nsociety had lost her former influential connections. She had now\ncome to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her\nonly son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had\nobtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna\'s reception and had sat\nlistening to the vicomte\'s story. Prince Vasili\'s words frightened\nher, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a\nmoment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasili\'s arm more\ntightly.\n\n\"Listen to me, Prince,\" said she. \"I have never yet asked you for\nanything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my\nfather\'s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God\'s sake to\ndo this for my son--and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,\"\nshe added hurriedly. \"No, don\'t be angry, but promise! I have asked\nGolitsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always\nwere,\" she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.\n\n\"Papa, we shall be late,\" said Princess Helene, turning her\nbeautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she\nstood waiting by the door.\n\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be\neconomized if it is to last. Prince Vasili knew this, and having\nonce realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him,\nhe would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using\nhis influence. But in Princess Drubetskaya\'s case he felt, after her\nsecond appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded\nhim of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the\nfirst steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners\nthat she was one of those women--mostly mothers--who, having once made\nup their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and\nare prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour\nafter hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved\nhim.\n\n\"My dear Anna Mikhaylovna,\" said he with his usual familiarity and\nweariness of tone, \"it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask;\nbut to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father\'s\nmemory, I will do the impossible--your son shall be transferred to the\nGuards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you--I knew your\nkindness!\" He turned to go.\n\n\"Wait--just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...\"\nshe faltered. \"You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich\nKutuzov... recommend Boris to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at\nrest, and then...\"\n\nPrince Vasili smiled.\n\n\"No, I won\'t promise that. You don\'t know how Kutuzov is pestered\nsince his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that\nall the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as\nadjutants.\"\n\n\"No, but do promise! I won\'t let you go! My dear benefactor...\"\n\n\"Papa,\" said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,\n\"we shall be late.\"\n\n\"Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?\"\n\n\"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?\"\n\n\"Certainly; but about Kutuzov, I don\'t promise.\"\n\n\"Do promise, do promise, Vasili!\" cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went,\nwith the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came\nnaturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\n\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit\nemployed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone\nher face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She\nreturned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again\npretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her\ntask was accomplished.');

Adorable! It is enough to make one\'s head whirl! It is\nas if the whole world had gone crazy.\"\n\nPrince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a\nsarcastic smile.\n\n\"\'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!\'* They say he was very\nfine when he said that,\" he remarked, repeating the words in\nItalian: \"\'Dio mi l\'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!\'\"\n\n\n*God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!\n\n\n\"I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run\nover,\" Anna Pavlovna continued. \"The sovereigns will not be able to\nendure this man who is a menace to everything.\"\n\n\"The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,\" said the vicomte, polite\nbut hopeless: \"The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis\nXVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!\" and he\nbecame more animated. \"And believe me, they are reaping the reward\nof their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they\nare sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.\"\n\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time\nthrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the\nlittle princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde\ncoat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much\ngravity as if she had asked him to do it.\n\n\"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d\'azur--maison Conde,\" said\nhe.\n\nThe princess listened, smiling.\n\n\"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,\" the\nvicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which\nhe is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others\nbut follows the current of his own thoughts, \"things will have gone\ntoo far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French\nsociety--I mean good French society--will have been forever destroyed,\nand then...\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to\nmake a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna,\nwho had him under observation, interrupted:\n\n\"The Emperor Alexander,\" said she, with the melancholy which\nalways accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family,\n\"has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to\nchoose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from\nthe usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the\narms of its rightful king,\" she concluded, trying to be amiable to the\nroyalist emigrant.\n\n\"That is doubtful,\" said Prince Andrew. \"Monsieur le Vicomte quite\nrightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it\nwill be difficult to return to the old regime.\"\n\n\"From what I have heard,\" said Pierre, blushing and breaking into\nthe conversation, \"almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\nBonaparte\'s side.\"\n\n\"It is the Buonapartists who say that,\" replied the vicomte\nwithout looking at Pierre. \"At the present time it is difficult to\nknow the real state of French public opinion.\"\n\n\"Bonaparte has said so,\" remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic\nsmile.\n\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his\nremarks at him, though without looking at him.\n\n\"\'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,\'\"\nPrince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting\nNapoleon\'s words. \"\'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.\' I\ndo not know how far he was justified in saying so.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" replied the vicomte. \"After the murder of the\nduc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some\npeople,\" he went on, turning to Anna Pavlovna, \"he ever was a hero,\nafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and\none hero less on earth.\"\n\nBefore Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their\nappreciation of the vicomte\'s epigram, Pierre again broke into the\nconversation, and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say\nsomething inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.\n\n\"The execution of the Duc d\'Enghien,\" declared Monsieur Pierre, \"was\na political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed\ngreatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole\nresponsibility of that deed.\"\n\n\"Dieu! Mon Dieu!\" muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper.\n\n\"What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows\ngreatness of soul?\" said the little princess, smiling and drawing\nher work nearer to her.\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" exclaimed several voices.\n\n\"Capital!\" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping\nhis knee with the palm of his hand.\n\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at\nhis audience over his spectacles and continued.\n\n\"I say so,\" he continued desperately, \"because the Bourbons fled\nfrom the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon\nalone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general\ngood, he could not stop short for the sake of one man\'s life.\"\n\n\"Won\'t you come over to the other table?\" suggested Anna Pavlovna.\n\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n\n\"No,\" cried he, becoming more and more eager, \"Napoleon is great\nbecause he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,\npreserved all that was good in it--equality of citizenship and freedom\nof speech and of the press--and only for that reason did he obtain\npower.\"\n\n\"Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to\ncommit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have\ncalled him a great man,\" remarked the vicomte.\n\n\"He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he\nmight rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a\ngreat man. The Revolution was a grand thing!\" continued Monsieur\nPierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his\nextreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.\n\n\"What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...\nBut won\'t you come to this other table?\" repeated Anna Pavlovna.\n\n\"Rousseau\'s Contrat social,\" said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.\n\n\"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.\"\n\n\"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,\" again interjected\nan ironical voice.\n\n\"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most\nimportant. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation\nfrom prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas\nNapoleon has retained in full force.\"\n\n\"Liberty and equality,\" said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at\nlast deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words\nwere, \"high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who\ndoes not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached\nliberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier?\nOn the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.\"\n\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the\nvicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment\nof Pierre\'s outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was\nhorror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre\'s sacrilegious words had\nnot exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was\nimpossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the\nvicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.\n\n\"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,\" said she, \"how do you explain the\nfact of a great man executing a duc--or even an ordinary man who--is\ninnocent and untried?\"\n\n\"I should like,\" said the vicomte, \"to ask how monsieur explains the\n18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at\nall like the conduct of a great man!\"\n\n\"And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!\" said the\nlittle princess, shrugging her shoulders.\n\n\"He\'s a low fellow, say what you will,\" remarked Prince Hippolyte.\n\nPierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.\nHis smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,\nhis grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by\nanother--a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed\nto ask forgiveness.\n\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly\nthat this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested.\nAll were silent.\n\n\"How do you expect him to answer you all at once?\" said Prince\nAndrew. \"Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish\nbetween his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.\nSo it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course!\" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of\nthis reinforcement.\n\n\"One must admit,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"that Napoleon as a man\nwas great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa\nwhere he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but... but there are\nother acts which it is difficult to justify.\"\n\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness\nof Pierre\'s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time\nto go.\n\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to\nattend, and asking them all to be seated began:\n\n\"I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to\nit. Excuse me, Vicomte--I must tell it in Russian or the point will be\nlost....\" And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian\nas a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.\nEveryone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their\nattention to his story.\n\n\"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She\nmust have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was\nher taste. And she had a lady\'s maid, also big. She said...\"\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"She said... Oh yes! She said, \'Girl,\' to the maid, \'put on a\nlivery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some\ncalls.\'\"\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long\nbefore his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the\nnarrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna\nPavlovna, did however smile.\n\n\"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat\nand her long hair came down....\" Here he could contain himself no\nlonger and went on, between gasps of laughter: \"And the whole world\nknew....\"\n\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had\ntold it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna\nand the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte\'s social tact in so\nagreeably ending Pierre\'s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the\nanecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about\nthe last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom,\nand when and where.');

Stout, about the average height, broad, with\nhuge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a\ndrawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say\nsomething particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he\nwas absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his\nown, the general\'s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the\nplume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his\nabsent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it\nwas, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression.\nAnna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that\nexpressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: \"I hope to\nsee you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my\ndear Monsieur Pierre.\"\n\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again\neverybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, \"Opinions\nare opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.\"\nAnd everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.\n\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders\nto the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened\nindifferently to his wife\'s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also\ncome into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty,\npregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.\n\n\"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,\" said the little\nprincess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. \"It is settled,\" she added in\na low voice.\n\nAnna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match\nshe contemplated between Anatole and the little princess\'\nsister-in-law.\n\n\"I rely on you, my dear,\" said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone.\n\"Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au\nrevoir!\"--and she left the hall.\n\nPrince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his\nface close to her, began to whisper something.\n\nTwo footmen, the princess\' and his own, stood holding a shawl and\na cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to\nthe French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of\nunderstanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as\nusual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.\n\n\"I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador\'s,\" said Prince\nHippolyte \"-so dull-. It has been a delightful evening, has it not?\nDelightful!\"\n\n\"They say the ball will be very good,\" replied the princess, drawing\nup her downy little lip. \"All the pretty women in society will be\nthere.\"\n\n\"Not all, for you will not be there; not all,\" said Prince Hippolyte\nsmiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he\neven pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either\nfrom awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after\nthe shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long\ntime, as though embracing her.\n\nStill smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at\nher husband. Prince Andrew\'s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did\nhe seem.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" he asked his wife, looking past her.\n\nPrince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest\nfashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out\ninto the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into\nthe carriage.\n\n\"Princesse, au revoir,\" cried he, stumbling with his tongue as\nwell as with his feet.\n\nThe princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the\ndark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince\nHippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone\'s way.\n\n\"Allow me, sir,\" said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,\ndisagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.\n\n\"I am expecting you, Pierre,\" said the same voice, but gently and\naffectionately.\n\nThe postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte\nlaughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte\nwhom he had promised to take home.\n\n\"Well, mon cher,\" said the vicomte, having seated himself beside\nHippolyte in the carriage, \"your little princess is very nice, very\nnice indeed, quite French,\" and he kissed the tips of his fingers.\nHippolyte burst out laughing.\n\n\"Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,\"\ncontinued the vicomte. \"I pity the poor husband, that little officer\nwho gives himself the airs of a monarch.\"\n\nHippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, \"And you\nwere saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One\nhas to know how to deal with them.\"\n\n\nPierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew\'s study like\none quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa,\ntook from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was\nCaesar\'s Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it\nin the middle.\n\n\"What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite ill now,\"\nsaid Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white\nhands.\n\nPierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak.

Well, have you\nat last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a\ndiplomatist?\" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.\n\nPierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.\n\n\"Really, I don\'t yet know. I don\'t like either the one or the\nother.\"\n\n\"But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.\"\n\nPierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor,\nand had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow\nhis father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man, \"Now go to\nPetersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to\nanything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, and here is money.\nWrite to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.\" Pierre\nhad already been choosing a career for three months, and had not\ndecided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was\nspeaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.\n\n\"But he must be a Freemason,\" said he, referring to the abbe whom he\nhad met that evening.\n\n\"That is all nonsense.\" Prince Andrew again interrupted him, \"let us\ntalk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?\"\n\n\"No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to\ntell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for\nfreedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the\narmy; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in\nthe world is not right.\"\n\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre\'s childish\nwords. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to\nsuch nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any\nother answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question.\n\n\"If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no\nwars,\" he said.\n\n\"And that would be splendid,\" said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically.\n\n\"Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about...\"\n\n\"Well, why are you going to the war?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"What for? I don\'t know. I must. Besides that I am going...\" He\npaused. \"I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit\nme!\"');

Prince\nAndrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it\nhad had in Anna Pavlovna\'s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet\nfrom the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a\nhouse dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose\nand politely placed a chair for her.\n\n\"How is it,\" she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly\nand fussily in the easy chair, \"how is it Annette never got married?\nHow stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for\nsaying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative\nfellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!\"\n\n\"And I am still arguing with your husband. I can\'t understand why he\nwants to go to the war,\" replied Pierre, addressing the princess\nwith none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their\nintercourse with young women.\n\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre\'s words touched her to the\nquick.\n\n\"Ah, that is just what I tell him!\" said she. \"I don\'t understand\nit; I don\'t in the least understand why men can\'t live without wars.\nHow is it that we women don\'t want anything of the kind, don\'t need\nit? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is\nUncle\'s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well\nknown, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the\nApraksins\' I heard a lady asking, \'Is that the famous Prince\nAndrew?\' I did indeed.\" She laughed. \"He is so well received\neverywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You\nknow the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were\nspeaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?\"\n\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the\nconversation, gave no reply.\n\n\"When are you starting?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, don\'t speak of his going, don\'t! I won\'t hear it spoken of,\"\nsaid the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had\nspoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly\nill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.\n\"Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must\nbe broken off... and then you know, Andre...\" (she looked\nsignificantly at her husband) \"I\'m afraid, I\'m afraid!\" she whispered,\nand a shudder ran down her back.\n\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone\nbesides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a\ntone of frigid politeness.\n\n\"What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don\'t understand,\" said he.\n\n\"There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a\nwhim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up\nalone in the country.\"\n\n\"With my father and sister, remember,\" said Prince Andrew gently.\n\n\"Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to\nbe afraid.\"\n\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a\njoyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if\nshe felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though\nthe gist of the matter lay in that.\n\n\"I still can\'t understand what you are afraid of,\" said Prince\nAndrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.\n\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.\n\n\"No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have...\"\n\n\"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\"You had better go.\"\n\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip\nquivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about\nthe room.\n\nPierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now at him\nand now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.\n\n\"Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?\" exclaimed the little\nprincess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a\ntearful grimace. \"I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you\nhave changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the\nwar and have no pity for me. Why is it?\"\n\n\"Lise!\" was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an\nentreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself\nregret her words. But she went on hurriedly:\n\n\"You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you\nbehave like that six months ago?\"\n\n\"Lise, I beg you to desist,\" said Prince Andrew still more\nemphatically.\n\nPierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened\nto all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to\nbear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.\n\n\"Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because... I assure you\nI myself have experienced... and so... because... No, excuse me! An\noutsider is out of place here... No, don\'t distress yourself...\nGood-by!\"\n\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand.\n\n\"No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of\nthe pleasure of spending the evening with you.\"\n\n\"No, he thinks only of himself,\" muttered the princess without\nrestraining her angry tears.\n\n\"Lise!\" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch\nwhich indicates that patience is exhausted.\n\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess\' pretty\nface changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful\neyes glanced askance at her husband\'s face, and her own assumed the\ntimid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags\nits drooping tail.\n\n\"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!\" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one\nhand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.\n\n\"Good night, Lise,\" said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand\nas he would have done to a stranger.');

Pierre\ncontinually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his\nforehead with his small hand.\n\n\"Let us go and have supper,\" he said with a sigh, going to the door.\n\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining\nroom. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and\nglass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the\nnewly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his\nelbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as\nPierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk--as one who\nhas long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak\nout.\n\n\"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That\'s my advice: never marry\ntill you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable\nof, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and\nhave seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and\nirrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing--or\nall that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be\nwasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don\'t look at me with such surprise.\nIf you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you\nwill feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed\nexcept the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with\na court lackey and an idiot!... But what\'s the good?...\" and he\nwaved his arm.\n\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different\nand the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at\nhis friend in amazement.\n\n\"My wife,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"is an excellent woman, one of\nthose rare women with whom a man\'s honor is safe; but, O God, what\nwould I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one\nto whom I mention this, because I like you.\"\n\nAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski\nwho had lolled in Anna Pavlovna\'s easy chairs and with half-closed\neyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his\nthin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in\nwhich the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with\nbrilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at\nordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of\nalmost morbid irritation.\n\n\"You don\'t understand why I say this,\" he continued, \"but it is\nthe whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,\" said\nhe (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), \"but Bonaparte when he\nworked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had\nnothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself\nup with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And\nall you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and\ntorments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and\ntriviality--these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I\nam now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know\nnothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic\nwit,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"and at Anna Pavlovna\'s they listen\nto me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and\nthose women... If you only knew what those society women are, and\nwomen in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial\nin everything--that\'s what women are when you see them in their true\ncolors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were\nsomething in them, but there\'s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don\'t\nmarry, my dear fellow; don\'t marry!\" concluded Prince Andrew.\n\n\"It seems funny to me,\" said Pierre, \"that you, you should\nconsider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have\neverything before you, everything. And you...\"\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he\nthought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.\n\n\"How can he talk like that?\" thought Pierre. He considered his\nfriend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the\nhighest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which\nmight be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always\nastonished at Prince Andrew\'s calm manner of treating everybody, his\nextraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything,\nknew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all\nat his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck\nby Andrew\'s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he\nhimself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a\ndefect but as a sign of strength.\n\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life,\npraise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary\nto wheels that they may run smoothly.\n\n\"My part is played out,\" said Prince Andrew. \"What\'s the use of\ntalking about me? Let us talk about you,\" he added after a silence,\nsmiling at his reassuring thoughts.\n\nThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierre\'s face.\n\n\"But what is there to say about me?\" said Pierre, his face\nrelaxing into a careless, merry smile. \"What am I? An illegitimate\nson!\" He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a\ngreat effort to say this. \"Without a name and without means... And\nit really...\" But he did not say what \"it really\" was. \"For the\npresent I am free and am all right. Only I haven\'t the least idea what\nI am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.\"\n\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance--friendly and\naffectionate as it was--expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n\n\"I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among\nour whole set. Yes, you\'re all right! Choose what you will; it\'s all\nthe same. You\'ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up\nvisiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so\nbadly--all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!\"\n\n\"What would you have, my dear fellow?\" answered Pierre, shrugging\nhis shoulders. \"Women, my dear fellow; women!\"\n\n\"I don\'t understand it,\" replied Prince Andrew. \"Women who are comme\nil faut, that\'s a different matter; but the Kuragins\' set of women,\n\'women and wine\' I don\'t understand!\"\n\nPierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin\'s and sharing the\ndissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to\nreform by marrying him to Prince Andrew\'s sister.\n\n\"Do you know?\" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy\nthought, \"seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading\nsuch a life I can\'t decide or think properly about anything. One\'s\nhead aches, and one spends all one\'s money. He asked me for tonight,\nbut I won\'t go.\"\n\n\"You give me your word of honor not to go?\"\n\n\"On my honor!\"');

It was a\ncloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending\nto drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more\nhe felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was\nlight enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed\nmore like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre\nremembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for\ncards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout,\nfinishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.\n\n\"I should like to go to Kuragin\'s,\" thought he.\n\nBut he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go\nthere. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so\npassionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so\naccustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately\noccurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account,\nbecause before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to\ncome to his gathering; \"besides,\" thought he, \"all such \'words of\nhonor\' are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if\none considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so\nextraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all\nthe same!\" Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort,\nnullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kuragin\'s.\n\nReaching the large house near the Horse Guards\' barracks, in which\nAnatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the\nstairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the\nanteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there\nwas a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the\ndistance.\n\nCards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet\ndispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in\nwhich were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw\nhim, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the\nthird room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices,\nthe growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine\nyoung men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others\nwere romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and\ntrying to set him at the others.\n\n\"I bet a hundred on Stevens!\" shouted one.\n\n\"Mind, no holding on!\" cried another.\n\n\"I bet on Dolokhov!\" cried a third. \"Kuragin, you part our hands.\"\n\n\"There, leave Bruin alone; here\'s a bet on.\"\n\n\"At one draught, or he loses!\" shouted a fourth.\n\n\"Jacob, bring a bottle!\" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow\nwho stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine\nlinen shirt unfastened in front. \"Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here\nis Petya! Good man!\" cried he, addressing Pierre.\n\nAnother voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,\nparticularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober\nring, cried from the window: \"Come here; part the bets!\" This was\nDolokhov, an officer of the Semenov regiment, a notorious gambler\nand duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about\nhim merrily.\n\n\"I don\'t understand. What\'s it all about?\"\n\n\"Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,\" said Anatole,\ntaking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.\n\n\"First of all you must drink!\"\n\nPierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows\nat the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and\nlistening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre\'s glass\nwhile explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens, an English\nnaval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the\nouter ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.\n\n\"Go on, you must drink it all,\" said Anatole, giving Pierre the last\nglass, \"or I won\'t let you go!\"\n\n\"No, I won\'t,\" said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to\nthe window.\n\nDolokhov was holding the Englishman\'s hand and clearly and\ndistinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself\nparticularly to Anatole and Pierre.\n\nDolokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue\neyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore\nno mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face,\nwas clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely\ncurved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed\nfirmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles\nplayed continually round the two corners of the mouth; this,\ntogether with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes,\nproduced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.\nDolokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though\nAnatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dolokhov lived with him and\nhad placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including\nAnatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dolokhov\ncould play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank,\nhe never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at\nthat time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.\n\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented\nanyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two\nfootmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions\nand shouts of the gentlemen around.\n\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted\nto smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame,\nbut could not move it. He smashed a pane.\n\n\"You have a try, Hercules,\" said he, turning to Pierre.\n\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame\nout with a crash.\n\n\"Take it right out, or they\'ll think I\'m holding on,\" said Dolokhov.\n\n\"Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?\" said Anatole.\n\n\"First-rate,\" said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who with a bottle of\nrum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of\nthe sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.\n\nDolokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the\nwindow sill. \"Listen!\" cried he, standing there and addressing those\nin the room. All were silent.\n\n\"I bet fifty imperials\"--he spoke French that the Englishman might\nunderstand him, but he did, not speak it very well--\"I bet fifty\nimperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?\" added he,\naddressing the Englishman.\n\n\"No, fifty,\" replied the latter.\n\n\"All right. Fifty imperials... that I will drink a whole bottle of\nrum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on\nthis spot\" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the\nwindow) \"and without holding on to anything. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said the Englishman.\n\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons\nof his coat and looking down at him--the Englishman was short--began\nrepeating the terms of the wager to him in English.\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Dolokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill\nto attract attention. \"Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone else\ndoes the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?\"\n\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to\naccept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and\nthough he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on\ntranslating Dolokhov\'s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar\nof the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the\nwindow sill, leaned over, and looked down.\n\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" he muttered, looking down from the window at the\nstones of the pavement.\n\n\"Shut up!\" cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad\njumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.\n\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it\neasily, Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and\nlowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he\nadjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the\nright and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought\ntwo candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was\nalready quite light. Dolokhov\'s back in his white shirt, and his curly\nhead, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the\nEnglishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older\nthan the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and\nangry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov\'s shirt.\n\n\"I say, this is folly! He\'ll be killed,\" said this more sensible\nman.\n\nAnatole stopped him.\n\n\"Don\'t touch him! You\'ll startle him and then he\'ll be killed.\nEh?... What then?... Eh?\"\n\nDolokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands,\narranged himself on his seat.\n\n\"If anyone comes meddling again,\" said he, emitting the words\nseparately through his thin compressed lips, \"I will throw him down\nthere. Now then!\"\n\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the\nbottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised\nhis free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped\nto pick up some broken glass remained in that position without\ntaking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhov\'s back. Anatole\nstood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways,\npursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran\nto a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to\nthe wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade\nthough his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still.\nPierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov still sat in the same\nposition, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair\ntouched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted\nhigher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was\nemptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting\nyet further back. \"Why is it so long?\" thought Pierre. It seemed to\nhim that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made\na backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously;\nthis was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the\nsloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered\nstill more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the\nwindow sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered\nhis eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he\nwas aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on\nthe window sill, with a pale but radiant face.\n\n\"It\'s empty.\"\n\nHe threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.\nDolokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.\n\n\"Well done!... Fine fellow!... There\'s a bet for you!... Devil\ntake you!\" came from different sides.\n\nThe Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the\nmoney. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon\nthe window sill.\n\n\"Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I\'ll do the same thing!\" he\nsuddenly cried. \"Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a\nbottle. I\'ll do it.... Bring a bottle!\"\n\n\"Let him do it, let him do it,\" said Dolokhov, smiling.\n\n\"What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why,\nyou go giddy even on a staircase,\" exclaimed several voices.\n\n\"I\'ll drink it! Let\'s have a bottle of rum!\" shouted Pierre, banging\nthe table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb\nout of the window.\n\nThey seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone\nwho touched him was sent flying.\n\n\"No, you\'ll never manage him that way,\" said Anatole. \"Wait a bit\nand I\'ll get round him.... Listen! I\'ll take your bet tomorrow, but\nnow we are all going to ----\'s.\"\n\n\"Come on then,\" cried Pierre. \"Come on!... And we\'ll take Bruin with\nus.\"\n\nAnd he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the\nground, and began dancing round the room with it.');

The matter was mentioned to the\nEmperor, an exception made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of\nSemenov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no\nappointment to Kutuzov\'s staff despite all Anna Mikhaylovna\'s\nendeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pavlovna\'s reception Anna\nMikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich\nrelations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when in the town and\nwhere her darling Bory, who had only just entered a regiment\nof the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a\ncornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a\ntime. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August,\nand her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join\nthem on the march to Radzivilov.\n\nIt was St. Natalia\'s day and the name day of two of the Rostovs--the\nmother and the youngest daughter--both named Nataly. Ever since the\nmorning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going\ncontinually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostova\'s big house\non the Povarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself\nand her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing-room with the\nvisitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one\nanother in relays.\n\nThe countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental\ntype of face, evidently worn out with childbearing--she had had\ntwelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness,\ngave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna\nMikhaylovna Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also\nseated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the\nvisitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not\nconsidering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The\ncount met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.\n\n\"I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,\" or \"ma chere\"--he\ncalled everyone without exception and without the slightest\nvariation in his tone, \"my dear,\" whether they were above or below him\nin rank--\"I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose\nname day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be\noffended, ma chere! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come,\nmon cher!\" These words he repeated to everyone without exception or\nvariation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful,\nclean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same\nquick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned\nto one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair\ntoward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his\nhands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how\nto live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the\nweather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and\nsometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a\nman weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see\nsome visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald\npatch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the\nanteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the\nlarge marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty\npeople; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and\nchina, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would\ncall Dmitri Vasilevich, a man of good family and the manager of all\nhis affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table\nwould say: \"Well, Dmitri, you\'ll see that things are all as they\nshould be? That\'s right! The great thing is the serving, that\'s it.\"\nAnd with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.\n\n\"Marya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter!\" announced the countess\'\ngigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The\ncountess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with\nher husband\'s portrait on it.\n\n\"I\'m quite worn out by these callers. However, I\'ll see her and no\nmore. She is so affected. Ask her in,\" she said to the footman in a\nsad voice, as if saying: \"Very well, finish me off.\"\n\nA tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling\ndaughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.\n\n\"Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child...\nat the Razumovski\'s ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so\ndelighted...\" came the sounds of animated feminine voices,\ninterrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and\nthe scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which\nlast out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of\ndresses and say, \"I am so delighted... Mamma\'s health... and\nCountess Apraksina...\" and then, again rustling, pass into the\nanteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation\nwas on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and\ncelebrated beau of Catherine\'s day, Count Bezukhov, and about his\nillegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna\nPavlovna\'s reception.\n\n\"I am so sorry for the poor count,\" said the visitor. \"He is in such\nbad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill\nhim!\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the countess as if she did not know what the\nvisitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of\nCount Bezukhov\'s distress some fifteen times.\n\n\"That\'s what comes of a modern education,\" exclaimed the visitor.\n\"It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as\nhe liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible\nthings that he has been expelled by the police.\"\n\n\"You don\'t say so!\" replied the countess.\n\n\"He chose his friends badly,\" interposed Anna Mikhaylovna. \"Prince\nVasili\'s son, he, and a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been up\nto heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.\nDolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhov\'s son sent back\nto Moscow. Anatole Kuragin\'s father managed somehow to get his son\'s\naffair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.\"\n\n\"But what have they been up to?\" asked the countess.\n\n\"They are regular brigands, especially Dolokhov,\" replied the\nvisitor. \"He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, such a worthy\nwoman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear\nsomewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some\nactresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men\ndo? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear\ninto the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the\npoliceman on his back!\"\n\n\"What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!\" shouted\nthe count, dying with laughter.\n\n\"Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?\"\n\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n\n\"It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,\" continued the\nvisitor. \"And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov\'s son who\namuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so\nwell educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has\ndone for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in\nspite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite\ndeclined: I have my daughters to consider.\"\n\n\"Why do you say this young man is so rich?\" asked the countess,\nturning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of\ninattention. \"His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also\nis illegitimate.\"\n\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n\n\"I should think he has a score of them.\"\n\nPrincess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation,\nevidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went\non in society.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is,\" said she significantly, and also in a\nhalf whisper, \"everyone knows Count Cyril\'s reputation.... He has lost\ncount of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.\"\n\n\"How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!\" remarked the\ncountess. \"I have never seen a handsomer man.\"\n\n\"He is very much altered now,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna. \"Well, as I\nwas saying, Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the\ncount is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to\nthe Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death--and he is\nso ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from\nPetersburg--no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune,\nPierre or Prince Vasili.

He\'s also\nmy Bory\'s godfather,\" she added, as if she attached no importance at\nall to the fact.\n\n\"Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on\nsome inspection business,\" remarked the visitor.\n\n\"Yes, but between ourselves,\" said the princess, \"that is a\npretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladimirovich,\nhearing how ill he is.\"\n\n\"But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,\" said the count;\nand seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to\nthe young ladies. \"I can just imagine what a funny figure that\npoliceman cut!\"\n\nAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly\nform again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who\nalways eats well and, in particular, drinks well. \"So do come and dine\nwith us!\" he said.');

The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,\nbut not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they\nnow rose and took their leave. The visitor\'s daughter was already\nsmoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when\nsuddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls\nrunning to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a\ngirl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin\nfrock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was\nevident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far.\nBehind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat\ncollar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump\nrosy-faced boy in a short jacket.\n\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his\narms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.\n\n\"Ah, here she is!\" he exclaimed laughing. \"My pet, whose name day it\nis. My dear pet!\"\n\n\"Ma chere, there is a time for everything,\" said the countess with\nfeigned severity. \"You spoil her, Ilya,\" she added, turning to her\nhusband.\n\n\"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your\nname day,\" said the visitor. \"What a charming child,\" she added,\naddressing the mother.\n\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life--with\nchildish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her\nbodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs\nin lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers--was just at that\ncharming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not\nyet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her\nflushed face in the lace of her mother\'s mantilla--not paying the\nleast attention to her severe remark--and began to laugh. She laughed,\nand in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she\nproduced from the folds of her frock.\n\n\"Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...\" was all Natasha\nmanaged to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned\nagainst her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter\nthat even the prim visitor could not help joining in.\n\n\"Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,\" said the\nmother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and\nturning to the visitor she added: \"She is my youngest girl.\"\n\nNatasha, raising her face for a moment from her mother\'s mantilla,\nglanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.\n\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it\nnecessary to take some part in it.\n\n\"Tell me, my dear,\" said she to Natasha, \"is Mimi a relation of\nyours? A daughter, I suppose?\"\n\nNatasha did not like the visitor\'s tone of condescension to childish\nthings. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.\n\nMeanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna\nMikhaylovna\'s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count\'s eldest\nson; Sonya, the count\'s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya,\nhis youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were\nobviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the\nexcitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the\nback rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the\nconversation had been more amusing than the drawing-room talk of\nsociety scandals, the weather, and Countess Apraksina. Now and then\nthey glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.\n\nThe two young men, the student and the officer, friends from\nchildhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though\nnot alike. Boris was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had\nregular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and\nan open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper\nlip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas\nblushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find\nsomething to say, but failed. Boris on the contrary at once found\nhis footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that\ndoll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was\nbroken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and\nhow her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he\nglanced at Natasha. She turned away from him and glanced at her\nyounger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with\nsuppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she\njumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet\nwould carry her. Boris did not laugh.\n\n\"You were meaning to go out, weren\'t you, Mamma? Do you want the\ncarriage?\" he asked his mother with a smile.\n\n\"Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,\" she answered,\nreturning his smile.\n\nBoris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha. The plump\nboy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been\ndisturbed.');

Sonya was a slender\nlittle brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by\nlong lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a\ntawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her\nslender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her\nmovements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and\nby a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a\npretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful\nlittle cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest\nin the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her\neyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to\njoin the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile\ncould not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear\nthat the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy\nand again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natasha\nand Boris, escape from the drawing room.\n\n\"Ah yes, my dear,\" said the count, addressing the visitor and\npointing to Nicholas, \"his friend Boris has become an officer, and\nso for friendship\'s sake he is leaving the university and me, his\nold father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there\nwas a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department!\nIsn\'t that friendship?\" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.\n\n\"But they say that war has been declared,\" replied the visitor.\n\n\"They\'ve been saying so a long while,\" said the count, \"and\nthey\'ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My\ndear, there\'s friendship for you,\" he repeated. \"He\'s joining the\nhussars.\"\n\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n\n\"It\'s not at all from friendship,\" declared Nicholas, flaring up and\nturning away as if from a shameful aspersion. \"It is not from\nfriendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.\"\n\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were\nboth regarding him with a smile of approbation.\n\n\"Schubert, the colonel of the Pavlograd Hussars, is dining with us\ntoday. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.\nIt can\'t be helped!\" said the count, shrugging his shoulders and\nspeaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.\n\n\"I have already told you, Papa,\" said his son, \"that if you don\'t\nwish to let me go, I\'ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except\nin the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.--I don\'t\nknow how to hide what I feel.\" As he spoke he kept glancing with the\nflirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady\nvisitor.\n\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any\nmoment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n\n\"All right, all right!\" said the old count. \"He always flares up!\nThis Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he\nrose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,\"\nhe added, not noticing his visitor\'s sarcastic smile.\n\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karagina turned to\nyoung Rostov.\n\n\"What a pity you weren\'t at the Arkharovs\' on Thursday. It was so\ndull without you,\" said she, giving him a tender smile.\n\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish\nsmile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation\nwithout at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the\nheart of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of\nhis talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry\nglance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the\nartificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All\nNicholas\' animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the\nconversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find\nSonya.\n\n\"How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their\nsleeves!\" said Anna Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went\nout. \"Cousinage--dangereux voisinage;\"* she added.\n\n\n*Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said the countess when the brightness these young people\nhad brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question\nno one had put but which was always in her mind, \"and how much\nsuffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might\nrejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than\nthe joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age,\nso dangerous both for girls and boys.\"\n\n\"It all depends on the bringing up,\" remarked the visitor.\n\n\"Yes, you\'re quite right,\" continued the countess. \"Till now I\nhave always, thank God, been my children\'s friend and had their full\nconfidence,\" said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who\nimagine that their children have no secrets from them. \"I know I shall\nalways be my daughters\' first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with\nhis impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can\'t help it), he\nwill all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,\" chimed in the\ncount, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by\ndeciding that everything was splendid. \"Just fancy: wants to be an\nhussar. What\'s one to do, my dear?\"\n\n\"What a charming creature your younger girl is,\" said the visitor;\n\"a little volcano!\"\n\n\"Yes, a regular volcano,\" said the count. \"Takes after me! And\nwhat a voice she has; though she\'s my daughter, I tell the truth\nwhen I say she\'ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an\nItalian to give her lessons.\"\n\n\"Isn\'t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to\ntrain it at that age.\"\n\n\"Oh no, not at all too young!\" replied the count. \"Why, our\nmothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.\"\n\n\"And she\'s in love with Boris already. Just fancy!\" said the\ncountess with a gentle smile, looking at Boris\' and went on, evidently\nconcerned with a thought that always occupied her: \"Now you see if I\nwere to be severe with her and to forbid it... goodness knows what\nthey might be up to on the sly\" (she meant that they would be\nkissing), \"but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come\nrunning to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything.\nPerhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her\nelder sister I was stricter.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was brought up quite differently,\" remarked the handsome\nelder daughter, Countess Vera, with a smile.\n\nBut the smile did not enhance Vera\'s beauty as smiles generally do; on\nthe contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,\nexpression. Vera was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at\nlearning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said\nwas true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone--the visitors\nand countess alike--turned to look at her as if wondering why she had\nsaid it, and they all felt awkward.\n\n\"People are always too clever with their eldest children and try\nto make something exceptional of them,\" said the visitor.\n\n\"What\'s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too\nclever with Vera,\" said the count. \"Well, what of that? She\'s turned\nout splendidly all the same,\" he added, winking at Vera.\n\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to\ndinner.\n\n\"What manners! I thought they would never go,\" said the countess,\nwhen she had seen her guests out.');

At this Natasha dashed swiftly\namong the flower tubs and hid there.\n\nBoris paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a\nlittle dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror\nexamined his handsome face. Natasha, very still, peered out from her\nambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while\nbefore the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natasha\nwas about to call him but changed her mind. \"Let him look for me,\"\nthought she. Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears,\nand muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Natasha checked\nher first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place,\nwatching--as under an invisible cap--to see what went on in the world.\nShe was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure.

Here, here!\" and she led him into the\nconservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.\n\nBoris followed her, smiling.\n\n\"What is the something?\" asked he.\n\nShe grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had\nthrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.\n\n\"Kiss the doll,\" said she.\n\nBoris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not\nreply.\n\n\"Don\'t you want to? Well, then, come here,\" said she, and went\nfurther in among the plants and threw down the doll. \"Closer, closer!\"\nshe whispered.\n\nShe caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity\nand fear appeared on her flushed face.\n\n\"And me? Would you like to kiss me?\" she whispered almost inaudibly,\nglancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying\nfrom excitement.\n\nBoris blushed.\n\n\"How funny you are!\" he said, bending down to her and blushing still\nmore, but he waited and did nothing.\n\nSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him\nso that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and,\ntossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.\n\nThen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of\nthe tubs and stood, hanging her head.\n\n\"Natasha,\" he said, \"you know that I love you, but...\"\n\n\"You are in love with me?\" Natasha broke in.\n\n\"Yes, I am, but please don\'t let us do like that....

Boris and Natasha were at\nthe other window and ceased talking when Vera entered. Sonya and\nNatasha looked at Vera with guilty, happy faces.\n\nIt was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love;\nbut apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vera.\n\n\"How often have I asked you not to take my things?\" she said. \"You\nhave a room of your own,\" and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.\n\n\"In a minute, in a minute,\" he said, dipping his pen.\n\n\"You always manage to do things at the wrong time,\" continued\nVera. \"You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt\nashamed of you.\"\n\nThough what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no\none replied, and the four simply looked at one another.

Would you believe it, I have literally not a\npenny and don\'t know how to equip Boris.\" She took out her\nhandkerchief and began to cry. \"I need five hundred rubles, and have\nonly one twenty-five-ruble note.

If he will not assist\nhis godson--you know he is Bory\'s godfather--and allow him something\nfor his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I\nshall not be able to equip him.\"\n\nThe countess\' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.\n\n\"I often think, though, perhaps it\'s a sin,\" said the princess,\n\"that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich, all\nalone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It\'s a\nburden to him, and Bory\'s life is only just beginning....\"\n\n\"Surely he will leave something to Boris,\" said the countess.\n\n\"Heaven only knows, my dear!

There\nwill just be time.\"\n\nAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the\nmost of time, Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son, and\nwent into the anteroom with him.\n\n\"Good-by, my dear,\" said she to the countess who saw her to the\ndoor, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, \"Wish me\ngood luck.\"\n\n\"Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich, my dear?\" said the\ncount coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:\n\"If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us.

Please announce me.\"\n\nThe hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and\nturned away.\n\n\"Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich,\" he called to\na footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,\nwho ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.\n\nThe mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a\nlarge Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes\nbriskly ascended the carpeted stairs.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a\ntouch, \"you promised me!\"\n\nThe son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.\n\nThey entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to\nthe apartments assigned to Prince Vasili.\n\nJust as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall,\nwere about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as\nthey entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and\nPrince Vasili came out--wearing a velvet coat with a single star on\nhis breast, as was his custom when at home--taking leave of a\ngood-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg\ndoctor, Lorrain.\n\n\"Then it is certain?\" said the prince.\n\n\"Prince, humanum est errare,* but...\" replied the doctor, swallowing\nhis r\'s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.\n\n\n*To err is human.\n\n\n\"Very well, very well...\"\n\nSeeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her son, Prince Vasili dismissed the\ndoctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of\ninquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow\nsuddenly clouded his mother\'s face, and he smiled slightly.\n\n\"Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our\ndear invalid?\" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive\nlook fixed on her.\n\nPrince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and\nperplexed. Boris bowed politely. Prince Vasili without acknowledging\nthe bow turned to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a\nmovement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the\npatient.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna. \"Oh, how awful! It\nis terrible to think.... This is my son,\" she added, indicating Boris.\n\"He wanted to thank you himself.\"\n\nBoris bowed again politely.\n\n\"Believe me, Prince, a mother\'s heart will never forget what you\nhave done for us.\"\n\n\"I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna\nMikhaylovna,\" said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, and in\ntone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed\nunder an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than\nhe had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherer\'s reception.\n\n\"Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,\" added he, addressing\nBoris with severity. \"I am glad.... Are you here on leave?\" he went on\nin his usual tone of indifference.\n\n\"I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,\"\nreplied Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince\'s brusque\nmanner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so\nquietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.\n\n\"Are you living with your mother?\"\n\n\"I am living at Countess Rostova\'s,\" replied Boris, again adding,\n\"your excellency.\"\n\n\"That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina,\" said\nAnna Mikhaylovna.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice. \"I\nnever could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that\nunlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler\ntoo, I am told.\"\n\n\"But a very kind man, Prince,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic\nsmile, as though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure,\nbut asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. \"What do the\ndoctors say?\" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again\nexpressing deep sorrow.\n\n\"They give little hope,\" replied the prince.\n\n\"And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me\nand Boris. He is his godson,\" she added, her tone suggesting that this\nfact ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction.\n\nPrince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikhaylovna saw\nthat he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhov\'s\nfortune, and hastened to reassure him.\n\n\"If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,\"\nsaid she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern,\n\"I know his character: noble, upright... but you see he has no one\nwith him except the young princesses.... They are still young....\" She\nbent her head and continued in a whisper: \"Has he performed his\nfinal duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can\nmake things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if\nhe is so ill. We women, Prince,\" and she smiled tenderly, \"always know\nhow to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it\nmay be for me. I am used to suffering.\"\n\nEvidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he\nhad done at Anna Pavlovna\'s, that it would be difficult to get rid\nof Anna Mikhaylovna.\n\n\"Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna\nMikhaylovna?\" said he. \"Let us wait until evening. The doctors are\nexpecting a crisis.\"\n\n\"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the\nwelfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a\nChristian...\"\n\nA door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses,\nthe count\'s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of\nher body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince\nVasili turned to her.\n\n\"Well, how is he?\"\n\n\"Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...\" said the\nprincess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy\nsmile, ambling lightly up to the count\'s niece. \"I have come, and am\nat your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have\ngone through,\" and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.\n\nThe princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room\nas Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position\nshe had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasili\nto take a seat beside her.\n\n\"Boris,\" she said to her son with a smile, \"I shall go in to see the\ncount, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile\nand don\'t forget to give him the Rostovs\' invitation. They ask him\nto dinner. I suppose he won\'t go?\" she continued, turning to the\nprince.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied the prince, who had plainly become\ndepressed, \"I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young\nman.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Boris down one flight\nof stairs and up another, to Pierre\'s rooms.');

The story told about him at Count Rostov\'s was true.\nPierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been\nfor some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father\'s\nhouse. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be\nalready known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father--who were\nnever favorably disposed toward him--would have used it to turn the\ncount against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to\nhis father\'s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the\nprincesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of\nwhom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It\nwas the eldest who was reading--the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna.\nThe two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and\nthey differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made\nher much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a\nleper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared\nat him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same\nexpression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a\ncheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile\nprobably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool\ndown through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing,\nstooped as if trying to make out the pattern.\n\n\"How do you do, cousin?\" said Pierre. \"You don\'t recognize me?\"\n\n\"I recognize you only too well, too well.\"\n\n\"How is the count? Can I see him?\" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,\nbut unabashed.\n\n\"The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently\nyou have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.\"\n\n\"Can I see the count?\" Pierre again asked.\n\n\"Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see\nhim... Olga, go and see whether Uncle\'s beef tea is ready--it is\nalmost time,\" she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were\nbusy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,\nPierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.\n\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed\nand said: \"Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can\nsee him.\"\n\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of\nthe sister with the mole.\n\nNext day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count\'s house.\nHe sent for Pierre and said to him: \"My dear fellow, if you are\ngoing to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very\nbadly; that is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very\nill, and you must not see him at all.\"\n\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole\ntime in his rooms upstairs.\n\nWhen Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his\nroom, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at\nthe wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and\nglaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his\nwalk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and\ngesticulating.\n\n\"England is done for,\" said he, scowling and pointing his finger\nat someone unseen. \"Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the\nrights of man, is sentenced to...\" But before Pierre--who at that\nmoment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just\neffected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured\nLondon--could pronounce Pitt\'s sentence, he saw a well-built and\nhandsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left\nMoscow when Boris was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten\nhim, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Boris by the\nhand with a friendly smile.\n\n\"Do you remember me?\" asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile.\n\"I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not\nwell.\"\n\n\"Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,\"\nanswered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.\n\nBoris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it\nnecessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least\nembarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.\n\n\"Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today,\" said he, after a\nconsiderable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"Ah, Count Rostov!\" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. \"Then you are his\nson, Ilya? Only fancy, I didn\'t know you at first. Do you remember how\nwe went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It\'s such an\nage...\"\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" said Boris deliberately, with a bold and\nslightly sarcastic smile. \"I am Boris, son of Princess Anna\nMikhaylovna Drubetskaya. Rostov, the father, is Ilya, and his son is\nNicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.\"\n\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.\n\n\"Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I\'ve mixed everything up. One\nhas so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of course. Well,\nnow we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne\nexpedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon\ngets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible.\nIf only Villeneuve doesn\'t make a mess of things!\"\n\nBoris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read\nthe papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve\'s name.\n\n\"We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal\nthan with politics,\" said he in his quiet ironical tone. \"I know\nnothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy\nwith gossip,\" he continued. \"Just now they are talking about you and\nyour father.\"\n\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his\ncompanion\'s sake that the latter might say something he would\nafterwards regret. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly,\nlooking straight into Pierre\'s eyes.\n\n\"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,\" Boris went on.\n\"Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,\nthough he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...\"\n\n\"Yes, it is all very horrid,\" interrupted Pierre, \"very horrid.\"\n\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say\nsomething disconcerting to himself.\n\n\"And it must seem to you,\" said Boris flushing slightly, but not\nchanging his tone or attitude, \"it must seem to you that everyone is\ntrying to get something out of the rich man?\"\n\n\"So it does,\" thought Pierre.\n\n\"But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are\nquite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are\nvery poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that\nyour father is rich, I don\'t regard myself as a relation of his, and\nneither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.\"\n\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he\njumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his quick,\nclumsy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to speak with a\nfeeling of mingled shame and vexation.\n\n\"Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I\nknow very well...\"\n\nBut Boris again interrupted him.\n\n\"I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You\nmust excuse me,\" said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being\nput at ease by him, \"but I hope I have not offended you. I always make\nit a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you\ncome to dinner at the Rostovs\'?\"\n\nAnd Boris, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and\nextricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,\nbecame quite pleasant again.\n\n\"No, but I say,\" said Pierre, calming down, \"you are a wonderful\nfellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you\ndon\'t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we\nwere children. You might think that I... I understand, quite\nunderstand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the\ncourage, but it\'s splendid. I am very glad to have made your\nacquaintance. It\'s queer,\" he added after a pause, \"that you should\nhave suspected me!\" He began to laugh. \"Well, what of it! I hope we\'ll\nget better acquainted,\" and he pressed Boris\' hand. \"Do you know, I\nhave not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I\nam sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?\"\n\n\"And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?\" asked\nBoris with a smile.\n\nPierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject, and being of the\nsame mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe Boulogne expedition.\n\nA footman came in to summon Boris--the princess was going. Pierre,\nin order to make Boris\' better acquaintance, promised to come to\ndinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his\nspectacles into Boris\' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing\nup and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an\nimaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance\nof that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.\n\nAs often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a\nlonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man\nand made up his mind that they would be friends.\n\nPrince Vasili saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her\neyes and her face was tearful.\n\n\"It is dreadful, dreadful!\" she was saying, \"but cost me what it may\nI shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be\nleft like this. Every moment is precious. I can\'t think why his nieces\nput it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare\nhim!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you...\"\n\n\"Adieu, ma bonne,\" answered Prince Vasili turning away from her.\n\n\"Oh, he is in a dreadful state,\" said the mother to her son when\nthey were in the carriage. \"He hardly recognizes anybody.\"\n\n\"I don\'t understand, Mamma--what is his attitude to Pierre?\" asked\nthe son.\n\n\"The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.\"\n\n\"But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!\"\n\n\"Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...\"\n\n\"Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!\" exclaimed the mother.');

The count took the gentlemen\ninto his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes.\nFrom time to time he went out to ask: \"Hasn\'t she come yet?\" They were\nexpecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, known in society as le\nterrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but\nfor common sense and frank plainness of speech. Marya Dmitrievna was\nknown to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and\nPetersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at\nher rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less\nall without exception respected and feared her.\n\nIn the count\'s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of\nwar that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the\nrecruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew\nit had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were\nsmoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his\nhead first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers\nwith evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two\nneighbors, whom he egged on against each other.\n\nOne of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and\nwrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a\nmost fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as\nif quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his\nmouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his\neyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the countess\', a\nman with \"a sharp tongue\" as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to\nbe condescending to his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer\nof the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held\nhis pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled\nthe smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This\nwas Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom\nBoris was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natasha had,\nteased her elder sister Vera, speaking of Berg as her \"intended.\"\nThe count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite\noccupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of,\nwas that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two\nloquacious talkers at one another.\n\n\"Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich,\"\nsaid Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary\nRussian expressions with the choicest French phrases--which was a\npeculiarity of his speech. \"Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur\nl\'etat;* you want to make something out of your company?\"\n\n\n*You expect to make an income out of the government.\n\n\n\"No, Peter Nikolaevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry\nthe advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own\nposition now, Peter Nikolaevich...\"\n\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His\nconversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain\ncalm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no\ndirect bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without\nbeing at all put out of countenance himself or making others\nuncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he\nwould begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.\n\n\"Consider my position, Peter Nikolaevich. Were I in the cavalry I\nshould get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even\nwith the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and\nthirty,\" said he, looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful,\npleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must\nalways be the chief desire of everyone else.\n\n\"Besides that, Peter Nikolaevich, by exchanging into the Guards I\nshall be in a more prominent position,\" continued Berg, \"and vacancies\noccur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what\ncan be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a\nlittle aside and to send something to my father,\" he went on, emitting\na smoke ring.\n\n\"La balance y est...* A German knows how to skin a flint, as the\nproverb says,\" remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the other side of\nhis mouth and winking at the count.\n\n\n*So that squares matters.\n\n\nThe count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that\nShinshin was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or\nindifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards\nhe had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps;\nhow in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as\nsenior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular\nhe was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was\nwith him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not\nseem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests.\nBut all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naivete of his\nyouthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.\n\n\"Well, my boy, you\'ll get along wherever you go--foot or horse--that\nI\'ll warrant,\" said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking\nhis feet off the sofa.\n\nBerg smiled joyously. The count, by his guests, went into the\ndrawing room.\n\nIt was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled\nguests, expecting the summons to zakuska,* avoid engaging in any\nlong conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in\norder to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The\nhost and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at\none another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who,\nor what, they are waiting for--some important relation who has not yet\narrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.\n\n\n*Hors d\'oeuvres.\n\n\nPierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in\nthe middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come\nacross, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make\nhim talk, but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles\nas if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in\nmonosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not\nnotice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the\nbear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering\nhow such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a\npoliceman.\n\n\"You have only lately arrived?\" the countess asked him.\n\n\"Oui, madame,\" replied he, looking around him.\n\n\"You have not yet seen my husband?\"\n\n\"Non, madame.\" He smiled quite inappropriately.\n\n\"You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it\'s very\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Very interesting.\"\n\nThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna. The latter\nunderstood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and\nsitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he\nanswered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other\nguests were all conversing with one another. \"The Razumovskis... It\nwas charming... You are very kind... Countess Apraksina...\" was\nheard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.\n\n\"Marya Dmitrievna?\" came her voice from there.\n\n\"Herself,\" came the answer in a rough voice, and Marya Dmitrievna\nentered the room.\n\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very\noldest rose. Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,\nholding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood\nsurveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if\nrolling them up. Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.\n\n\"Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to\nher children,\" she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned\nall others. \"Well, you old sinner,\" she went on, turning to the\ncount who was kissing her hand, \"you\'re feeling dull in Moscow, I\ndaresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old\nman? Just see how these nestlings are growing up,\" and she pointed\nto the girls. \"You must look for husbands for them whether you like it\nor not....\"\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"how\'s my Cossack?\" (Marya Dmitrievna always called\nNatasha a Cossack) and she stroked the child\'s arm as she came up\nfearless and gay to kiss her hand. \"I know she\'s a scamp of a girl,\nbut I like her.\"\n\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge\nreticule and, having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with\nthe pleasure of her saint\'s-day fete, turned away at once and\naddressed herself to Pierre.\n\n\"Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,\" said she, assuming a soft high\ntone of voice. \"Come here, my friend...\" and she ominously tucked up\nher sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a\nchildlike way through his spectacles.\n\n\"Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell\nyour father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it\'s my\nevident duty.\" She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to\nfollow, for this was dearly only a prelude.\n\n\"A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed\nand he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,\nsir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.\"\n\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly\nkeep from laughing.\n\n\"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?\" said Marya\nDmitrievna.\n\nThe count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess followed\non the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them\nbecause Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna\nMikhaylovna with Shinshin. Berg gave his arm to Vera. The smiling\nJulie Karagina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples\nfollowed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children,\ntutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen began moving\nabout, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the\nguests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count\'s\nhousehold band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the\nvoices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of\nthe table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna\nMikhaylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At\nthe other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and\nShinshin and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the\nlong table on one side sat the grownup young people: Vera beside Berg,\nand Pierre beside Boris; and on the other side, the children,\ntutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit\nvases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its\nlight-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors\' glasses, not\nneglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her\nduties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the\npineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their\nredness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies\'\nend an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men\'s end\nthe voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel\nof hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much\nthat the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with\ntender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a\nheavenly feeling. Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the\nguests were and exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting\nopposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a\ngreat deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and\nwent on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the\nwines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in\na napkin, from behind the next man\'s shoulders and whispered: \"Dry\nMadeira\"... \"Hungarian\"... or \"Rhine wine\" as the case might be. Of\nthe four crystal glasses engraved with the count\'s monogram that stood\nbefore his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with\nenjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests.\nNatasha, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen\nlook at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the\nfirst time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny\nlively little girl\'s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing\nwhy.\n\nNicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina,\nto whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sonya\nwore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now\nshe turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what\nNicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept\nlooking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might\nbe put upon the children. The German tutor was trying to remember\nall the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full\ndescription of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt\ngreatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin\npassed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want\nany of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand\nthat it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted\nit, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.');

He resented Shinshin\'s\nremark.\n\n\"It is for the reasson, my goot sir,\" said he, speaking with a\nGerman accent, \"for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He\ndeclares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze\ndanger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as\nvell as ze sanctity of its alliances...\" he spoke this last word\nwith particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.\n\nThen with the unerring official memory that characterized him he\nrepeated from the opening words of the manifesto:\n\n... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor\'s sole and\nabsolute aim--to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations--has\nnow decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a\nnew condition for the attainment of that purpose.\n\n\"Zat, my dear sir, is vy...\" he concluded, drinking a tumbler of\nwine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.\n\n\"Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* \'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but\nturn spindles at home!\'?\" said Shinshin, puckering his brows and\nsmiling. \"Cela nous convient a merveille.*[2] Suvorov now--he knew\nwhat he was about; yet they beat him a plate couture,*[3] and where\nare we to find Suvorovs now?

And how do you, a young man and a\nyoung hussar, how do you judge of it?\" he added, addressing\nNicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had\nturned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.\n\n\"I am quite of your opinion,\" replied Nicholas, flaming up,\nturning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as\nmuch decision and desperation as though he were at that moment\nfacing some great danger. \"I am convinced that we Russians must die or\nconquer,\" he concluded, conscious--as were others--after the words\nwere uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for\nthe occasion and were therefore awkward.\n\n\"What you said just now was splendid!\" said his partner Julie.\n\nSonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them\nand down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.\n\nPierre listened to the colonel\'s speech and nodded approvingly.\n\n\"That\'s fine,\" said he.\n\n\"The young man\'s a real hussar!\" shouted the colonel, again thumping\nthe table.\n\n\"What are you making such a noise about over there?\" Marya\nDmitrievna\'s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the\ntable. \"What are you thumping the table for?\" she demanded of the\nhussar, \"and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French\nare here?\"\n\n\"I am speaking ze truce,\" replied the hussar with a smile.\n\n\"It\'s all about the war,\" the count shouted down the table. \"You\nknow my son\'s going, Marya Dmitrievna? My son is going.\"\n\n\"I have four sons in the army but still I don\'t fret. It is all in\nGod\'s hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a\nbattle,\" replied Marya Dmitrievna\'s deep voice, which easily carried\nthe whole length of the table.\n\n\"That\'s true!\"\n\nOnce more the conversations concentrated, the ladies\' at the one end\nand the men\'s at the other.\n\n\"You won\'t ask,\" Natasha\'s little brother was saying; \"I know you\nwon\'t ask!\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Natasha.\n\nHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She\nhalf rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to\nwhat was coming, and turning to her mother:\n\n\"Mamma!\" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,\naudible the whole length of the table.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her\ndaughter\'s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her\nsternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.\n\nThe conversation was hushed.\n\n\"Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?\" and Natasha\'s voice\nsounded still more firm and resolute.\n\nThe countess tried to frown, but could not. Marya Dmitrievna shook\nher fat finger.\n\n\"Cossack!\" she said threateningly.\n\nMost of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at\nthe elders.\n\n\"You had better take care!\" said the countess.\n\n\"Mamma!

I have asked,\" whispered Natasha to her little brother and\nto Pierre, glancing at him again.\n\n\"Ice pudding, but you won\'t get any,\" said Marya Dmitrievna.\n\nNatasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even\nMarya Dmitrievna.\n\n\"Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don\'t like ice\ncream.\"\n\n\"Carrot ices.\"\n\n\"No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna?

Everyone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna\'s answer\nbut at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who\nhad dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion.\n\nNatasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be\npineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band\nagain struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests,\nleaving their seats, went up to \"congratulate\" the countess, and\nreached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the\nchildren, and with one another.

The young people, at the countess\' instigation, gathered\nround the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played\nfirst. After she had played a little air with variations on the\nharp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natasha and\nNicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing\nsomething. Natasha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was\nevidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.\n\n\"What shall we sing?\" she said.\n\n\"\'The Brook,\'\" suggested Nicholas.\n\n\"Well, then, let\'s be quick. Boris, come here,\" said Natasha. \"But\nwhere is Sonya?\"\n\nShe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room\nran to look for her.\n\nRunning into Sonya\'s room and not finding her there, Natasha ran\nto the nursery, but Sonya was not there either. Natasha concluded that\nshe must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage\nwas the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the\nRostov household. And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on\nNurse\'s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy\npink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and\nsobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook.\nNatasha\'s face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint\'s\nday, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed\ndown her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.\n\n\"Sonya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!\" And\nNatasha\'s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she\nbegan to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sonya was\ncrying. Sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and\nhid her face still deeper in the bed. Natasha wept, sitting on the\nblue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort\nSonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.\n\n\"Nicholas is going away in a week\'s time, his... papers... have\ncome... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,\" and she\nshowed a paper she held in her hand--with the verses Nicholas had\nwritten, \"still, I should not cry, but you can\'t... no one can\nunderstand... what a soul he has!\"\n\nAnd she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.\n\n\"It\'s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and\nBoris also,\" she went on, gaining a little strength; \"he is nice...\nthere are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...\none would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it\ncan\'t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma\" (Sonya looked upon the\ncountess as her mother and called her so) \"that I am spoiling\nNicholas\' career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God\nis my witness,\" and she made the sign of the cross, \"I love her so\nmuch, and all of you, only Vera... And what for? What have I done to\nher? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice\neverything, only I have nothing....\"\n\nSonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in\nthe feather bed. Natasha began consoling her, but her face showed that\nshe understood all the gravity of her friend\'s trouble.\n\n\"Sonya,\" she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true\nreason of her friend\'s sorrow, \"I\'m sure Vera has said something to\nyou since dinner? Hasn\'t she?\"\n\n\"Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some\nothers, and she found them on my table and said she\'d show them to\nMamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him\nto marry me, but that he\'ll marry Julie. You see how he\'s been with\nher all day... Natasha, what have I done to deserve it?...\"\n\nAnd again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natasha\nlifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began\ncomforting her.\n\n\"Sonya, don\'t believe her, darling! Don\'t believe her! Do you\nremember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting\nroom after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don\'t\nquite remember how, but don\'t you remember that it could all be\narranged and how nice it all was? There\'s Uncle Shinshin\'s brother has\nmarried his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.\nAnd Boris says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all\nabout it. And he is so clever and so good!\" said Natasha. \"Don\'t you\ncry, Sonya, dear love, darling Sonya!\" and she kissed her and laughed.\n\"Vera\'s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she\nwon\'t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he\ndoesn\'t care at all for Julie.\"\n\nNatasha kissed her on the hair.\n\nSonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it\nseemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin\nplaying with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.\n\n\"Do you think so?... Really? Truly?\" she said, quickly smoothing her\nfrock and hair.\n\n\"Really, truly!\" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp lock that\nhad strayed from under her friend\'s plaits.\n\nBoth laughed.\n\n\"Well, let\'s go and sing \'The Brook.\'\"\n\n\"Come along!\"\n\n\"Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!\" said\nNatasha, stopping suddenly. \"I feel so happy!\"\n\nAnd she set off at a run along the passage.\n\nSonya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the\nverses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran\nafter Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face\nand light, joyous steps. At the visitors\' request the young people\nsang the quartette, \"The Brook,\" with which everyone was delighted.\nThen Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:\n\n\n   At nighttime in the moon\'s fair glow\n     How sweet, as fancies wander free,\n   To feel that in this world there\'s one\n     Who still is thinking but of thee!\n\n   That while her fingers touch the harp\n     Wafting sweet music o\'er the lea,\n   It is for thee thus swells her heart,\n     Sighing its message out to thee...\n\n   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,\n     But oh! till then I cannot live!...\n\n\nHe had not finished the last verse before the young people began\nto get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and\nthe coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.\n\n\nPierre was sitting in the drawing-room where Shinshin had engaged\nhim, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political\nconversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre.\nWhen the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre\nsaid, laughing and blushing:\n\n\"Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.\"\n\n\"I am afraid of mixing the figures,\" Pierre replied; \"but if you\nwill be my teacher...\" And lowering his big arm he offered it to the\nslender little girl.\n\nWhile the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning\nup, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly\nhappy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She\nwas sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a\ngrown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had\ngiven her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman\n(heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her\npartner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.\n\n\"Dear, dear! Just look at her!\" exclaimed the countess as she\ncrossed the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.\n\nNatasha blushed and laughed.\n\n\"Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be\nsurprised at?\"\n\n\nIn the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs\nbeing pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya\nDmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more\ndistinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves\nafter sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks,\nentered the ballroom. First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count,\nboth with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony\nsomewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrievna. He\ndrew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and\nas soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped\nhis hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing\nthe first violin:\n\n\"Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?\"\n\nThis was the count\'s favorite dance, which he had danced in his\nyouth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the\nanglaise.)\n\n\"Look at Papa!\" shouted Natasha to the whole company, and quite\nforgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her\ncurly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her\nlaughter.\n\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure\nat the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout\npartner, Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened\nhis shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot,\nand, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more,\nprepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the\nprovocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling\nthose of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of\nthe ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs--the men on\none side and the women on the other--who with beaming faces had come\nto see their master making merry.\n\n\"Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!\" loudly remarked\nthe nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.\n\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did\nnot want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her\npowerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the\ncountess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the\ndance. What was expressed by the whole of the count\'s plump figure, in\nMarya Dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming\nface and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more\ninto the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness\nof his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on\nhis light feet, Marya Dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight\nexertions--the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms\nwhen turning, or stamp her foot--which everyone appreciated in view of\nher size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and\nlivelier. The other couples could not attract a moment\'s attention\nto their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were\nwatching the count and Marya Dmitrievna. Natasha kept pulling everyone\nby sleeve or dress, urging them to \"look at Papa!\" though as it was\nthey never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the\ndance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the\nmusicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more\nlightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Marya\nDmitrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his\npartner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft\nfoot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a\nwide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led\nby Natasha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping\ntheir faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.\n\n\"That\'s how we used to dance in our time, ma chere,\" said the count.\n\n\"That was a Daniel Cooper!\" exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, tucking up\nher sleeves and puffing heavily.');

The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a\nmute confession, communion was administered to the dying man,\npreparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there\nwas the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside\nthe house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid\nwhenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important\norder for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who\nhad been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the\ncount\'s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to\nthe celebrated grandee of Catherine\'s court, Count Bezukhov.\n\nThe magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up\nrespectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an\nhour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging\ntheir bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the\nglances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the\nfamily. Prince Vasili, who had grown thinner and paler during the last\nfew days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several\ntimes in low tones.\n\nWhen the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasili sat down all\nalone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the\nother, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his\nhand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him\nwith frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the\nlong corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the\neldest princess.\n\nThose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous\nwhispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying\nman\'s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or\nexpectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.\n\n\"The limits of human life... are fixed and may not be o\'erpassed,\"\nsaid an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was\nlistening naively to his words.\n\n\"I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?\" asked the\nlady, adding the priest\'s clerical title, as if she had no opinion\nof her own on the subject.\n\n\"Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,\" replied the priest, passing\nhis hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his\nbald head.\n\n\"Who was that? The Military Governor himself?\" was being asked at\nthe other side of the room. \"How young-looking he is!\"\n\n\"Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes\nanyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.\"\n\n\"I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.\"\n\nThe second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes\nred from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a\ngraceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a\ntable.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" said the doctor in answer to a remark about the\nweather. \"The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow\none feels as if one were in the country.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" replied the princess with a sigh. \"So he may have\nsomething to drink?\"\n\nLorrain considered.\n\n\"Has he taken his medicine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe doctor glanced at his watch.\n\n\"Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,\"\nand he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.\n\n\"Dere has neffer been a gase,\" a German doctor was saying to an\naide-de-camp, \"dat one liffs after de sird stroke.\"\n\n\"And what a well-preserved man he was!\" remarked the aide-de-camp.\n\"And who will inherit his wealth?\" he added in a whisper.\n\n\"It von\'t go begging,\" replied the German with a smile.\n\nEveryone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second\nprincess went in with the drink she had prepared according to\nLorrain\'s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.\n\n\"Do you think he can last till morning?\" asked the German,\naddressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.\n\nLorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger\nbefore his nose.\n\n\"Tonight, not later,\" said he in a low voice, and he moved away with\na decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to\nunderstand and state the patient\'s condition.\n\n\nMeanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess\' room.\n\nIn this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning\nbefore the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt\npastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture,\nwhatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white\nfeather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to\nbark.\n\n\"Ah, is it you, cousin?\"\n\nShe rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely\nsmooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and\ncovered with varnish.\n\n\"Has anything happened?\" she asked. \"I am so terrified.\"\n\n\"No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about\nbusiness, Catiche,\"* muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on\nthe chair she had just vacated. \"You have made the place warm, I\nmust say,\" he remarked. \"Well, sit down: let\'s have a talk.\"\n\n\n*Catherine.\n\n\n\"I thought perhaps something had happened,\" she said with her\nunchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the\nprince, she prepared to listen.\n\n\"I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can\'t.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear?\" said Prince Vasili, taking her hand and bending\nit downwards as was his habit.\n\nIt was plain that this \"well?\" referred to much that they both\nunderstood without naming.\n\nThe princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for\nher legs, looked directly at Prince Vasili with no sign of emotion\nin her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up\nat the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an\nexpression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting\nbefore long. Prince Vasili understood it as an expression of\nweariness.\n\n\"And I?\" he said; \"do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn\nout as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a\nvery serious talk.\"\n\nPrince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,\nnow on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant\nexpression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His\neyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly\nand at the next glanced round in alarm.\n\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony\nhands, looked attentively into Prince Vasili\'s eyes evidently resolved\nnot to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.\n\n\"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semenovna,\"\ncontinued Prince Vasili, returning to his theme, apparently not\nwithout an inner struggle; \"at such a moment as this one must think of\neverything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love\nyou all, like children of my own, as you know.\"\n\nThe princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the\nsame dull expression.\n\n\"And then of course my family has also to be considered,\" Prince\nVasili went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at\nher. \"You know, Catiche, that we--you three sisters, Mamontov, and\nmy wife--are the count\'s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it\nis for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me;\nbut, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for\nanything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,\" pointing\nto his portrait, \"definitely demanded that he should be called.\"\n\nPrince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess, but could not\nmake out whether she was considering what he had just said or\nwhether she was simply looking at him.\n\n\"There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,\" she\nreplied, \"and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow\nhis noble soul peacefully to leave this...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently,\nrubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little\ntable that he had pushed away. \"But... in short, the fact is... you\nknow yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he\nleft all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.\"\n\n\"He has made wills enough!\" quietly remarked the princess. \"But he\ncannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" said Prince Vasili suddenly, clutching the little\ntable and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: \"what if\na letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for\nPierre\'s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of\nthe count\'s services, his request would be granted?...\"\n\nThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about\nthe subject under discussion than those they are talking with.\n\n\"I can tell you more,\" continued Prince Vasili, seizing her hand,\n\"that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew\nof it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not,\nthen as soon as all is over,\" and Prince Vasili sighed to intimate\nwhat he meant by the words all is over, \"and the count\'s papers are\nopened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and\nthe petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything\nas the legitimate son.\"\n\n\"And our share?\" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if\nanything might happen, only not that.\n\n\"But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be\nthe legal heir to everything and you won\'t get anything. You must\nknow, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether\nthey have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been\noverlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them,\nbecause...\"\n\n\"What next?\" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and\nnot changing the expression of her eyes. \"I am a woman, and you\nthink we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot\ninherit... un batard!\"* she added, as if supposing that this\ntranslation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasili the\ninvalidity of his contention.\n\n\n*A bastard.\n\n\n\"Well, really, Catiche! Can\'t you understand! You are so\nintelligent, how is it you don\'t see that if the count has written a\nletter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate,\nit follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count\nBezukhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if\nthe will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing\nbut the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s\'ensuit!*\nThat\'s certain.\"\n\n\n*And all that follows therefrom.\n\n\n\"I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and\nyou, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,\" said the\nprincess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are\nsaying something witty and stinging.\n\n\"My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna,\" began Prince Vasili\nimpatiently, \"I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about\nyour interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I\ntell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and\nthe will in Pierre\'s favor are among the count\'s papers, then, my dear\ngirl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don\'t believe me,\nthen believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich\"\n(the family solicitor) \"and he says the same.\"\n\nAt this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess\' ideas;\nher thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her\nvoice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she\nherself evidently did not expect.\n\n\"That would be a fine thing!\" said she. \"I never wanted anything and\nI don\'t now.\"\n\nShe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.\n\n\"And this is gratitude--this is recognition for those who have\nsacrificed everything for his sake!\" she cried. \"It\'s splendid!\nFine! I don\'t want anything, Prince.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...\"\nreplied Prince Vasili.\n\nBut the princess did not listen to him.\n\n\"Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could\nexpect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and\ningratitude--the blackest ingratitude--in this house...\"\n\n\"Do you or do you not know where that will is?\" insisted Prince\nVasili, his cheeks twitching more than ever.\n\n\"Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and\nsacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has\nbeen intriguing!\"\n\nThe princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand.\nShe had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole\nhuman race. She gave her companion an angry glance.\n\n\"There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it\nwas all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was\nafterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to\nease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and\nnot to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...\"\n\n\"Who sacrificed everything for him,\" chimed in the princess, who\nwould again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, \"though\nhe never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,\" she added with a\nsigh, \"I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no\nreward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this\nworld one has to be cunning and cruel.\"\n\n\"Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.\"\n\n\"No, I have a wicked heart.\"\n\n\"I know your heart,\" repeated the prince. \"I value your friendship\nand wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don\'t upset yourself,\nand let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or\nbe it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above\nall where it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to\nthe count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.\nYou understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his\nwishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help\nhim and you.\"\n\n\"Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing--I know!\" cried\nthe princess.\n\n\"That\'s not the point, my dear.\"\n\n\"It\'s that protege of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskaya, that\nAnna Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the\ninfamous, vile woman!\"\n\n\"Do not let us lose any time...\"\n\n\"Ah, don\'t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here\nand told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us,\nespecially about Sophie--I can\'t repeat them--that it made the count\nquite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was\nthen he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was\ninvalid.\"\n\n\"We\'ve got to it at last--why did you not tell me about it sooner?\"\n\n\"It\'s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,\"\nsaid the princess, ignoring his question. \"Now I know! Yes; if I\nhave a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!\" almost\nshrieked the princess, now quite changed. \"And what does she come\nworming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind.\nThe time will come!\"');

As the wheels\nrolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikhaylovna,\nhaving turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he\nwas asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre\nfollowed Anna Mikhaylovna out of the carriage, and only then began\nto think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him.\nHe noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the\nback door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two\nmen, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and\nhid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed\nseveral other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house\non both sides. But neither Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the\ncoachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of\nthem. \"It seems to be all right,\" Pierre concluded, and followed\nAnna Mikhaylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone\nstaircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow.\nThough he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the\ncount at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet\njudging by Anna Mikhaylovna\'s air of assurance and haste, Pierre\nconcluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the\nstairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying\npails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men\npressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass\nand did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.\n\n\"Is this the way to the princesses\' apartments?\" asked Anna\nMikhaylovna of one of them.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were\nnow permissible; \"the door to the left, ma\'am.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the count did not ask for me,\" said Pierre when he\nreached the landing. \"I\'d better go to my own room.\"\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up.\n\n\"Ah, my friend!\" she said, touching his arm as she had done her\nson\'s when speaking to him that afternoon, \"believe me I suffer no\nless than you do, but be a man!\"\n\n\"But really, hadn\'t I better go away?\" he asked, looking kindly at\nher over his spectacles.\n\n\"Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done\nyou. Think that he is your father... perhaps in the agony of death.\"\nShe sighed. \"I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust\nyourself to me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.\"\n\nPierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this\nhad to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylovna who\nwas already opening a door.\n\nThis door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the\nprincesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been\nin this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of\nthese rooms. Anna Mikhaylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past\nwith a decanter on a tray as \"my dear\" and \"my sweet,\" asked about the\nprincess\' health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The\nfirst door on the left led into the princesses\' apartments. The maid\nwith the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything\nin the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna\nMikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where\nPrince Vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together\ntalking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasili drew back with obvious\nimpatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of\ndesperation slammed the door with all her might.\n\nThis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear\ndepicted on Prince Vasili\'s face so out of keeping with his dignity\nthat Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his\nguide. Anna Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly\nand sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.\n\n\"Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,\" said she in\nreply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.\n\nPierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what\n\"watching over his interests\" meant, but he decided that all these\nthings had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit\nroom adjoining the count\'s reception room. It was one of those\nsumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front\napproach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and\nwater had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a\ncenser and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them.\nThey went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian\nwindows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full\nlength portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still\nsitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one\nanother. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn\nAnna Mikhaylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre\nwho, hanging his head, meekly followed her.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna\'s face expressed a consciousness that the\ndecisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg\nlady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even\nmore boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her\nthe person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured.\nCasting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the\ncount\'s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble,\nnot exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and\nrespectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another\npriest.\n\n\"God be thanked that you are in time,\" said she to one of the\npriests; \"all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man\nis the count\'s son,\" she added more softly. \"What a terrible moment!\"\n\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor.\n\n\"Dear doctor,\" said she, \"this young man is the count\'s son. Is\nthere any hope?\"\n\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his\nshoulders. Anna Mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her\nshoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved\naway from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful\nand tenderly sad voice, she said:\n\n\"Trust in His mercy!\" and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit\nand wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone\nwas watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind\nit.\n\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly,\nmoved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna\nhad disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned\nto him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed\nthat they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him\nwith a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had\nnever before received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had\nbeen talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an\naide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the\ndoctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to\nmake way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as\nnot to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and\nto pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at\nonce he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a\nperson obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone\nexpected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their\nservices. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and\nsat down in the lady\'s chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically\non his knees in the naive attitude of an Egyptian statue, and\ndecided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in\norder not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on\nhis own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the\nwill of those who were guiding him.\n\nNot two minutes had passed before Prince Vasili with head erect\nmajestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three\nstars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the\nmorning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and\nnoticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never\nused to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain\nwhether it was firmly fixed on.\n\n\"Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is\nwell!\" and he turned to go.\n\nBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask: \"How is...\" and hesitated,\nnot knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man \"the\ncount,\" yet ashamed to call him \"father.\"\n\n\"He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my\nfriend...\"\n\nPierre\'s mind was in such a confused state that the word \"stroke\"\nsuggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasili\nin perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of\nillness. Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went\nthrough the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his\nwhole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him,\nand the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the\ndoor. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about,\nand at last Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the same expression, pale but\nresolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly\non the arm said:\n\n\"The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be\nadministered. Come.\"\n\nPierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed\nthat the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all\nfollowed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission\nto enter that room.');

The part of the room behind the\ncolumns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side\nand on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly\nilluminated with red light like a Russian church during evening\nservice. Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in\nthat chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed,\nPierre saw--covered to the waist by a bright green quilt--the\nfamiliar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezukhov, with that\ngray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a\nlion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his\nhandsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick\nhands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm\ndownwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb,\nand an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in\nposition. By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over\ntheir magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their\nhands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little behind\nthem stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their\neyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a\nvicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though\ndeclaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she\nglance round. Anna Mikhaylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and\nall-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the\nstrange lady. Prince Vasili in front of the door, near the invalid\nchair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the\ncarved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and\nwas crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each\ntime he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and\nresignation to the will of God. \"If you do not understand these\nsentiments,\" he seemed to be saying, \"so much the worse for you!\"\n\nBehind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;\nthe men and women had separated as in church. All were silently\ncrossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the\nsubdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and\nthe shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna\nMikhaylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she\nquite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre\nwas standing and gave him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by\nobserving those around him, began crossing himself with the hand\nthat held the taper.\n\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the\nmole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and\nremained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing\nPierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look\nat him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be\nout of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In\nthe midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased,\nthey whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the\ncount\'s hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovna\nstepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to\nLorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he\nwas leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude\nimplying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith,\nunderstood the full importance of the rite now being performed and\neven approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless\nstep of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers\nraised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning\nsideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given\nsomething to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people\nresumed their places and the service continued. During this interval\nPierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had\nbeen leaning, and--with an air which intimated that he knew what he was\nabout and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse\nfor them--did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined\nthe eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room\nwhere stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the\nbed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door, but\nreturned to their places one after the other before the service was\nconcluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to\nthe rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that\nwhat he saw happening around him that evening was in some way\nessential.\n\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest\nwas heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received\nthe sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as\nbefore. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and\nwhispers, among which Anna Mikhaylovna\'s was the most distinct.\n\nPierre heard her say:\n\n\"Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be\nimpossible...\"\n\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and\nservants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face\nwith its gray mane--which, though he saw other faces as well, he had\nnot lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He\njudged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the\ninvalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.\n\n\"Catch hold of my arm or you\'ll drop him!\" he heard one of the\nservants say in a frightened whisper. \"Catch hold from underneath.\nHere!\" exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the\nbearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the\nweight they were carrying were too much for them.\n\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, passed the young\nman he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the\ndying man\'s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders,\nraised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his\ngray, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow\nand cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic\nexpression, was not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the\nsame as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had\nsent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly\nwith the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze\nfixed itself upon nothing.\n\nAfter a few minutes\' bustle beside the high bedstead, those who\nhad carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhaylovna touched\nPierre\'s hand and said, \"Come.\" Pierre went with her to the bed on\nwhich the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the\nceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the\npillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk\nquilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing\nstraight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not\nbe understood by mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that\nas long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too\nmuch. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced\ninquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with\nher eyes, glancing at the sick man\'s hand and moving her lips as if to\nsend it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to\ntouch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the\nlarge boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of\nthe count\'s face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at\nAnna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikhaylovna\nwith her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre\nobediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna\nMikhaylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naively\nsymmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that\nhis stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to\nlook as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed\nat the spot where Pierre\'s face had been before he sat down. Anna\nMikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the\npathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the\nfather and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre\nseemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count\'s\nface began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth\nwas drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death\nhis father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct,\nhoarse sound. Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick man\'s\neyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre,\nthen to some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an inquiring\nwhisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick\nman showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who\nstood constantly at the head of the bed.\n\n\"Wants to turn on the other side,\" whispered the servant, and got up\nto turn the count\'s heavy body toward the wall.\n\nPierre rose to help him.\n\nWhile the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back\nhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward.\nWhether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded\nthat lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his\ndying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre\'s\nterror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a\nfeeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his\nfeatures, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight of this\nsmile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling\nin his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on\nto his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.\n\n\"He is dozing,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna, observing that one of the\nprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching. \"Let us go.\"\n\nPierre went out.');

As soon as they saw Pierre\nand his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the\nprincess hide something as she whispered:\n\n\"I can\'t bear the sight of that woman.\"\n\n\"Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,\" said\nPrince Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna. \"Go and take something, my poor\nAnna Mikhaylovna, or you will not hold out.\"\n\nTo Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic\nsqueeze below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the\nsmall drawing room.\n\n\"There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup\nof this delicious Russian tea,\" Lorrain was saying with an air of\nrestrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese\nhandleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid\nin the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count\nBezukhov\'s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre\nwell remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors\nand little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not\nknow how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the\nladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds\nand pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the\nbrilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several\ntimes. Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one\nsmall table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the\nmiddle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not\nmerrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word\nand movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what\nwas about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though\nhe would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his\nmonitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the\nreception room where they had left Prince Vasili and the eldest\nprincess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a\nshort interval followed her. Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside\nthe princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.\n\n\"Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not\nnecessary,\" said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the\nsame state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.\n\n\"But, my dear princess,\" answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but\nimpressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other\nfrom passing, \"won\'t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment\nwhen he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul\nis already prepared...\"\n\nPrince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar\nattitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which\nwere so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching\nviolently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the\ntwo ladies were saying.\n\n\"Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases.\nYou know how fond the count is of her.\"\n\n\"I don\'t even know what is in this paper,\" said the younger of the\ntwo ladies, addressing Prince Vasili and pointing to an inlaid\nportfolio she held in her hand. \"All I know is that his real will is\nin his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....\"\n\nShe tried to pass Anna Mikhaylovna, but the latter sprang so as to\nbar her path.\n\n\"I know, my dear, kind princess,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna, seizing the\nportfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.\n\"Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je\nvous en conjure...\"\n\nThe princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the\nportfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the\nprincess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna\nMikhaylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost\nnone of its honeyed firmness and softness.\n\n\"Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place\nin a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?\"\n\n\"Why don\'t you speak, cousin?\" suddenly shrieked the princess so\nloud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled.\n\"Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to\ninterfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man\'s room?\nIntriguer!\" she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the\nportfolio.\n\nBut Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold\non the portfolio, and changed her grip.\n\nPrince Vasili rose. \"Oh!\" said he with reproach and surprise,\n\"this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.\"\n\nThe princess let go.\n\n\"And you too!\"\n\nBut Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him.\n\n\"Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will\ngo and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"But, Prince,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna, \"after such a solemn\nsacrament, allow him a moment\'s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your\nopinion,\" said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite\nclose, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the\nprincess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of\nPrince Vasili.\n\n\"Remember that you will answer for the consequences,\" said Prince\nVasili severely. \"You don\'t know what you are doing.\"\n\n\"Vile woman!\" shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna\nMikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.\n\nPrince Vasili bent his head and spread out his hands.\n\nAt this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so\nlong and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and\nbanged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed\nout wringing her hands.\n\n\"What are you doing!\" she cried vehemently. \"He is dying and you\nleave me alone with him!\"\n\nHer sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikhaylovna, stooping,\nquickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom.\nThe eldest princess and Prince Vasili, recovering themselves, followed\nher. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard\nface, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression\nshowed an irrepressible hatred.\n\n\"Yes, now you may be glad!\" said she; \"this is what you have been\nwaiting for.\" And bursting into tears she hid her face in her\nhandkerchief and rushed from the room.\n\nPrince Vasili came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre\nwas sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand.\nPierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as\nif in an ague.\n\n\"Ah, my friend!\" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there\nwas in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in\nit before. \"How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I\nam near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all!\nDeath is awful...\" and he burst into tears.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow,\nquiet steps.\n\n\"Pierre!\" she said.\n\nPierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his\nforehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:\n\n\"He is no more....\"\n\nPierre looked at her over his spectacles.\n\n\"Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as\ntears.\"\n\nShe led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one\ncould see his face. Anna Mikhaylovna left him, and when she returned\nhe was fast asleep with his head on his arm.\n\nIn the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre:\n\n\"Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.\nBut God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in\ncommand of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I\nknow you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but\nit imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.\"\n\nPierre was silent.\n\n\"Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not\nbeen there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle\npromised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Boris. But\nhe had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your\nfather\'s wish?\"\n\nPierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in\nsilence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna\nMikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs\' and went to bed. On waking in the\nmorning she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details\nof Count Bezukhov\'s death. She said the count had died as she would\nherself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but\nedifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so\ntouching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not\nknow which had behaved better during those awful moments--the father\nwho so remembered everything and everybody at last and had\nspoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been\npitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to\nhide it in order not to sadden his dying father. \"It is painful, but\nit does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count\nand his worthy son,\" said she. Of the behavior of the eldest\nprincess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers\nand as a great secret.');

General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andreevich\n(nicknamed in society, \"the King of Prussia\") ever since the Emperor\nPaul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously\nwith his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle\nBourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the\ncapitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that\nanyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow\nto Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to\nsay that there are only two sources of human vice--idleness and\nsuperstition, and only two virtues--activity and intelligence. He\nhimself undertook his daughter\'s education, and to develop these two\ncardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till\nshe was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was\noccupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving\nproblems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working\nin the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on\nat his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating\nactivity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point\nof exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same\nconditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With\nthose about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp\nand invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he\ninspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have\naroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in\npolitical affairs, every high official appointed to the province in\nwhich the prince\'s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and\nwaited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or\nPrincess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the\nappointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the\nsame feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study\ndoor opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with\npowdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which,\nwhen he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully\nglittering eyes.\n\nOn the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive,\nPrincess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed\nfor the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and\nrepeating a silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and\nevery morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.\n\nAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose\nquietly and said in a whisper: \"Please walk in.\"\n\nThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess\ntimidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused\nat the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after\nglancing round continued his work.\n\nThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The\nlarge table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted\nbookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while\nstanding up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with\ntools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around--all\nindicated continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of\nthe small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and\nthe firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince\nstill possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age.\nAfter a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the\npedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to\nthe lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never\ngave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly\ncheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively,\nsaid severely:\n\n\"Quite well? All right then, sit down.\" He took the exercise book\ncontaining lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a\nchair with his foot.\n\n\"For tomorrow!\" said he, quickly finding the page and making a\nscratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.\n\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on the table.\n\n\"Wait a bit, here\'s a letter for you,\" said the old man suddenly,\ntaking a letter addressed in a woman\'s hand from a bag hanging above\nthe table, onto which he threw it.\n\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the\nprincess\' face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.\n\n\"From Heloise?\" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his\nstill sound, yellowish teeth.\n\n\"Yes, it\'s from Julie,\" replied the princess with a timid glance and\na timid smile.\n\n\"I\'ll let two more letters pass, but the third I\'ll read,\" said\nthe prince sternly; \"I\'m afraid you write much nonsense. I\'ll read the\nthird!\"\n\n\"Read this if you like, Father,\" said the princess, blushing still\nmore and holding out the letter.\n\n\"The third, I said the third!\" cried the prince abruptly, pushing\nthe letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward\nhim the exercise book containing geometrical figures.\n\n\"Well, madam,\" he began, stooping over the book close to his\ndaughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,\nso that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of\nold age and tobacco, which she had known so long. \"Now, madam, these\ntriangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...\"\n\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her father\'s eyes\nglittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went,\nand it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened\nthat her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father\'s\nfurther explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was\nthe teacher\'s fault or the pupil\'s, this same thing happened every\nday: the princess\' eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear\nanything, but was only conscious of her stern father\'s withered face\nclose to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only\nof how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem\nin peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which\nhe was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control\nhimself and not become vehement, but almost always did become\nvehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.\n\nThe princess gave a wrong answer.\n\n\"Well now, isn\'t she a fool!\" shouted the prince, pushing the book\naside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up\nand down, lightly touched his daughter\'s hair and sat down again.\n\nHe drew up his chair, and continued to explain.\n\n\"This won\'t do, Princess; it won\'t do,\" said he, when Princess Mary,\nhaving taken and closed the exercise book with the next day\'s\nlesson, was about to leave: \"Mathematics are most important, madam!\nI don\'t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and\nyou\'ll like it,\" and he patted her cheek. \"It will drive all the\nnonsense out of your head.\"\n\nShe turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an\nuncut book from the high desk.\n\n\"Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Heloise has\nsent you. Religious! I don\'t interfere with anyone\'s belief... I\nhave looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.\"\n\nHe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.\n\nPrincess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared\nexpression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly\nface yet plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood\nminiature portraits and which was littered with books and papers.\nThe princess was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down the\ngeometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter. It was from\nher most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karagina\nwho had been at the Rostovs\' name-day party.\n\nJulie wrote in French:\n\n\nDear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is\nseparation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my\nhappiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance\nseparating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart\nrebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions\naround me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in\nmy heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were last\nsummer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa?\nWhy cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength\nfrom your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so\nwell and seem to see before me as I write?\n\n\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the\nmirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful\nfigure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular\nhopelessness at her reflection in the glass. \"She flatters me,\"\nthought the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie\ndid not flatter her friend, the princess\' eyes--large, deep and\nluminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts\nof warm light)--were so beautiful that very often in spite of the\nplainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than\nthat of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of\nher own eyes--the look they had when she was not thinking of\nherself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural\nexpression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading:\n\n\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is\nalready abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on\ntheir march to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg\nand it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances\nof war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the\npeace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the\nAlmighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing\nof my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations\nnearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostov, who with his\nenthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the\nuniversity to join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in\nspite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great\ngrief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so\nnoble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds\nnowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank\nand has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with\nhim, transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to\nmy poor heart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell\nyou about our parting and all that was said then. That is still too\nfresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant\njoys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally\nthe stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever\nto be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic\nand pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of this!\nThe chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old\nCount Bezukhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses\nhave received very little, Prince Vasili nothing, and it is Monsieur\nPierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been\nrecognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezukhov and\npossessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince\nVasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that he\nreturned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.\n\nI confess I understand very little about all these matters of\nwills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom\nwe all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count\nBezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I\nam much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the\nmammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies\nthemselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed\nto me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have\namused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don\'t\neven know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as\nthe future Countess Bezukhova. But you will understand that I have\nno desire for the post. A propos of marriages: do you know that a\nwhile ago that universal auntie Anna Mikhaylovna told me, under the\nseal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neither\nmore nor less than with Prince Vasili\'s son Anatole, whom they wish to\nreform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee, and it is on\nyou that his relations\' choice has fallen. I don\'t know what you\nwill think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it.\nHe is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is\nall I have been able to find out about him.\n\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper,\nand Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apraksins\'. Read the\nmystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here.\nThough there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to\ngrasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul.\nAdieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments\nto Mademoiselle Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.\n\nJULIE\n\nP.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.\n\n\nThe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her\nluminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then\nshe suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She\ntook a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is\nthe reply she wrote, also in French:\n\n\nDear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great\ndelight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which\nyou say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual\neffect on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say,\nif I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me?\nAh, if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why\ndo you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for\nthat young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I\nunderstand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I\ncannot approve of them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me\nthat Christian love, love of one\'s neighbor, love of one\'s enemy, is\nworthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful\neyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl\nlike yourself.\n\nThe news of Count Bezukhov\'s death reached us before your letter and\nmy father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last\nrepresentative but one of the great century, and that it is his own\nturn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as\nlate as possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!\n\nI cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He\nalways seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the\nquality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part\nplayed by Prince Vasili, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear\nfriend, our divine Saviour\'s words, that it is easier for a camel to\ngo through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the\nKingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasili but am still\nmore sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches--to\nwhat temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire\nmost on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar. A\nthousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and\nwhich has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that among\nsome good things it contains others which our weak human understanding\ncannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading\nwhat is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never\ncould understand the fondness some people have for confusing their\nminds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts\nand excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration\nquite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the\nEpistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they\ncontain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the\nterrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this\nflesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let\nus rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which\nour divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to\nconform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less\nwe let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God,\nwho rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we\nseek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner\nwill He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.\n\nMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me\nthat he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince\nVasili. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you,\ndear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution\nto which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should\nthe Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I\nshall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without\ndisquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may\ngive me for husband.\n\nI have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy\narrival at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief\none, however, for he will leave, us again to take part in this unhappy\nwar into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only\nwhere you are--at the heart of affairs and of the world--is the talk\nall of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature--which\ntownsfolk consider characteristic of the country--rumors of war are\nheard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and\ncountermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day\nbefore yesterday during my daily walk through the village I\nwitnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts\nenrolled from our people and starting to join the army. You should\nhave seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who\nwere going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as though\nmankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached\nlove and forgiveness of injuries--and that men attribute the\ngreatest merit to skill in killing one another.\n\nAdieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most\nHoly Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!\n\nMARY\n\n\n\"Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already\ndispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother,\" said the smiling\nMademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and\nwith guttural r\'s. She brought into Princess Mary\'s strenuous,\nmournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless,\nlighthearted, and self-satisfied.\n\n\"Princess, I must warn you,\" she added, lowering her voice and\nevidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with\nexaggerated grasseyement, \"the prince has been scolding Michael\nIvanovich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.\"\n\n\"Ah, dear friend,\" replied Princess Mary, \"I have asked you never to\nwarn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge\nhim and would not have others do so.\"\n\nThe princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five\nminutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the\nsitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o\'clock,\nas the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played\nthe clavichord.');

From the far side\nof the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult\npassages--twenty times repeated--of a sonata by Dussek.\n\nJust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to\nthe porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little\nwife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old\nTikhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the\nantechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and\nhastily closed the door. Tikhon knew that neither the son\'s arrival\nnor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed\norder of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as\nTikhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father\'s\nhabits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured\nhimself that they had not, he turned to his wife.\n\n\"He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary\'s room,\"\nhe said.\n\nThe little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes\nand her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak\njust as merrily and prettily as ever.\n\n\"Why, this is a palace!\" she said to her husband, looking around\nwith the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.\n\"Let\'s come, quick, quick!\" And with a glance round, she smiled at\nTikhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.\n\n\"Is that Mary practicing? Let\'s go quietly and take her by\nsurprise.\"\n\nPrince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.\n\n\"You\'ve grown older, Tikhon,\" he said in passing to the old man, who\nkissed his hand.\n\nBefore they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord\ncame, the pretty, fair haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nrushed out apparently beside herself with delight.\n\n\"Ah! what joy for the princess!\" exclaimed she: \"At last! I must let\nher know.\"\n\n\"No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,\" said the\nlittle princess, kissing her. \"I know you already through my\nsister-in-law\'s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?\"\n\nThey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the\nsound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped\nand made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.\n\nThe little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the\nmiddle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary\'s heavy tread and the\nsound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who\nhad only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each\nother\'s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they\nhappened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her\nhand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready\nto cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and\nfrowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two\nwomen let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late,\nseized each other\'s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and\nagain began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince\nAndrew\'s surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle\nBourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease,\nbut to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and\napparently it never entered their heads that it could have been\notherwise at this meeting.\n\n\"Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!\" they suddenly exclaimed, and then\nlaughed. \"I dreamed last night...\"--\"You were not expecting us?...\"\n\"Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...\" \"And you have grown stouter!...\"\n\n\"I knew the princess at once,\" put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\"And I had no idea!...\" exclaimed Princess Mary. \"Ah, Andrew, I\ndid not see you.\"\n\nPrince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another,\nand he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess\nMary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the\nloving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful\nat that moment, rested on Prince Andrew\'s face.\n\nThe little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip\ncontinually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary\nand drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of\nglittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they\nhad had on the Spasski Hill which might have been serious for her in\nher condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had\nleft all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would\nhave to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that\nKitty Odyntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor\nfor Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess\nMary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful\neyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was\nfollowing a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law\'s words.\nIn the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she\naddressed her brother:\n\n\"So you are really going to the war, Andrew?\" she said sighing.\n\nLise sighed too.\n\n\"Yes, and even tomorrow,\" replied her brother.\n\n\"He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had\npromotion...\"\n\nPrincess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of\nthought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her\nfigure.\n\n\"Is it certain?\" she said.\n\nThe face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said:\n\"Yes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...\"\n\nHer lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law\'s\nand unexpectedly again began to cry.\n\n\"She needs rest,\" said Prince Andrew with a frown. \"Don\'t you, Lise?\nTake her to your room and I\'ll go to Father. How is he? Just the\nsame?\"\n\n\"Yes, just the same. Though I don\'t know what your opinion will be,\"\nanswered the princess joyfully.\n\n\"And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the\nlathe?\" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which\nshowed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he\nwas aware of his weaknesses.\n\n\"The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and\nmy geometry lessons,\" said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her\nlessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.\n\nWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the\nold prince to get up, Tikhon came to call the young prince to his\nfather. The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor\nof his son\'s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments\nwhile he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in\nold-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and\nwhen Prince Andrew entered his father\'s dressing room (not with the\ncontemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the\nanimated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting\non a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle,\nentrusting his head to Tikhon.\n\n\"Ah! here\'s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?\" said the old\nman, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tikhon was\nholding fast to plait, would allow.\n\n\"You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like\nthis he\'ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?\" And he\nheld out his cheek.\n\nThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He\nused to say that a nap \"after dinner was silver--before dinner,\ngolden.\") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his\nthick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father\non the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father\'s\nfavorite topic--making fun of the military men of the day, and more\nparticularly of Bonaparte.\n\n\"Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,\"\nsaid Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father\'s face with\nan eager and respectful look. \"How is your health?\"\n\n\"Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy\nfrom morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" said his son smiling.\n\n\"God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,\" he continued,\nreturning to his hobby; \"tell me how the Germans have taught you to\nfight Bonaparte by this new science you call \'strategy.\'\"\n\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\n\"Give me time to collect my wits, Father,\" said he, with a smile\nthat showed that his father\'s foibles did not prevent his son from\nloving and honoring him. \"Why, I have not yet had time to settle\ndown!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to\nsee whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand.\n\"The house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there\nand show her over, and they\'ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That\'s\ntheir woman\'s way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About\nMikhelson\'s army I understand--Tolstoy\'s too... a simultaneous\nexpedition.... But what\'s the southern army to do? Prussia is\nneutral... I know that. What about Austria?\" said he, rising from\nhis chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tikhon, who\nran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. \"What of\nSweden? How will they cross Pomerania?\"\n\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began--at first\nreluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from\nhabit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on--to\nexplain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained\nhow an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to\nbring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of\nthat army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two\nhundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand\nRussians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty\nthousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how\na total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French\nfrom different sides. The old prince did not evince the least interest\nduring this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it\ncontinued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly\ninterrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: \"The white one, the white\none!\"\n\nThis meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he\nwanted. Another time he interrupted, saying:\n\n\"And will she soon be confined?\" and shaking his head\nreproachfully said: \"That\'s bad! Go on, go on.\"\n\nThe third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his\ndescription. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old\nage: \"Malbrook s\'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.\"*\n\n\n*\"Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he\'ll return.\"\n\n\nHis son only smiled.\n\n\"I don\'t say it\'s a plan I approve of,\" said the son; \"I am only\ntelling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,\nnot worse than this one.\"\n\n\"Well, you\'ve told me nothing new,\" and the old man repeated,\nmeditatively and rapidly:\n\n\"Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.\"');

The prince, who\ngenerally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely\nadmitted even important government officials to his table, had\nunexpectedly selected Michael Ivanovich (who always went into a corner\nto blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory\nthat all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his\ndaughter that Michael Ivanovich was \"not a whit worse than you or\nI.\" At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael\nIvanovich more often than to anyone else.\n\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was\nexceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen--one\nbehind each chair--stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head\nbutler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making\nsigns to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the\ndoor by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at\na large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of\nthe Princes Bolkonski, opposite which hung another such frame with a\nbadly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist\nbelonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown--an alleged\ndescendant of Rurik and ancestor of the Bolkonskis. Prince Andrew,\nlooking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a\nman laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original\nas to be amusing.\n\n\"How thoroughly like him that is!\" he said to Princess Mary, who had\ncome up to him.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not\nunderstand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired\nher with reverence and was beyond question.\n\n\"Everyone has his Achilles\' heel,\" continued Prince Andrew.\n\"Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!\"\n\nPrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother\'s\ncriticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were\nheard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily\nas was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of\nhis manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the\ngreat clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from\nthe drawing room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes\nfrom under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and\nrested on the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar\nenters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired\nin all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly\non the back of her neck.\n\n\"I\'m glad, glad, to see you,\" he said, looking attentively into\nher eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. \"Sit\ndown, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ianovich!\"\n\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman\nmoved the chair for her.\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded\nfigure. \"You\'ve been in a hurry. That\'s bad!\"\n\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips\nonly and not with his eyes.\n\n\"You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She\nwas silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father,\nand she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances,\nand she became still more animated and chattered away giving him\ngreetings from various people and retailing the town gossip.\n\n\"Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has\ncried her eyes out,\" she said, growing more and more lively.\n\nAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more\nsternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had\nformed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael\nIvanovich.\n\n\"Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of\nit. Prince Andrew\" (he always spoke thus of his son) \"has been telling\nme what forces are being collected against him! While you and I\nnever thought much of him.\"\n\nMichael Ivanovich did not at all know when \"you and I\" had said such\nthings about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a\npeg on which to hang the prince\'s favorite topic, he looked\ninquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.\n\n\"He is a great tactician!\" said the prince to his son, pointing to\nthe architect.\n\nAnd the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and\nthe generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced\nnot only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know\nthe A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an\ninsignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no\nlonger any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him; but he was also\nconvinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no\nreal war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day\nwere playing, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily\nbore with his father\'s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and\nlistened to him with evident pleasure.\n\n\"The past always seems good,\" said he, \"but did not Suvorov\nhimself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not\nknow how to escape?\"\n\n\"Who told you that? Who?\" cried the prince. \"Suvorov!\" And he jerked\naway his plate, which Tikhon briskly caught. \"Suvorov!... Consider,\nPrince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvorov; Moreau!... Moreau would\nhave been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand; but he had the\nHofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled\nthe devil himself! When you get there you\'ll find out what those\nHofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvorov couldn\'t manage them so what\nchance has Michael Kutuzov? No, my dear boy,\" he continued, \"you and\nyour generals won\'t get on against Buonaparte; you\'ll have to call\nin the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The\nGerman, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the\nFrenchman, Moreau,\" he said, alluding to the invitation made that year\nto Moreau to enter the Russian service.... \"Wonderful!... Were the\nPotemkins, Suvorovs, and Orlovs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows\nhave all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you,\nbut we\'ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great\ncommander among them! Hm!...\"\n\n\"I don\'t at all say that all the plans are good,\" said Prince\nAndrew, \"I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may\nlaugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great\ngeneral!\"\n\n\"Michael Ivanovich!\" cried the old prince to the architect who, busy\nwith his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: \"Didn\'t I tell you\nBuonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.\"\n\n\"To be sure, your excellency,\" replied the architect.\n\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\n\"Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got\nsplendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only\nidlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began\neverybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no one--except one\nanother. He made his reputation fighting them.\"\n\nAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to\nhim, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son\nmade no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were\npresented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion.\nHe listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how\nthis old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could\nknow and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European\nmilitary and political events.\n\n\"You think I\'m an old man and don\'t understand the present state\nof affairs?\" concluded his father. \"But it troubles me. I don\'t\nsleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours\nshown his skill?\" he concluded.\n\n\"That would take too long to tell,\" answered the son.\n\n\"Well, then go to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here\'s\nanother admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,\" he\nexclaimed in excellent French.\n\n\"You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!\"\n\n\"Dieu sait quand reviendra...\" hummed the prince out of tune and,\nwith a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.\n\nThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of\nthe dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her\nfather-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she\ntook her sister-in-law\'s arm and drew her into another room.\n\n\"What a clever man your father is,\" said she; \"perhaps that is why I\nam afraid of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, he is so kind!\" answered Princess Mary.');

The old prince, not\naltering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little\nprincess was in her sister-in-law\'s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling\ncoat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms\nassigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing\nthe trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those\nthings he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a\nlarge canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a\nsaber--a present from his father who had brought it from the siege\nof Ochakov. All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew\'s were in\nvery good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with\ntapes.\n\nWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men\ncapable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At\nsuch moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince\nAndrew\'s face looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind\nhim he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking\nstraight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear\ngoing to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?--perhaps both,\nbut evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing\nfootsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped\nat a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his\nusual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy tread\nof Princess Mary that he heard.\n\n\"I hear you have given orders to harness,\" she cried, panting (she\nhad apparently been running), \"and I did so wish to have another\ntalk with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You\nare not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrusha,\"\nshe added, as if to explain such a question.\n\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, \"Andrusha.\" It was obviously\nstrange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be\nAndrusha--the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in\nchildhood.\n\n\"And where is Lise?\" he asked, answering her question only by a\nsmile.\n\n\"She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.\nOh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,\" said she, sitting\ndown on the sofa, facing her brother. \"She is quite a child: such a\ndear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.\"\n\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical\nand contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n\n\"One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,\nAndrew? Don\'t forget that she has grown up and been educated in\nsociety, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter\ninto everyone\'s situation. Tout comprendre, c\'est tout pardonner.*\nThink what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been\nused to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the\ncountry, in her condition! It\'s very hard.\"\n\n\n*To understand all is to forgive all.\n\n\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at\nthose we think we thoroughly understand.\n\n\"You live in the country and don\'t think the life terrible,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"I... that\'s different. Why speak of me? I don\'t want any other\nlife, and can\'t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young\nsociety woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her\nlife, all alone--for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what\npoor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best\nsociety. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....\"\n\n\"I don\'t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,\" said Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\"No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she\'s much to be\npitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don\'t need her,\nand she\'s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am\neven more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She\nand Michael Ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle\nand kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne\nsays: \'We don\'t love people so much for the good they have done us, as\nfor the good we have done them.\' Father took her when she was homeless\nafter losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father\nlikes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads\nsplendidly.\"\n\n\"To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father\'s character sometimes\nmakes things trying for you, doesn\'t it?\" Prince Andrew asked\nsuddenly.\n\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n\n\"For me? For me?... Trying for me!...\" said she.\n\n\"He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he\'s getting\nvery trying,\" said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their\nfather in order to puzzle or test his sister.\n\n\"You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of\nintellectual pride,\" said the princess, following the train of her own\nthoughts rather than the trend of the conversation--\"and that\'s a\ngreat sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what\nfeeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I\nam so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as\nhappy as I am.\"\n\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n\n\"The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,\nAndrew... is Father\'s way of treating religious subjects. I don\'t\nunderstand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what\nis as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing\nthat makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of\nimprovement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was\na monk he received and had a long talk with.\"\n\n\"Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your\npowder,\" said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n\n\"Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.\nAndrew...\" she said timidly after a moment\'s silence, \"I have a\ngreat favor to ask of you.\"\n\n\"What is it, dear?\"\n\n\"No--promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble\nand is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,\nAndrusha!...\" said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet\ntaking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were\nthe subject of her request and must not be shown before the request\nwas granted.\n\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n\n\"Even if it were a great deal of trouble...\" answered Prince Andrew,\nas if guessing what it was about.\n\n\"Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as\nyou please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father\'s father, our\ngrandfather, wore it in all his wars.\" (She still did not take out\nwhat she was holding in her reticule.) \"So you promise?\"\n\n\"Of course. What is it?\"\n\n\"Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will\nnever take it off. Do you promise?\"\n\n\"If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won\'t break my neck...\nTo please you...\" said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the\npained expression his joke had brought to his sister\'s face, he\nrepented and added: \"I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.\"\n\n\"Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring\nyou to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,\" said she in a\nvoice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before\nher brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour\nin a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.\n\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n\n\"Please, Andrew, for my sake!...\"\n\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes\nlit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her\nbrother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew\nunderstood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of\ntenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear.\" She kissed him on the forehead and sat down\nagain on the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n\n\"As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you\nalways used to be. Don\'t judge Lise harshly,\" she began. \"She is so\nsweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.\"\n\n\"I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Masha, or\nblamed her. Why do you say all this to me?\"\n\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary\'s face and she was silent as\nif she felt guilty.\n\n\"I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to.\nAnd I am sorry for that,\" he went on.\n\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried\nto say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the\nlittle princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her\nforebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had\ncomplained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After\ncrying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n\n\"Know this, Masha: I can\'t reproach, have not reproached, and\nnever shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach\nmyself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in\nwhatever circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the\ntruth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No!\nBut why this is so I don\'t know...\"\n\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed\nher forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and\nunaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over\nher head toward the darkness of the open doorway.\n\n\"Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or--go and wake and I\'ll come\nin a moment. Petrushka!\" he called to his valet: \"Come here, take\nthese away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.\"\n\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:\n\"Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him\nto give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have\nbeen answered.\"\n\n\"Well, may be!\" said Prince Andrew. \"Go, Masha; I\'ll come\nimmediately.\"\n\nOn the way to his sister\'s room, in the passage which connected\none wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne\nsmiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic\nand artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.\n\n\"Oh! I thought you were in your room,\" she said, for some reason\nblushing and dropping her eyes.\n\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger\nsuddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at\nher forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt\nthat the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he\nreached his sister\'s room his wife was already awake and her merry\nvoice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door.\nShe was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long\nself-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.\n\n\"No, but imagine the old Countess Zubova, with false curls and her\nmouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old\nage.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!\"\n\nThis very sentence about Countess Zubova and this same laugh\nPrince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of\nothers some five times. He entered the room softly. The little\nprincess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work\nin her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg\nreminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her\nhair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey. She answered\nhim and continued her chatter.\n\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn\nnight, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.\nServants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense\nhouse was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The\ndomestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to\nthe young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in\nthe reception hall: Michael Ivanovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nPrincess Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been\ncalled to his father\'s study as the latter wished to say good-by to\nhim alone. All were waiting for them to come out.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age\nspectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but\nhis son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.\n\n\"Going?\" And he went on writing.\n\n\"I\'ve come to say good-by.\"\n\n\"Kiss me here,\" and he touched his cheek: \"Thanks, thanks!\"\n\n\"What do you thank me for?\"\n\n\"For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman\'s apron\nstrings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!\" And he went\non writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. \"If you have\nanything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your\nhands...\"\n\n\"Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.\"\n\n\"When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur....\nLet him be here....\"\n\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed\nhis stern eyes on his son.\n\n\"I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,\" said\nPrince Andrew, evidently confused. \"I know that out of a million cases\nonly one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been\ntelling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.\"\n\n\"Hm... Hm...\" muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what\nhe was writing. \"I\'ll do it.\"\n\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to\nlaugh.\n\n\"It\'s a bad business, eh?\"\n\n\"What is bad, Father?\"\n\n\"The wife!\" said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n\n\"I don\'t understand!\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"No, it can\'t be helped, lad,\" said the prince. \"They\'re all like\nthat; one can\'t unmarry. Don\'t be afraid; I won\'t tell anyone, but you\nknow it yourself.\"\n\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it,\nlooked straight into his son\'s face with keen eyes which seemed to see\nthrough him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him.\nThe old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and\nthrowing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed\nrapidity.\n\n\"What\'s to be done? She\'s pretty! I will do everything. Make your\nmind easy,\" said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.\n\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his\nfather understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his\nson.\n\n\"Listen!\" said he; \"don\'t worry about your wife: what can be done\nshall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovich.* I\nhave written that he should make use of you in proper places and not\nkeep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember\nand like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all\nright--serve him. Nicholas Bolkonski\'s son need not serve under anyone\nif he is in disfavor. Now come here.\"\n\n\n*Kutuzov.\n\n\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his\nson was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised\nthe lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled\nwith his bold, tall, close handwriting.\n\n\"I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;\nhand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond\nand a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of\nSuvorov\'s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you\nto read when I am gone. You will find them useful.\"\n\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long\ntime yet. He felt that he must not say it.\n\n\"I will do it all, Father,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, now, good-by!\" He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced\nhim. \"Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt\nme, your old father...\" he paused unexpectedly, and then in a\nquerulous voice suddenly shrieked: \"but if I hear that you have not\nbehaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!\"\n\n\"You need not have said that to me, Father,\" said the son with a\nsmile.\n\nThe old man was silent.\n\n\"I also wanted to ask you,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"if I\'m killed\nand if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you--as I said\nyesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.\"\n\n\"Not let the wife have him?\" said the old man, and laughed.\n\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The old man\'s sharp eyes were\nfixed straight on his son\'s. Something twitched in the lower part of\nthe old prince\'s face.\n\n\"We\'ve said good-by. Go!\" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry\nvoice, opening his door.\n\n\"What is it? What?\" asked both princesses when they saw for a moment\nat the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white\ndressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply.\n\n\"Well!\" he said, turning to his wife.\n\nAnd this \"Well!\" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying,:\n\"Now go through your performance.\"\n\n\"Andrew, already!\" said the little princess, turning pale and\nlooking with dismay at her husband.\n\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.\n\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her\nface, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.\n\n\"Adieu, Mary,\" said he gently to his sister, taking her by the\nhand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.\n\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne\nchafing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law,\nstill looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through\nwhich Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his\ndirection. From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent\nsound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince\nAndrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of\nthe old man in the white dressing gown looked out.\n\n\"Gone? That\'s all right!\" said he; and looking angrily at the\nunconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed\nthe door.');

Braunau was the\nheadquarters of the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov.\n\nOn October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just\nreached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be\ninspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance\nof the locality and surroundings--fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled\nroofs, and hills in the distance--and despite the fact that the\ninhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not\nRussians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment\npreparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.\n\nOn the evening of the last day\'s march an order had been received\nthat the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march.\nThough the words of the order were not clear to the regimental\ncommander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in\nmarching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the\nbattalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the\nprinciple that it is always better to \"bow too low than not bow low\nenough.\" So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending\nand cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the\nadjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by\nmorning the regiment--instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it\nhad been on its last march the day before--presented a well-ordered\narray of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty,\nhad every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness.\nAnd not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the\ncommander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on\nevery man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of\narticles, \"awl, soap, and all,\" as the soldiers say. There was only\none circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was\nthe state of the soldiers\' boots. More than half the men\'s boots\nwere in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the\nregimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not\nbeen issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched\nsome seven hundred miles.\n\nThe commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and\nthick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider\nfrom chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new\nuniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold\nepaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive\nshoulders. He had the air of a man happily performing one of the\nmost solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line\nand at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was\nplain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and\nthat his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to\nindicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair\nsex occupied no small part of his thoughts.\n\n\"Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?\" he said, addressing one of the\nbattalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain\nthat they both felt happy). \"We had our hands full last night.\nHowever, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?\"\n\nThe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.\n\n\"It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsaritsin Meadow.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked the commander.\n\nAt that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had\nbeen posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an\naide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.\n\nThe aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been\nclearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief\nwished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on\nthe march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation\nwhatever.\n\nA member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov the\nday before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army\nof the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, not considering\nthis junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of\nhis view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the\ntroops arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the\nregiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the\ncommander in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know\nthese circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that\nthe men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and\nthat the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On\nhearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged\nhis shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.\n\n\"A fine mess we\'ve made of it!\" he remarked.\n\n\"There now! Didn\'t I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if it was\nsaid \'on the march\' it meant in greatcoats?\" said he reproachfully\nto the battalion commander. \"Oh, my God!\" he added, stepping\nresolutely forward. \"Company commanders!\" he shouted in a voice\naccustomed to command. \"Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?\"\nhe asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently\nrelating to the personage he was referring to.\n\n\"In an hour\'s time, I should say.\"\n\n\"Shall we have time to change clothes?\"\n\n\"I don\'t know, General....\"\n\nThe regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered\nthe soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders\nran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the\ngreatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares\nthat had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and\nstretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and\nfro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and\npulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and\ndrawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.\n\nIn half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had\nbecome gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his\njerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a\ndistance.\n\n\"Whatever is this? This!\" he shouted and stood still. \"Commander\nof the third company!\"\n\n\"Commander of the third company wanted by the general!...\ncommander to the general... third company to the commander.\" The words\npassed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing\nofficer.\n\nWhen the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination\nin a cry of: \"The general to the third company,\" the missing officer\nappeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged\nman and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on\nhis toes toward the general. The captain\'s face showed the\nuneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not\nlearned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was\nevidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The\ngeneral looked the captain up and down as he came up panting,\nslackening his pace as he approached.\n\n\"You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?\"\nshouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and\npointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat\nof bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. \"What have you been\nafter? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place?\nEh? I\'ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade....\nEh...?\"\n\nThe commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,\npressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this\npressure lay his only hope of salvation.\n\n\"Well, why don\'t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as\na Hungarian?\" said the commander with an austere gibe.\n\n\"Your excellency...\"\n\n\"Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your\nexcellency?... nobody knows.\"\n\n\"Your excellency, it\'s the officer Dolokhov, who has been reduced to\nthe ranks,\" said the captain softly.\n\n\"Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?\nIf a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the\nothers.\"\n\n\"Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.\"\n\n\"Gave him leave? Leave? That\'s just like you young men,\" said the\nregimental commander cooling down a little. \"Leave indeed.... One says\na word to you and you... What?\" he added with renewed irritation, \"I\nbeg you to dress your men decently.\"\n\nAnd the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his\njerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display\nof anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further\nexcuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished\nbadge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the\nthird company.\n\n\"H-o-o-w are you standing? Where\'s your leg? Your leg?\" shouted\nthe commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there\nwere still five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray\nuniform.\n\nDolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with\nhis clear, insolent eyes in the general\'s face.\n\n\"Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his\ncoat... the ras...\" he did not finish.\n\n\"General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...\"\nDolokhov hurriedly interrupted.\n\n\"No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!\"\n\n\"Not bound to endure insults,\" Dolokhov concluded in loud, ringing\ntones.\n\nThe eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became\nsilent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.\n\n\"I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,\" he said as\nhe turned away.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK TWO: 1805: CHAPTER II','\"He\'s coming!\" shouted the signaler at that moment.\n\nThe regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the\nstirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle,\nrighted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute\ncountenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment\nfluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless.\n\n\"Att-ention!\" shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking\nvoice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment,\nand welcome for the approaching chief.\n\nAlong the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a\nhigh, light blue Viennese caleche, slightly creaking on its springs\nand drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the caleche galloped\nthe suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian\ngeneral, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian\nblack ones. The caleche stopped in front of the regiment. Kutuzov\nand the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutuzov smiled\nslightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as\nif those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the\nregimental commander did not exist.\n\nThe word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as\nwith a jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence\nthe feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment\nroared, \"Health to your ex... len... len... lency!\" and again all\nbecame silent. At first Kutuzov stood still while the regiment\nmoved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite,\nwalked between the ranks.\n\nFrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief\nand devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and\nfrom the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals,\nbending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and\nfrom the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the\ncommander in chief, it was evident that he performed his duty as a\nsubordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander.\nThanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the\nregiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the\nsame time, was in splendid condition. There were only 217 sick and\nstragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots.\n\nKutuzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few\nfriendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war,\nsometimes also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several\ntimes shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian\ngeneral with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming\nanyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was.\nThe regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to\nmiss a single word of the commander in chief\'s regarding the regiment.\nBehind Kutuzov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to\nbe heard, followed some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen\ntalked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the\ncommander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was Prince\nBolkonski. Beside him was his comrade Nesvitski, a tall staff officer,\nextremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes.\nNesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar\nofficer who walked beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and\nwithout a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes,\nwatched the regimental commander\'s back and mimicked his every\nmovement. Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar\nstarted and bent forward in exactly the same manner. Nesvitski laughed\nand nudged the others to make them look at the wag.\n\nKutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which\nwere starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the\nthird company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected\nthis, involuntarily came closer to him.\n\n\"Ah, Timokhin!\" said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had\nbeen reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.\n\nOne would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself\nmore than Timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the\nregimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed\nhim he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not\nhave sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him,\nand so Kutuzov, who evidently understood his case and wished him\nnothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile\nflitting over his scarred and puffy face.\n\n\"Another Ismail comrade,\" said he. \"A brave officer! Are you\nsatisfied with him?\" he asked the regimental commander.\n\nAnd the latter--unconscious that he was being reflected in the\nhussar officer as in a looking glass--started, moved forward, and\nanswered: \"Highly satisfied, your excellency!\"\n\n\"We all have our weaknesses,\" said Kutuzov smiling and walking\naway from him. \"He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.\"\n\nThe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this\nand did not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of\nthe red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his\nexpression and pose with such exactitude that Nesvitski could not help\nlaughing. Kutuzov turned round. The officer evidently had complete\ncontrol of his face, and while Kutuzov was turning managed to make a\ngrimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent\nexpression.\n\nThe third company was the last, and Kutuzov pondered, apparently\ntrying to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from\namong the suite and said in French:\n\n\"You told me to remind you of the officer Dolokhov, reduced to the\nranks in this regiment.\"\n\n\"Where is Dolokhov?\" asked Kutuzov.\n\nDolokhov, who had already changed into a soldier\'s gray greatcoat,\ndid not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired\nsoldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks,\nwent up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.\n\n\"Have you a complaint to make?\" Kutuzov asked with a slight frown.\n\n\"This is Dolokhov,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Kutuzov. \"I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your\nduty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan\'t forget you if you\ndeserve well.\"\n\nThe clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as\nboldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by\ntheir expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates\na commander in chief so widely from a private.\n\n\"One thing I ask of your excellency,\" Dolokhov said in his firm,\nringing, deliberate voice. \"I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault\nand prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!\"\n\nKutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had\nturned from Captain Timokhin again flitted over his face. He turned\naway with a grimace as if to say that everything Dolokhov had said\nto him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he\nwas weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away\nand went to the carriage.\n\nThe regiment broke up into companies, which went to their\nappointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and\nclothes and to rest after their hard marches.\n\n\"You won\'t bear me a grudge, Prokhor Ignatych?\" said the\nregimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its\nquarters and riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front.\n(The regimental commander\'s face now that the inspection was happily\nover beamed with irrepressible delight.) \"It\'s in the Emperor\'s\nservice... it can\'t be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on\nparade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very\npleased!\" And he held out his hand to the captain.\n\n\"Don\'t mention it, General, as if I\'d be so bold!\" replied the\ncaptain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where\ntwo front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end\nof a gun at Ismail.\n\n\"And tell Mr. Dolokhov that I won\'t forget him--he may be quite easy.\nAnd tell me, please--I\'ve been meaning to ask--how is he behaving\nhimself, and in general...\"\n\n\"As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your\nexcellency; but his character...\" said Timokhin.\n\n\"And what about his character?\" asked the regimental commander.\n\n\"It\'s different on different days,\" answered the captain. \"One day\nhe is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he\'s a\nwild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, well!\" remarked the regimental commander. \"Still, one\nmust have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important\nconnections... Well, then, you just...\"\n\n\"I will, your excellency,\" said Timokhin, showing by his smile\nthat he understood his commander\'s wish.\n\n\"Well, of course, of course!\"\n\nThe regimental commander sought out Dolokhov in the ranks and,\nreining in his horse, said to him:\n\n\"After the next affair... epaulettes.\"\n\nDolokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the\nmocking smile on his lips change.\n\n\"Well, that\'s all right,\" continued the regimental commander. \"A cup\nof vodka for the men from me,\" he added so that the soldiers could\nhear. \"I thank you all! God be praised!\" and he rode past that company\nand overtook the next one.\n\n\"Well, he\'s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,\" said\nTimokhin to the subaltern beside him.\n\n\"In a word, a hearty one...\" said the subaltern, laughing (the\nregimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).\n\nThe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected\nthe soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers\' voices could\nbe heard on every side.\n\n\"And they said Kutuzov was blind of one eye?\"\n\n\"And so he is! Quite blind!\"\n\n\"No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands...\nhe noticed everything...\"\n\n\"When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...\"\n\n\"And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were\nsmeared with chalk--as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as\nthey do the guns.\"\n\n\"I say, Fedeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You\nwere near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.\"\n\n\"Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn\'t\nknow! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are\nputting them down. When they\'ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte\nwill begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you\'re a fool.\nYou\'d better listen more carefully!\"\n\n\"What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is\nturning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat\ncooked before we reach our quarters.\"\n\n\"Give me a biscuit, you devil!\"\n\n\"And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That\'s just it, friend!\nAh, well, never mind, here you are.\"\n\n\"They might call a halt here or we\'ll have to do another four\nmiles without eating.\"\n\n\"Wasn\'t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still\nand are drawn along.\"\n\n\"And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all\nseemed to be Poles--all under the Russian crown--but here they\'re\nall regular Germans.\"\n\n\"Singers to the front\" came the captain\'s order.\n\nAnd from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A\ndrummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and\nflourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers\' song, commencing\nwith the words: \"Morning dawned, the sun was rising,\" and\nconcluding: \"On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father\nKamenski.\" This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now\nbeing sung in Austria, the only change being that the words \"Father\nKamenski\" were replaced by \"Father Kutuzov.\"\n\nHaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms\nas if flinging something to the ground, the drummer--a lean,\nhandsome soldier of forty--looked sternly at the singers and screwed\nup his eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on\nhim, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but\nprecious object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds,\nsuddenly flung it down and began:\n\n\"Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!\"\n\n\"Oh, my bower new...!\" chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet\nplayer, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the\nfront and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his\nshoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone.\nThe soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously,\nmarched with long steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the\ncreaking of springs, and the tramp of horses\' hoofs were heard.\nKutuzov and his suite were returning to the town. The commander in\nchief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and\nhe and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and\nthe sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men.\nIn the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage\npassed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted\nnotice. It was Dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in\ntime to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all\nwho were not at that moment marching with the company. The hussar\ncornet of Kutuzov\'s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander,\nfell back from the carriage and rode up to Dolokhov.\n\nHussar cornet Zherkov had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to\nthe wild set led by Dolokhov. Zherkov had met Dolokhov abroad as a\nprivate and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kutuzov\nhad spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the\ncordiality of an old friend.\n\n\"My dear fellow, how are you?\" said he through the singing, making\nhis horse keep pace with the company.\n\n\"How am I?\" Dolokhov answered coldly. \"I am as you see.\"\n\nThe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy\ngaiety with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of\nDolokhov\'s reply.\n\n\"And how do you get on with the officers?\" inquired Zherkov.\n\n\"All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto\nthe staff?\"\n\n\"I was attached; I\'m on duty.\"\n\nBoth were silent.\n\n\"She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,\" went the\nsong, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.\nTheir conversation would probably have been different but for the\neffect of that song.\n\n\"Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?\" asked Dolokhov.\n\n\"The devil only knows! They say so.\"\n\n\"I\'m glad,\" answered Dolokhov briefly and clearly, as the song\ndemanded.\n\n\"I say, come round some evening and we\'ll have a game of faro!\" said\nZherkov.\n\n\"Why, have you too much money?\"\n\n\"Do come.\"\n\n\"I can\'t. I\'ve sworn not to. I won\'t drink and won\'t play till I get\nreinstated.\"\n\n\"Well, that\'s only till the first engagement.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\nThey were again silent.\n\n\"Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the\nstaff...\"\n\nDolokhov smiled. \"Don\'t trouble. If I want anything, I won\'t beg--I\'ll\ntake it!\"\n\n\"Well, never mind; I only...\"\n\n\"And I only...\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\n\"Good health...\"\n\n        \"It\'s a long, long way.\n        To my native land...\"\n\n\nZherkov touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly\nfrom foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down,\ngalloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping\ntime to the song.');

Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the\nroom with the required papers. Kutuzov and the Austrian member of\nthe Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread\nout.\n\n\"Ah!...\" said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by this\nexclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with\nthe conversation in French.\n\n\"All I can say, General,\" said he with a pleasant elegance of\nexpression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each\ndeliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutuzov himself listened\nwith pleasure to his own voice. \"All I can say, General, is that if\nthe matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the\nEmperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long\nago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me\npersonally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command\nof the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful\ngeneral--of whom Austria has so many--and to lay down all this heavy\nresponsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,\nGeneral.\"\n\nAnd Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, \"You are quite at\nliberty not to believe me and I don\'t even care whether you do or not,\nbut you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole\npoint.\"\n\nThe Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to\nreply in the same tone.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" he said, in a querulous and angry tone that\ncontrasted with his flattering words, \"on the contrary, your\nexcellency\'s participation in the common action is highly valued by\nHis Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the\nsplendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have\nbeen accustomed to win in their battles,\" he concluded his evidently\nprearranged sentence.\n\nKutuzov bowed with the same smile.\n\n\"But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with\nwhich His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine\nthat the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a\nleader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive\nvictory and no longer need our aid,\" said Kutuzov.\n\nThe general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an\nAustrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the\nunfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutuzov\'s suggestion of an\nAustrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kutuzov went on\nblandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that\nhe had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had\nreceived from Mack\'s army informed him of a victory and stated\nstrategically the position of the army was very favorable.\n\n\"Give me that letter,\" said Kutuzov turning to Prince Andrew.\n\"Please have a look at it\"--and Kutuzov with an ironical smile about\nthe corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following\npassage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand\'s letter:\n\n\nWe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men\nwith which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech.\nAlso, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage\nof commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not\ncross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line\nof communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his\nintention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful\nally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the\nImperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in\nconjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the\nfate he deserves.\n\n\nKutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at\nthe member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.\n\n\"But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect\nthe worst,\" said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have\ndone with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round\nat the aide-de-camp.\n\n\"Excuse me, General,\" interrupted Kutuzov, also turning to Prince\nAndrew. \"Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlovski all the reports\nfrom our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is\none from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these,\" he\nsaid, handing him several papers, \"make a neat memorandum in French\nout of all this, showing all the news we have had of the movements\nof the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.\"\n\nPrince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from\nthe first not only what had been said but also what Kutuzov would have\nliked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,\nstepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.\n\nThough not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia,\nhe had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his\nface, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of\nhis former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man\nwho has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is\noccupied with agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed\nmore satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and\nglance were brighter and more attractive.\n\nKutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very\nkindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the\nother adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more\nserious commissions. From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrade,\nPrince Andrew\'s father.\n\n\nYour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his\nindustry, firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to\nhave such a subordinate by me.\n\n\nOn Kutuzov\'s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army\ngenerally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two\nquite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be\ndifferent from themselves and from everyone else, expected great\nthings of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with\nthem Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority,\ndisliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But\namong these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that\nthey respected and even feared him.\n\nComing out of Kutuzov\'s room into the waiting room with the papers\nin his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp\non duty, Kozlovski, who was sitting at the window with a book.\n\n\"Well, Prince?\" asked Kozlovski.\n\n\"I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not\nadvancing.\"\n\n\"And why is it?\"\n\nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Any news from Mack?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.\n\nBut at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the\norder of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,\nwho had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.\nPrince Andrew stopped short.\n\n\"Commander in Chief Kutuzov?\" said the newly arrived general\nspeaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and\nadvancing straight toward the inner door.\n\n\"The commander in chief is engaged,\" said Kozlovski, going hurriedly\nup to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. \"Whom\nshall I announce?\"\n\nThe unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski, who was\nrather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.\n\n\"The commander in chief is engaged,\" repeated Kozlovski calmly.\n\nThe general\'s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He\ntook out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out\nthe leaf, gave it to Kozlovski, stepped quickly to the window, and\nthrew himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if\nasking, \"Why do they look at me?\" Then he lifted his head, stretched\nhis neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately, with\naffected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer\nsound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened\nand Kutuzov appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged\nhead bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making\nlong, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kutuzov.\n\n\"Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,\" he uttered in a broken voice.\n\nKutuzov\'s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly\nimmobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a\nwave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head\nrespectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before\nhim, and closed the door himself behind him.\n\nThe report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been\nbeaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be\ncorrect. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various\ndirections with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had\nhitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.\n\nPrince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief\ninterest lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack\nand heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the\ncampaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian\narmy\'s position, and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part\nhe would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the\nthought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week\'s\ntime he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian\nencounter with the French since Suvorov met them. He feared that\nBonaparte\'s genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian\ntroops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero\nbeing disgraced.\n\nExcited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward\nhis room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the\ncorridor he met Nesvitski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag\nZherkov; they were as usual laughing.\n\n\"Why are you so glum?\" asked Nesvitski noticing Prince Andrew\'s pale\nface and glittering eyes.\n\n\"There\'s nothing to be gay about,\" answered Bolkonski.\n\nJust as Prince Andrew met Nesvitski and Zherkov, there came toward\nthem from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian\ngeneral who on Kutuzov\'s staff in charge of the provisioning of the\nRussian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived\nthe previous evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for\nthe generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherkov,\npushing Nesvitski aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,\n\n\"They\'re coming!... they\'re coming!... Stand aside, make way, please\nmake way!\"\n\nThe generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid\nembarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly\nappeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.\n\n\"Your excellency,\" said he in German, stepping forward and\naddressing the Austrian general, \"I have the honor to congratulate\nyou.\"\n\nHe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with\nthe other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.\n\nThe member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing\nthe seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment\'s\nattention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.\n\n\"I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived,\nquite well, only a little bruised just here,\" he added, pointing\nwith a beaming smile to his head.\n\nThe general frowned, turned away, and went on.\n\n\"Gott, wie naiv!\"* said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.\n\n*\"Good God, what simplicity!\"\n\n\nNesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but\nBolkonski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and\nturned to Zherkov. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of\nMack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the\nRussian army found vent in anger at Zherkov\'s untimely jest.\n\n\"If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,\" he said\nsharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, \"I can\'t prevent\nyour doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in\nmy presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.\"\n\nNesvitski and Zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they\ngazed at Bolkonski silently with wide-open eyes.\n\n\"What\'s the matter? I only congratulated them,\" said Zherkov.\n\n\"I am not jesting with you; please be silent!\" cried Bolkonski,\nand taking Nesvitski\'s arm he left Zherkov, who did not know what to\nsay.\n\n\"Come, what\'s the matter, old fellow?\" said Nesvitski trying to\nsoothe him.\n\n\"What\'s the matter?\" exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his\nexcitement. \"Don\'t you understand that either we are officers serving\nour Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at\nthe misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care\nnothing for their master\'s business. Quarante mille hommes massacres\net l\'armee de nos allies detruite, et vous trouvez la le mot pour\nrire,\"* he said, as if strengthening his views by this French\nsentence. \"C\'est bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont\nvous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous.*[2] Only a\nhobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way,\" he added in Russian--but\npronouncing the word with a French accent--having noticed that Zherkov\ncould still hear him.\n\n\n*\"Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed,\nand you find that a cause for jesting!\"\n\n*[2] \"It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow of whom\nyou have made a friend, but not for you, not for you.\"\n\n\nHe waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he\nturned and went out of the corridor.');

The\nsquadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in\nthe German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were\nassigned to cavalry-captain Denisov, the squadron commander, known\nthroughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov. Cadet\nRostov, ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had\nlived with the squadron commander.\n\nOn October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the\nnews of Mack\'s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this\nsquadron was proceeding as usual. Denisov, who had been losing at\ncards all night, had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early\nin the morning from a foraging expedition. Rostov in his cadet\nuniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg\nover the saddle with a supple youthful movement, stood for a moment in\nthe stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse, and at last sprang\ndown and called to his orderly.\n\n\"Ah, Bondarenko, dear friend!\" said he to the hussar who rushed up\nheadlong to the horse. \"Walk him up and down, my dear fellow,\" he\ncontinued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted\nyoung people show to everyone when they are happy.\n\n\"Yes, your excellency,\" answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his\nhead.\n\n\"Mind, walk him up and down well!\"\n\nAnother hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had\nalready thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse\'s\nhead. It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that\nit paid to serve him. Rostov patted the horse\'s neck and then his\nflank, and lingered for a moment.\n\n\"Splendid! What a horse he will be!\" he thought with a smile, and\nholding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the\nporch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork\nin hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his\nface immediately brightened on seeing Rostov. \"Schon gut Morgen! Schon\ngut Morgen!\"* he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to\ngreet the young man.\n\n\n*\"A very good morning! A very good morning!\"\n\n\n\"Schon fleissig?\"* said Rostov with the same gay brotherly smile\nwhich did not leave his eager face. \"Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen!\nKaiser Alexander hoch!\"*[2] said he, quoting words often repeated by\nthe German landlord.\n\n\n*\"Busy already?\"\n\n*[2] \"Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians! Hurrah\nfor Emperor Alexander!\"\n\n\nThe German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and\nwaving it above his head cried:\n\n\"Und die ganze Welt hoch!\"*\n\n\n*\"And hurrah for the whole world!\"\n\n\nRostov waved his cap above his head like the German and cried\nlaughing, \"Und vivat die ganze Welt!\" Though neither the German\ncleaning his cowshed nor Rostov back with his platoon from foraging\nfor hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with\njoyful delight and brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of\ntheir mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German returning to\nhis cowshed and Rostov going to the cottage he occupied with Denisov.\n\n\"What about your master?\" he asked Lavrushka, Denisov\'s orderly,\nwhom all the regiment knew for a rogue.\n\n\"Hasn\'t been in since the evening. Must have been losing,\"\nanswered Lavrushka. \"I know by now, if he wins he comes back early\nto brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he\'s\nlost and will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?\"\n\n\"Yes, bring some.\"\n\nTen minutes later Lavrushka brought the coffee. \"He\'s coming!\"\nsaid he. \"Now for trouble!\" Rostov looked out of the window and saw\nDenisov coming home. Denisov was a small man with a red face,\nsparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore\nan unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a\ncrumpled shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch\ngloomily, hanging his head.\n\n\"Lavwuska!\" he shouted loudly and angrily, \"take it off, blockhead!\"\n\n\"Well, I am taking it off,\" replied Lavrushka\'s voice.\n\n\"Ah, you\'re up already,\" said Denisov, entering the room.\n\n\"Long ago,\" answered Rostov, \"I have already been for the hay, and\nhave seen Fraulein Mathilde.\"\n\n\"Weally! And I\'ve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a\ndamned fool!\" cried Denisov, not pronouncing his r\'s. \"Such ill\nluck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on.\nHullo there! Tea!\"\n\nPuckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong\nteeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his\nthick tangled black hair.\n\n\"And what devil made me go to that wat?\" (an officer nicknamed\n\"the rat\") he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both\nhands. \"Just fancy, he didn\'t let me win a single cahd, not one cahd.\"\n\nHe took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in\nhis fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while\nhe continued to shout.\n\n\"He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles\nit; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!\"\n\nHe scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it\naway. Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked\ncheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostov.\n\n\"If at least we had some women here; but there\'s nothing foh one\nto do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who\'s\nthere?\" he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy\nboots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a\nrespectful cough.\n\n\"The squadron quartermaster!\" said Lavrushka.\n\nDenisov\'s face puckered still more.\n\n\"Wetched!\" he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in\nit. \"Wostov, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove\nthe purse undah the pillow,\" he said, and went out to the\nquartermaster.\n\nRostov took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new\ncoins in separate piles, began counting them.\n\n\"Ah! Telyanin! How d\'ye do? They plucked me last night,\" came\nDenisov\'s voice from the next room.\n\n\"Where? At Bykov\'s, at the rat\'s... I knew it,\" replied a piping\nvoice, and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer of the same\nsquadron, entered the room.\n\nRostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little\nhand which was offered him. Telyanin for some reason had been\ntransferred from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very\nwell in the regiment but was not liked; Rostov especially detested him\nand was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to\nthe man.\n\n\"Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?\" he asked. (Rook\nwas a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov.)\n\nThe lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in\nthe face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.\n\n\"I saw you riding this morning...\" he added.\n\n\"Oh, he\'s all right, a good horse,\" answered Rostov, though the\nhorse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half\nthat sum. \"He\'s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"The hoof\'s cracked! That\'s nothing. I\'ll teach you what to do and\nshow you what kind of rivet to use.\"\n\n\"Yes, please do,\" said Rostov.\n\n\"I\'ll show you, I\'ll show you! It\'s not a secret. And it\'s a horse\nyou\'ll thank me for.\"\n\n\"Then I\'ll have it brought round,\" said Rostov wishing to avoid\nTelyanin, and he went out to give the order.\n\nIn the passage Denisov, with a pipe, was squatting on the\nthreshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing\nRostov, Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder\nwith his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, he frowned\nand gave a shudder of disgust.\n\n\"Ugh! I don\'t like that fellow,\" he said, regardless of the\nquartermaster\'s presence.\n\nRostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: \"Nor do I, but\nwhat\'s one to do?\" and, having given his order, he returned to\nTelyanin.\n\nTelyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had\nleft him, rubbing his small white hands.\n\n\"Well there certainly are disgusting people,\" thought Rostov as he\nentered.\n\n\"Have you told them to bring the horse?\" asked Telyanin, getting\nup and looking carelessly about him.\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denisov about\nyesterday\'s order. Have you got it, Denisov?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But where are you off to?\"\n\n\"I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,\" said Telyanin.\n\nThey went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant\nexplained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.\n\nWhen Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on\nthe table. Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a\nsheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rostov\'s face and said: \"I am\nwiting to her.\"\n\nHe leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,\nevidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to\nwrite, told Rostov the contents of his letter.\n\n\"You see, my fwiend,\" he said, \"we sleep when we don\'t love. We\nare childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God,\none is pua\' as on the first day of cweation... Who\'s that now? Send\nhim to the devil, I\'m busy!\" he shouted to Lavrushka, who went up to\nhim not in the least abashed.\n\n\"Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It\'s the\nquartermaster for the money.\"\n\nDenisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.\n\n\"Wetched business,\" he muttered to himself. \"How much is left in the\npuhse?\" he asked, turning to Rostov.\n\n\"Seven new and three old imperials.\"\n\n\"Oh, it\'s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you\nsca\'cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,\" he shouted to Lavrushka.\n\n\"Please, Denisov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,\" said\nRostov, blushing.\n\n\"Don\'t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don\'t,\" growled\nDenisov.\n\n\"But if you won\'t accept money from me like a comrade, you will\noffend me. Really I have some,\" Rostov repeated.\n\n\"No, I tell you.\"\n\nAnd Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.\n\n\"Where have you put it, Wostov?\"\n\n\"Under the lower pillow.\"\n\n\"It\'s not there.\"\n\nDenisov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.\n\n\"That\'s a miwacle.\"\n\n\"Wait, haven\'t you dropped it?\" said Rostov, picking up the\npillows one at a time and shaking them.\n\nHe pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.\n\n\"Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you\nkept it under your head like a treasure,\" said Rostov. \"I put it\njust here. Where is it?\" he asked, turning to Lavrushka.\n\n\"I haven\'t been in the room. It must be where you put it.\"\n\n\"But it isn\'t?...\"\n\n\"You\'re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget\nit. Feel in your pockets.\"\n\n\"No, if I hadn\'t thought of it being a treasure,\" said Rostov,\n\"but I remember putting it there.\"\n\nLavrushka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and\nunder the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of\nthe room. Denisov silently watched Lavrushka\'s movements, and when the\nlatter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found\nDenisov glanced at Rostov.\n\n\"Wostov, you\'ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...\"\n\nRostov felt Denisov\'s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and\ninstantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested\nsomewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not\ndraw breath.\n\n\"And there hasn\'t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant\nand yourselves. It must be here somewhere,\" said Lavrushka.\n\n\"Now then, you devil\'s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!\"\nshouted Denisov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man\nwith a threatening gesture. \"If the purse isn\'t found I\'ll flog you,\nI\'ll flog you all.\"\n\nRostov, his eyes avoiding Denisov, began buttoning his coat, buckled\non his saber, and put on his cap.\n\n\"I must have that purse, I tell you,\" shouted Denisov, shaking his\norderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.\n\n\"Denisov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,\" said Rostov,\ngoing toward the door without raising his eyes. Denisov paused,\nthought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostov hinted\nat, seized his arm.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood\nout like cords. \"You are mad, I tell you. I won\'t allow it. The\npurse is here! I\'ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found.\"\n\n\"I know who has taken it,\" repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice, and\nwent to the door.\n\n\"And I tell you, don\'t you dahe to do it!\" shouted Denisov,\nrushing at the cadet to restrain him.\n\nBut Rostov pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though\nDenisov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his\nface.\n\n\"Do you understand what you\'re saying?\" he said in a trembling\nvoice. \"There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it\nis not so, then...\"\n\nHe could not finish, and ran out of the room.\n\n\"Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,\" were the last words\nRostov heard.\n\nRostov went to Telyanin\'s quarters.\n\n\"The master is not in, he\'s gone to headquarters,\" said Telyanin\'s\norderly. \"Has something happened?\" he added, surprised at the\ncadet\'s troubled face.\n\n\"No, nothing.\"\n\n\"You\'ve only just missed him,\" said the orderly.\n\nThe headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and\nRostov, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was\nan inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostov rode up to\nit and saw Telyanin\'s horse at the porch.\n\nIn the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish\nof sausages and a bottle of wine.\n\n\"Ah, you\'ve come here too, young man!\" he said, smiling and\nraising his eyebrows.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word;\nand he sat down at the nearest table.\n\nBoth were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in\nthe room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of\nknives and the munching of the lieutenant.\n\nWhen Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a\ndouble purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white,\nturned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his\neyebrows gave it to the waiter.\n\n\"Please be quick,\" he said.\n\nThe coin was a new one. Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin.\n\n\"Allow me to look at your purse,\" he said in a low, almost\ninaudible, voice.\n\nWith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin handed him\nthe purse.\n\n\"Yes, it\'s a nice purse. Yes, yes,\" he said, growing suddenly\npale, and added, \"Look at it, young man.\"\n\nRostov took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in\nit, and looked at Telyanin. The lieutenant was looking about in his\nusual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.\n\n\"If we get to Vienna I\'ll get rid of it there but in these\nwretched little towns there\'s nowhere to spend it,\" said he. \"Well,\nlet me have it, young man, I\'m going.\"\n\nRostov did not speak.\n\n\"And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite\ndecently here,\" continued Telyanin. \"Now then, let me have it.\"\n\nHe stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostov let go\nof it. Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into\nthe pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his\nmouth slightly open, as if to say, \"Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in\nmy pocket and that\'s quite simple and is no one else\'s business.\"\n\n\"Well, young man?\" he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted\nbrows he glanced into Rostov\'s eyes.\n\nSome flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin\'s eyes to\nRostov\'s and back, and back again and again in an instant.\n\n\"Come here,\" said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin\'s arm and almost\ndragging him to the window. \"That money is Denisov\'s; you took\nit...\" he whispered just above Telyanin\'s ear.\n\n\"What? What? How dare you? What?\" said Telyanin.\n\nBut these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an\nentreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostov heard them, an enormous load of\ndoubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to\npity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun\nhad to be completed.\n\n\"Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,\" muttered\nTelyanin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room.\n\"We must have an explanation...\"\n\n\"I know it and shall prove it,\" said Rostov.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nEvery muscle of Telyanin\'s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his\neyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not\nrising to Rostov\'s face, and his sobs were audible.\n\n\"Count!... Don\'t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,\ntake it...\" He threw it on the table. \"I have an old father and\nmother!...\"\n\nRostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin\'s eyes, and went out of the\nroom without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced\nhis steps. \"O God,\" he said with tears in his eyes, \"how could you\ndo it?\"\n\n\"Count...\" said Telyanin drawing nearer to him.\n\n\"Don\'t touch me,\" said Rostov, drawing back. \"If you need it, take\nthe money,\" and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.');

And there it rests. He may keep me on\nduty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me\napologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it\nbeneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...\"\n\n\"You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,\" interrupted\nthe staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.\n\"You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an\nofficer has stolen...\"\n\n\"I\'m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of\nother officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but\nI am not a diplomatist. That\'s why I joined the hussars, thinking that\nhere one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying--so\nlet him give me satisfaction...\"\n\n\"That\'s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that\'s not the\npoint. Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet\nto demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?\"\n\nDenisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the\nconversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered\nthe staff captain\'s question by a disapproving shake of his head.\n\n\"You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other\nofficers,\" continued the staff captain, \"and Bogdanich\" (the colonel\nwas called Bogdanich) \"shuts you up.\"\n\n\"He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.\"\n\n\"Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and\nmust apologize.\"\n\n\"Not on any account!\" exclaimed Rostov.\n\n\"I did not expect this of you,\" said the staff captain seriously and\nseverely. \"You don\'t wish to apologize, but, man, it\'s not only to him\nbut to the whole regiment--all of us--you\'re to blame all round. The\ncase is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken\nadvice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the\nofficers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and\ndisgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of\none scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don\'t see it like\nthat. And Bogdanich was a brick: he told you you were saying what\nwas not true. It\'s not pleasant, but what\'s to be done, my dear\nfellow? You landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth\nthe thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish\nto make the whole affair public. You are offended at being put on duty\na bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever\nBogdanich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel!\nYou\'re quick at taking offense, but you don\'t mind disgracing the\nwhole regiment!\" The staff captain\'s voice began to tremble. \"You have\nbeen in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you\'re here today and\ntomorrow you\'ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your\nfingers when it is said \'There are thieves among the Pavlograd\nofficers!\' But it\'s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denisov?\nIt\'s not the same!\"\n\nDenisov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked\nwith his glittering black eyes at Rostov.\n\n\"You value your own pride and don\'t wish to apologize,\" continued\nthe staff captain, \"but we old fellows, who have grown up in and,\nGod willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of\nthe regiment, and Bogdanich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old\nfellow! And all this is not right, it\'s not right! You may take\noffense or not but I always stick to mother truth.

I quite understand.\nYou\'re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of\nthe regiment I\'d... Ah well, I\'ll show that in action, and for me\nthe honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it\'s true I\'m to blame,\nto blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...\"\n\n\"Come, that\'s right, Count!\" cried the staff captain, turning\nround and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand.\n\n\"I tell you,\" shouted Denisov, \"he\'s a fine fellow.\"\n\n\"That\'s better, Count,\" said the staff captain, beginning to address\nRostov by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. \"Go and\napologize, your excellency. Yes, go!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, I\'ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,\"\nsaid Rostov in an imploring voice, \"but I can\'t apologize, by God I\ncan\'t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little\nboy asking forgiveness?\"\n\nDenisov began to laugh.\n\n\"It\'ll be worse for you.

I can\'t describe the feeling.\nI can\'t...\"\n\n\"Well, it\'s as you like,\" said the staff captain. \"And what has\nbecome of that scoundrel?\" he asked Denisov.\n\n\"He has weported himself sick, he\'s to be stwuck off the list\ntomowwow,\" muttered Denisov.\n\n\"It is an illness, there\'s no other way of explaining it,\" said\nthe staff captain.\n\n\"Illness or not, he\'d better not cwoss my path.

On October\n23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the\nRussian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were\ndefiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.\n\nIt was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out\nbefore the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the\nbridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain,\nand then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects\ncould be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down\nbelow, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed\nhouses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed\njostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels,\nan island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the\nconfluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky\nleft bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic\nbackground of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a\nconvent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on\nthe other side of the Enns the enemy\'s horse patrols could be\ndiscerned.\n\nAmong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in\ncommand of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the\ncountry through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvitski, who\nhad been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was\nsitting on the trail of a gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied\nhim had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvitski was\ntreating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel. The officers\ngladly gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish\nfashion on the wet grass.\n\n\"Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It\'s\na fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?\" Nesvitski\nwas saying.\n\n\"Thank you very much, Prince,\" answered one of the officers, pleased\nto be talking to a staff officer of such importance. \"It\'s a lovely\nplace! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a\nsplendid house!\"\n\n\"Look, Prince,\" said another, who would have dearly liked to take\nanother pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining\nthe countryside--\"See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look\nthere in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging\nsomething. They\'ll ransack that castle,\" he remarked with evident\napproval.\n\n\"So they will,\" said Nesvitski. \"No, but what I should like,\"\nadded he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, \"would be\nto slip in over there.\"\n\nHe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed\nand gleamed.\n\n\"That would be fine, gentlemen!\"\n\nThe officers laughed.\n\n\"Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls\namong them. On my word I\'d give five years of my life for it!\"\n\n\"They must be feeling dull, too,\" said one of the bolder officers,\nlaughing.\n\nMeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out\nsomething to the general, who looked through his field glass.\n\n\"Yes, so it is, so it is,\" said the general angrily, lowering the\nfield glass and shrugging his shoulders, \"so it is! They\'ll be fired\non at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?\"\n\nOn the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and\nfrom their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant\nreport of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the\ncrossing.\n\nNesvitski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.\n\n\"Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?\" he said.\n\n\"It\'s a bad business,\" said the general without answering him,\n\"our men have been wasting time.\"\n\n\"Hadn\'t I better ride over, your excellency?\" asked Nesvitski.\n\n\"Yes, please do,\" answered the general, and he repeated the order\nthat had already once been given in detail: \"and tell the hussars that\nthey are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the\ninflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" answered Nesvitski.\n\nHe called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the\nknapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.\n\n\"I\'ll really call in on the nuns,\" he said to the officers who\nwatched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the\nhill.\n\n\"Now then, let\'s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!\" said\nthe general, turning to an artillery officer. \"Have a little fun to\npass the time.\"\n\n\"Crew, to your guns!\" commanded the officer.\n\nIn a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and\nbegan loading.\n\n\"One!\" came the command.\n\nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening\nmetallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our\ntroops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little\nsmoke showing the spot where it burst.\n\nThe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone\ngot up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as\nplainly visible as if but a stone\'s throw away, and the movements of\nthe approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came\nfully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the\nsolitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a\nsingle joyous and spirited impression.');

Halfway across stood Prince Nesvitski, who\nhad alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed\nagainst the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood\na few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each\ntime Prince Nesvitski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed\nhim back again and pressed him against the railings, and all he\ncould do was to smile.\n\n\"What a fine fellow you are, friend!\" said the Cossack to a convoy\nsoldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were\ncrowded together close to his wheels and his horses. \"What a fellow!\nYou can\'t wait a moment! Don\'t you see the general wants to pass?\"\n\nBut the convoyman took no notice of the word \"general\" and shouted\nat the soldiers who were blocking his way. \"Hi there, boys! Keep to\nthe left! Wait a bit.\" But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder\nto shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a\ndense mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvitski saw the\nrapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying\nround the piles of the bridge chased each other along. Looking on\nthe bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder\nstraps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and,\nunder the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and\nlistless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky mud\nthat covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the\nmonotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of\nthe Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different\nfrom that of the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip of\nwood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a\ntownsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and sometimes like\na log floating down the river, an officers\' or company\'s baggage\nwagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides,\nmoved across the bridge.\n\n\"It\'s as if a dam had burst,\" said the Cossack hopelessly. \"Are\nthere many more of you to come?\"\n\n\"A million all but one!\" replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat,\nwith a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.\n\n\"If he\" (he meant the enemy) \"begins popping at the bridge now,\"\nsaid the old soldier dismally to a comrade, \"you\'ll forget to\nscratch yourself.\"\n\nThat soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a\ncart.\n\n\"Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?\" said an\norderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.\n\nAnd he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry\nsoldiers who had evidently been drinking.\n\n\"And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt\nend of his gun...\" a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said\ngaily, with a wide swing of his arm.\n\n\"Yes, the ham was just delicious...\" answered another with a loud\nlaugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvitski did not learn who\nhad been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.\n\n\"Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they\'ll\nall be killed,\" a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.\n\n\"As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,\" said a young\nsoldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, \"I\nfelt like dying of fright. I did, \'pon my word, I got that\nfrightened!\" said he, as if bragging of having been frightened.\n\nThat one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had\ngone before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a\nGerman, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine\nbrindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A\nwoman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl\nwith bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently\nthese fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes\nof all the soldiers turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was\npassing at foot pace all the soldiers\' remarks related to the two\nyoung ones. Every face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly\nthoughts about the women.\n\n\"Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!\"\n\n\"Sell me the missis,\" said another soldier, addressing the German,\nwho, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast\neyes.\n\n\"See how smart she\'s made herself! Oh, the devils!\"\n\n\"There, Fedotov, you should be quartered on them!\"\n\n\"I have seen as much before now, mate!\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked an infantry officer who was eating an\napple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.\n\nThe German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.\n\n\"Take it if you like,\" said the officer, giving the girl an apple.\n\nThe girl smiled and took it. Nesvitski like the rest of the men on\nthe bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed.\nWhen they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with\nthe same kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens,\nthe horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the\nbridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.\n\n\"And why are they stopping? There\'s no proper order!\" said the\nsoldiers. \"Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can\'t you wait?\nIt\'ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here\'s an officer jammed\nin too\"--different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men\nlooked at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the\nbridge.\n\nLooking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvitski\nsuddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...\nsomething big, that splashed into the water.\n\n\"Just see where it carries to!\" a soldier near by said sternly,\nlooking round at the sound.\n\n\"Encouraging us to get along quicker,\" said another uneasily.\n\nThe crowd moved on again. Nesvitski realized that it was a cannon\nball.\n\n\"Hey, Cossack, my horse!\" he said. \"Now, then, you there! get out of\nthe way! Make way!\"\n\nWith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting\ncontinually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make\nway for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and\nthose nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed\nstill harder from behind.\n\n\"Nesvitski, Nesvitski! you numskull!\" came a hoarse voice from\nbehind him.\n\nNesvitski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but\nseparated by the living mass of moving infantry, Vaska Denisov, red\nand shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak\nhanging jauntily over his shoulder.\n\n\"Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!\" shouted Denisov\nevidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot\nwhites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a\nsmall bare hand as red as his face.\n\n\"Ah, Vaska!\" joyfully replied Nesvitski. \"What\'s up with you?\"\n\n\"The squadwon can\'t pass,\" shouted Vaska Denisov, showing his\nwhite teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which\ntwitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting\nwhite foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his\nhoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider\nlet him. \"What is this? They\'re like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of\nthe way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart!\nI\'ll hack you with my saber!\" he shouted, actually drawing his saber\nfrom its scabbard and flourishing it.\n\nThe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and\nDenisov joined Nesvitski.\n\n\"How\'s it you\'re not drunk today?\" said Nesvitski when the other had\nridden up to him.\n\n\"They don\'t even give one time to dwink!\" answered Vaska Denisov.\n\"They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean to\nfight, let\'s fight. But the devil knows what this is.\"\n\n\"What a dandy you are today!\" said Nesvitski, looking at Denisov\'s\nnew cloak and saddlecloth.\n\nDenisov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that\ndiffused a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvitski\'s nose.\n\n\"Of course. I\'m going into action! I\'ve shaved, bwushed my teeth,\nand scented myself.\"\n\nThe imposing figure of Nesvitski followed by his Cossack, and the\ndetermination of Denisov who flourished his sword and shouted\nfrantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through\nto the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the\nbridge Nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the\norder, and having done this he rode back.\n\nHaving cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge.\nCarelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the\nground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw\nnearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,\nresounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in\nfront and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to\nemerge on his side of it.\n\nThe infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the\ntrampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,\nestrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually\nencounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past\nthem in regular order.\n\n\"Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!\" said one.\n\n\"What good are they? They\'re led about just for show!\" remarked\nanother.\n\n\"Don\'t kick up the dust, you infantry!\" jested an hussar whose\nprancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.\n\n\"I\'d like to put you on a two days\' march with a knapsack! Your fine\ncords would soon get a bit rubbed,\" said an infantryman, wiping the\nmud off his face with his sleeve. \"Perched up there, you\'re more\nlike a bird than a man.\"\n\n\"There now, Zikin, they ought to put you on a horse. You\'d look\nfine,\" said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent\nunder the weight of his knapsack.\n\n\"Take a stick between your legs, that\'ll suit you for a horse!\"\nthe hussar shouted back.');

At last\nthe baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last\nbattalion came onto the bridge. Only Denisov\'s squadron of hussars\nremained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could\nbe seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible\nfrom the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which\nthe river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile\naway. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of\nour Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the\nhigh ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These\nwere the French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at\na trot. All the officers and men of Denisov\'s squadron, though they\ntried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought\nonly of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking\nat the patches appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the\nenemy\'s troops. The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun\nwas descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around\nit. It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of\nthe enemy could be heard from the hill. There was no one now between\nthe squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An\nempty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them.\nThe enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible,\nand intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the\nmore clearly felt.\n\n\"One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line\ndividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and\ndeath. And what is there? Who is there?--there beyond that field, that\ntree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to\nknow. You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner\nor later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is\nthere, just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other\nside of death. But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and\nare surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men.\" So\nthinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the\nenemy, and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness\nof impression to everything that takes place at such moments.\n\nOn the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon\nrose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron.\nThe officers who had been standing together rode off to their\nplaces. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence\nfell on the whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and\nat the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command. A second\nand a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the\nhussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads\nof the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not\nlook round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of\ncommand, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so\ndifferent, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the\nstirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads\nglanced at one another, curious to see their comrades\' impression.\nEvery face, from Denisov\'s to that of the bugler, showed one common\nexpression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and\nmouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if\nthreatening to punish them. Cadet Mironov ducked every time a ball\nflew past. Rostov on the left flank, mounted on his Rook--a handsome\nhorse despite its game leg--had the happy air of a schoolboy called up\nbefore a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he\nwill distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear,\nbright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under\nfire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of\nsomething new and stern showed round the mouth.\n\n\"Who\'s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwonov! That\'s not wight!\nLook at me,\" cried Denisov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept\nturning his horse in front of the squadron.\n\nThe black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Vaska Denisov, and his whole\nshort sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in\nwhich he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually\ndid, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second\nbottle; he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown\nback like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into\nthe sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling\nbackwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the\nsquadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their\npistols. He rode up to Kirsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed,\nsteady mare came at a walk to meet him. His face with its long\nmustache was serious as always, only his eyes were brighter than\nusual.\n\n\"Well, what about it?\" said he to Denisov. \"It won\'t come to a\nfight. You\'ll see--we shall retire.\"\n\n\"The devil only knows what they\'re about!\" muttered Denisov. \"Ah,\nWostov,\" he cried noticing the cadet\'s bright face, \"you\'ve got it\nat last.\"\n\nAnd he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet.\nRostov felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the\nbridge. Denisov galloped up to him.\n\n\"Your excellency! Let us attack them! I\'ll dwive them off.\"\n\n\"Attack indeed!\" said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his\nface as if driving off a troublesome fly. \"And why are you stopping\nhere? Don\'t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the\nsquadron back.\"\n\nThe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire\nwithout having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in\nthe front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted\nthe farther side of the river.\n\nThe two Pavlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up\nthe hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdanich\nSchubert, came up to Denisov\'s squadron and rode at a footpace not far\nfrom Rostov, without taking any notice of him although they were now\nmeeting for the first time since their encounter concerning\nTelyanin. Rostov, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of\na man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not\nlift his eyes from the colonel\'s athletic back, his nape covered\nwith light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostov that\nBogdanich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole\naim now was to test the cadet\'s courage, so he drew himself up and\nlooked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdanich rode\nso near in order to show him his courage. Next he thought that his\nenemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish\nhim--Rostov. Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdanich would\ncome up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the\nhand of reconciliation.\n\nThe high-shouldered figure of Zherkov, familiar to the Pavlograds as\nhe had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After\nhis dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained in the\nregiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front\nwhen he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and\nhad succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince\nBagration. He now came to his former chief with an order from the\ncommander of the rear guard.\n\n\"Colonel,\" he said, addressing Rostov\'s enemy with an air of\ngloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, \"there is an\norder to stop and fire the bridge.\"\n\n\"An order to who?\" asked the colonel morosely.\n\n\"I don\'t myself know \'to who,\'\" replied the cornet in a serious\ntone, \"but the prince told me to \'go and tell the colonel that the\nhussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.\'\"\n\nZherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the\ncolonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout\nNesvitski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely\ncarry his weight.\n\n\"How\'s this, Colonel?\" he shouted as he approached. \"I told you to\nfire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are\nall beside themselves over there and one can\'t make anything out.\"\n\nThe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to\nNesvitski.\n\n\"You spoke to me of inflammable material,\" said he, \"but you said\nnothing about firing it.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sir,\" said Nesvitski as he drew up, taking off his cap\nand smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,\n\"wasn\'t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material\nhad been put in position?\"\n\n\"I am not your \'dear sir,\' Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell\nme to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders\nstrictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would\nit burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!\"\n\n\"Ah, that\'s always the way!\" said Nesvitski with a wave of the hand.\n\"How did you get here?\" said he, turning to Zherkov.\n\n\"On the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!\"\n\n\"You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...\" continued the colonel in\nan offended tone.\n\n\"Colonel,\" interrupted the officer of the suite, \"You must be\nquick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.\"\n\nThe colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the\nstout staff officer, and at Zherkov, and he frowned.\n\n\"I will the bridge fire,\" he said in a solemn tone as if to announce\nthat in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would\nstill do the right thing.\n\nStriking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to\nblame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second\nsquadron, that in which Rostov was serving under Denisov, to return to\nthe bridge.\n\n\"There, it\'s just as I thought,\" said Rostov to himself. \"He\nwishes to test me!\" His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his\nface. \"Let him see whether I am a coward!\" he thought.\n\nAgain on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression\nappeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostov watched his enemy,\nthe colonel, closely--to find in his face confirmation of his own\nconjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostov, and\nlooked as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came\nthe word of command.\n\n\"Look sharp! Look sharp!\" several voices repeated around him.\n\nTheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the\nhussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The\nmen were crossing themselves. Rostov no longer looked at the\ncolonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the\nhussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand\ntrembled as he gave his horse into an orderly\'s charge, and he felt\nthe blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denisov rode past him,\nleaning back and shouting something. Rostov saw nothing but the\nhussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their\nsabers clattering.\n\n\"Stretchers!\" shouted someone behind him.\n\nRostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,\ntrying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not\nlooking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud,\nstumbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.\n\n\"At boss zides, Captain,\" he heard the voice of the colonel, who,\nhaving ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a\ntriumphant, cheerful face.\n\nRostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy\nand was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the\nfront the better. But Bogdanich, without looking at or recognizing\nRostov, shouted to him:\n\n\"Who\'s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right!\nCome back, Cadet!\" he cried angrily; and turning to Denisov, who,\nshowing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:\n\n\"Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, every bullet has its billet,\" answered Vaska Denisov, turning\nin his saddle.\n\n\nMeanwhile Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite were\nstanding together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small\ngroup of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,\nand blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then\nat what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side--the\nblue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as\nartillery.\n\n\"Will they burn the bridge or not? Who\'ll get there first? Will they\nget there and fire the bridge or will the French get within\ngrapeshot range and wipe them out?\" These were the questions each\nman of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily\nasked himself with a sinking heart--watching the bridge and the\nhussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from\nthe other side with their bayonets and guns.\n\n\"Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!\" said Nesvitski; \"they are within\ngrapeshot range now.\"\n\n\"He shouldn\'t have taken so many men,\" said the officer of the\nsuite.\n\n\"True enough,\" answered Nesvitski; \"two smart fellows could have\ndone the job just as well.\"\n\n\"Ah, your excellency,\" put in Zherkov, his eyes fixed on the\nhussars, but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know\nwhether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. \"Ah, your excellency!\nHow you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the\nVladimir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered,\nthe squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon.\nOur Bogdanich knows how things are done.\"\n\n\"There now!\" said the officer of the suite, \"that\'s grapeshot.\"\n\nHe pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being\ndetached and hurriedly removed.\n\nOn the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke\nappeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at\nthe moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two\nreports one after another, and a third.\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, seizing the\nofficer of the suite by the arm. \"Look! A man has fallen! Fallen,\nfallen!\"\n\n\"Two, I think.\"\n\n\"If I were Tsar I would never go to war,\" said Nesvitski, turning\naway.\n\nThe French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue\nuniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again but\nat irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the\nbridge. But this time Nesvitski could not see what was happening\nthere, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had\nsucceeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now\nfiring at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were\ntrained and there was someone to fire at.\n\nThe French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the\nhussars got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot\nwent too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of\nhussars and knocked three of them over.\n\nRostov, absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had paused on\nthe bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he\nhad always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the\nbridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like\nthe other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard\na rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar\nnearest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostov ran up to\nhim with the others. Again someone shouted, \"Stretchers!\" Four men\nseized the hussar and began lifting him.\n\n\"Oooh! For Christ\'s sake let me alone!\" cried the wounded man, but\nstill he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.\n\nNicholas Rostov turned away and, as if searching for something,\ngazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky,\nand at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm,\nand how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what\nsoft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer\nstill were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery,\nthe mysterious gorges, and the pine forests veiled in the mist of\ntheir summits... There was peace and happiness... \"I should wish\nfor nothing else, nothing, if only I were there,\" thought Rostov.\n\"In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness;\nbut here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry...\nThere--they are shouting again, and again are all running back\nsomewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here above\nme and around... Another instant and I shall never again see the\nsun, this water, that gorge!...\"\n\nAt that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other\nstretchers came into view before Rostov. And the fear of death and\nof the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into\none feeling of sickening agitation.\n\n\"O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect\nme!\" Rostov whispered.\n\nThe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their\nvoices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from\nsight.\n\n\"Well, fwiend? So you\'ve smelt powdah!\" shouted Vaska Denisov just\nabove his ear.\n\n\"It\'s all over; but I am a coward--yes, a coward!\" thought Rostov,\nand sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one\nfoot, from the orderly and began to mount.\n\n\"Was that grapeshot?\" he asked Denisov.\n\n\"Yes and no mistake!\" cried Denisov. \"You worked like wegular bwicks\nand it\'s nasty work! An attack\'s pleasant work! Hacking away at the\ndogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them shooting\nat you like a target.\"\n\nAnd Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostov,\ncomposed of the colonel, Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer from\nthe suite.\n\n\"Well, it seems that no one has noticed,\" thought Rostov. And this\nwas true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation\nwhich the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.\n\n\"Here\'s something for you to report,\" said Zherkov. \"See if I\ndon\'t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.\"\n\n\"Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!\" said the colonel\ntriumphantly and gaily.\n\n\"And if he asks about the losses?\"\n\n\"A trifle,\" said the colonel in his bass voice: \"two hussars\nwounded, and one knocked out,\" he added, unable to restrain a happy\nsmile, and pronouncing the phrase \"knocked out\" with ringing\ndistinctness.');

There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and\nMelk; but despite the courage and endurance--acknowledged even by\nthe enemy--with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of\nthese actions was a yet more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had\nescaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutuzov at Braunau now separated\nfrom the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left with only his own weak and\nexhausted forces. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought\nof. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared\nin accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to\nKutuzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the\nsole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a\njunction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, without\nlosing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his army crossed to the\nleft bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with\nthe river between himself and the main body of the French. On the\nthirtieth he attacked Mortier\'s division, which was on the left\nbank, and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were\ntaken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time,\nafter a fortnight\'s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a\nfight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French.\nThough the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of\ntheir number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number\nof sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube\nwith a letter in which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the\nenemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems\nconverted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all\nthe sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over\nMortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the\nwhole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors\nwere rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some\nvictory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of the\nfrightened Bonaparte.\n\nPrince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the\nAustrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse\nhad been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a\nbullet. As a mark of the commander in chief\'s special favor he was\nsent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no\nlonger at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Brunn.\nDespite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure\nphysical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the\nnight of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary,\nwith dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov, he was sent immediately\nwith a special dispatch to Brunn. To be so sent meant not only a\nreward but an important step toward promotion.\n\nThe night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow\nthat had fallen the previous day--the day of the battle. Reviewing his\nimpressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself\nthe impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the\nsend-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow\nofficers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise\nenjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a\nlong-desired happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes his ears\nseemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of\nvictory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running\naway and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself\nwith a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so\nbut that on the contrary the French had run away. He again recalled\nall the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the\nbattle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark starry night\nwas followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was thawing in the\nsunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road\nwere forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.\n\nAt one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.\nThe Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the\nfront cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each\nof the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were\nbeing jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he\nheard Russian words), others were eating bread; the more severely\nwounded looked silently, with the languid interest of sick children,\nat the envoy hurrying past them.\n\nPrince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what\naction they had been wounded. \"Day before yesterday, on the Danube,\"\nanswered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the\nsoldier three gold pieces.\n\n\"That\'s for them all,\" he said to the officer who came up.\n\n\"Get well soon, lads!\" he continued, turning to the soldiers.\n\"There\'s plenty to do still.\"\n\n\"What news, sir?\" asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a\nconversation.\n\n\"Good news!... Go on!\" he shouted to the driver, and they galloped\non.\n\nIt was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the\npaved streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings,\nthe lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all\nthat atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so\nattractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and\nsleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt\neven more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before. Only his\neyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with\nextraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again vividly recalled the\ndetails of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the\nconcise form in which he imagined himself stating them to\nthe Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that\nmight be put to him and the answers he would give. He expected to be\nat once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the palace,\nhowever, an official came running out to meet him, and learning that\nhe was a special messenger led him to another entrance.\n\n\"To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will\nfind the adjutant on duty,\" said the official. \"He will conduct you to\nthe Minister of War.\"\n\nThe adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait,\nand went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and\nbowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along\na corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The\nadjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any\nattempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.\n\nPrince Andrew\'s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he\napproached the door of the minister\'s room. He felt offended, and\nwithout his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into\none of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind\ninstantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to\ndespise the adjutant and the minister. \"Away from the smell of powder,\nthey probably think it easy to gain victories!\" he thought. His eyes\nnarrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with\npeculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened\nwhen he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers\nand making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three\nminutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each\nside of the minister\'s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went\non reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of\nthe door and the sound of footsteps.\n\n\"Take this and deliver it,\" said he to his adjutant, handing him the\npapers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.\n\nPrince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzov\'s army\ninterested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he\nwas concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger\nthat impression. \"But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,\"\nhe thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together,\narranged them evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual\nand distinctive head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the\nfirm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently\ndeliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial\nsmile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man\nwho is continually receiving many petitioners one after another.\n\n\"From General Field Marshal Kutuzov?\" he asked. \"I hope it is good\nnews? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high\ntime!\"\n\nHe took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it\nwith a mournful expression.\n\n\"Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!\" he exclaimed in German. \"What a\ncalamity! What a calamity!\"\n\nHaving glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and\nlooked at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.\n\n\"Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is\nnot captured.\" Again he pondered. \"I am very glad you have brought\ngood news, though Schmidt\'s death is a heavy price to pay for the\nvictory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I\nthank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the\nparade. However, I will let you know.\"\n\nThe stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,\nreappeared.\n\n\"Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to\nsee you,\" he added, bowing his head.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and\nhappiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the\nindifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant.\nThe whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle\nseemed the memory of a remote event long past.');

I could not have a more welcome visitor,\"\nsaid Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. \"Franz, put the\nprince\'s things in my bedroom,\" said he to the servant who was\nushering Bolkonski in. \"So you\'re a messenger of victory, eh?\nSplendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.\"\n\nAfter washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat\'s\nluxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilibin\nsettled down comfortably beside the fire.\n\nAfter his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived\nof all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life,\nPrince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious\nsurroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides\nit was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not\nin Russian (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who\nwould, he supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the\nAustrians which was then particularly strong.\n\nBilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle\nas Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in\nPetersburg, but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in\nVienna with Kutuzov. Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave\npromise of rising high in the military profession, so to an even\ngreater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic\ncareer. He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had\nentered the service at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and\nCopenhagen, and now held a rather important post in Vienna. Both the\nforeign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him.\nHe was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they\nhave certain negative qualities, avoid doing certain things, and speak\nFrench. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it,\nand despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his\nwriting table. He worked well whatever the import of his work. It\nwas not the question \"What for?\" but the question \"How?\" that\ninterested him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care,\nbut it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or\nreport, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bilibin\'s services\nwere valued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in\ndealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.\n\nBilibin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be\nmade elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to\nsay something striking and took part in a conversation only when\nthat was possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with\nwittily original, finished phrases of general interest. These\nsayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a\nportable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society\npeople might carry them from drawing room to drawing room. And, in\nfact, Bilibin\'s witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing\nrooms and often had an influence on matters considered important.\n\nHis thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which\nalways looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one\'s fingers\nafter a Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the\nprincipal play of expression on his face. Now his forehead would\npucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows\nwould descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small,\ndeep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.\n\n\"Well, now tell me about your exploits,\" said he.\n\nBolkonski, very modestly without once mentioning himself,\ndescribed the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.\n\n\"They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of\nskittles,\" said he in conclusion.\n\nBilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.\n\n\"Cependant, mon cher,\" he remarked, examining his nails from a\ndistance and puckering the skin above his left eye, \"malgre la haute\nestime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j\'avoue que\nvotre victoire n\'est pas des plus victorieuses.\"*\n\n\n*\"But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian\narmy, I must say that your victory was not particularly victorious.\"\n\n\nHe went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those\nwords in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.\n\n\"Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate\nMortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your\nfingers! Where\'s the victory?\"\n\n\"But seriously,\" said Prince Andrew, \"we can at any rate say without\nboasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...\"\n\n\"Why didn\'t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?\"\n\n\"Because not everything happens as one expects or with the\nsmoothness of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at\ntheir rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in\nthe afternoon.\"\n\n\"And why didn\'t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have\nbeen there at seven in the morning,\" returned Bilibin with a smile.\n\"You ought to have been there at seven in the morning.\"\n\n\"Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic\nmethods that he had better leave Genoa alone?\" retorted Prince\nAndrew in the same tone.\n\n\"I know,\" interrupted Bilibin, \"you\'re thinking it\'s very easy to\ntake marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but\nstill why didn\'t you capture him? So don\'t be surprised if not only\nthe Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and\nKing Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor\nsecretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of\nmy joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to\nthe Prater... True, we have no Prater here...\"\n\nHe looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his\nforehead.\n\n\"It is now my turn to ask you \'why?\' mon cher,\" said Bolkonski. \"I\nconfess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties\nhere beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can\'t make it out. Mack\nloses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl\ngive no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kutuzov alone at\nlast gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the invincibility\nof the French, and the Minister of War does not even care to hear\nthe details.\"\n\n\"That\'s just it, my dear fellow. You see it\'s hurrah for the Tsar,\nfor Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but\nwhat do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories?\nBring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one\narchduke\'s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only\nover a fire brigade of Bonaparte\'s, that will be another story and\nwe\'ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on\npurpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke\nFerdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its\ndefense--as much as to say: \'Heaven is with us, but heaven help you\nand your capital!\' The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you\nexpose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit\nthat more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived.\nIt\'s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose\nyou did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a\nvictory, what effect would that have on the general course of\nevents? It\'s too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!\"\n\n\"What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?\"\n\n\"Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn, and the count,\nour dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.\"\n\nAfter the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception,\nand especially after having dined, Bolkonski felt that he could not\ntake in the full significance of the words he heard.\n\n\"Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,\" Bilibin continued, \"and\nshowed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was\nfully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that\nyour victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can\'t be\nreceived as a savior.\"\n\n\"Really I don\'t care about that, I don\'t care at all,\" said Prince\nAndrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before\nKrems was really of small importance in view of such events as the\nfall of Austria\'s capital. \"How is it Vienna was taken? What of the\nbridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard\nreports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?\" he said.\n\n\"Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is\ndefending us--doing it very badly, I think, but still he is\ndefending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has\nnot yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and\norders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago\nhave been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would\nhave spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.\"\n\n\"But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,\" said\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\"Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they\ndaren\'t say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign,\nit won\'t be your skirmishing at Durrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that\nwill decide the matter, but those who devised it,\" said Bilibin\nquoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead,\nand pausing. \"The only question is what will come of the meeting\nbetween the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If\nPrussia joins the Allies, Austria\'s hand will be forced and there will\nbe war. If not it is merely a question of settling where the\npreliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary genius!\" Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,\nclenching his small hand and striking the table with it, \"and what\nluck the man has!\"\n\n\"Buonaparte?\" said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to\nindicate that he was about to say something witty. \"Buonaparte?\" he\nrepeated, accentuating the u: \"I think, however, now that he lays down\nlaws for Austria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l\'u!* I\nshall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!\"\n\n\n*\"We must let him off the u!\"\n\n\n\"But joking apart,\" said Prince Andrew, \"do you really think the\ncampaign is over?\"\n\n\"This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is\nnot used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the\nfirst place because her provinces have been pillaged--they say the\nHoly Russian army loots terribly--her army is destroyed, her capital\ntaken, and all this for the beaux yeux* of His Sardinian Majesty.\nAnd therefore--this is between ourselves--I instinctively feel that we\nare being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France\nand projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.\"\n\n\n*Fine eyes.\n\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Prince Andrew. \"That would be too base.\"\n\n\"If we live we shall see,\" replied Bilibin, his face again\nbecoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in\na clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows,\nhe felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far\naway from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria\'s treachery,\nBonaparte\'s new triumph, tomorrow\'s levee and parade, and the audience\nwith the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of\nmusketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his\nears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were\ndescending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart\npalpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily\nwhistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as\nhe had not done since childhood.\n\nHe woke up...\n\n\"Yes, that all happened!\" he said, and, smiling happily to himself\nlike a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.');

Recalling his recent impressions, the first\nthought that came into his mind was that today he had to be\npresented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War,\nthe polite Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night\'s\nconversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full\nparade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into\nBilibin\'s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged.\nIn the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With\nPrince Hippolyte Kuragin, who was a secretary to the embassy,\nBolkonski was already acquainted. Bilibin introduced him to the\nothers.\n\nThe gentlemen assembled at Bilibin\'s were young, wealthy, gay\nsociety men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which\nBilibin, their leader, called les notres.* This set, consisting almost\nexclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had\nnothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to\ncertain women, and to the official side of the service. These\ngentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they\ndid not extend to many. From politeness and to start conversation,\nthey asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then\nthe talk went off into merry jests and gossip.\n\n\n*Ours.\n\n\n\"But the best of it was,\" said one, telling of the misfortune of a\nfellow diplomat, \"that the Chancellor told him flatly that his\nappointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.\nCan you fancy the figure he cut?...\"\n\n\"But the worst of it, gentlemen--I am giving Kuragin away to you--is\nthat that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking\nadvantage of it!\"\n\nPrince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over\nits arm. He began to laugh.\n\n\"Tell me about that!\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!\" cried several voices.\n\n\"You, Bolkonski, don\'t know,\" said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew,\n\"that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the\nRussian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing\namong the women!\"\n\n\"La femme est la compagne de l\'homme,\"* announced Prince\nHippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.\n\n\n*\"Woman is man\'s companion.\"\n\n\nBilibin and the rest of \"ours\" burst out laughing in Hippolyte\'s\nface, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom--he had to\nadmit--he had almost been jealous on his wife\'s account, was the\nbutt of this set.\n\n\"Oh, I must give you a treat,\" Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski.\n\"Kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics--you should see his\ngravity!\"\n\nHe sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began\ntalking to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered\nround these two.\n\n\"The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,\" began\nHippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, \"without\nexpressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless\nHis Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our\nalliance...\n\n\"Wait, I have not finished...\" he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him\nby the arm, \"I believe that intervention will be stronger than\nnonintervention. And...\" he paused. \"Finally one cannot impute the\nnonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.\"\nAnd he released Bolkonski\'s arm to indicate that he had now quite\nfinished.\n\n\"Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden\nmouth!\" said Bilibin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with\nsatisfaction.\n\nEverybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was\nevidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain\nthe wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.\n\n\"Well now, gentlemen,\" said Bilibin, \"Bolkonski is my guest in\nthis house and in Brunn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I\ncan, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it\nwould be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more\ndifficult, and I beg you all to help me. Brunn\'s attractions must be\nshown him. You can undertake the theater, I society, and you,\nHippolyte, of course the women.\"\n\n\"We must let him see Amelie, she\'s exquisite!\" said one of \"ours,\"\nkissing his finger tips.\n\n\"In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane\ninterests,\" said Bilibin.\n\n\"I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,\ngentlemen, it is already time for me to go,\" replied Prince Andrew\nlooking at his watch.\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"To the Emperor.\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, au revoir, Bolkonski! Au revoir, Prince! Come\nback early to dinner,\" cried several voices. \"We\'ll take you in hand.\"\n\n\"When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the\nway that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,\" said\nBilibin, accompanying him to the hall.\n\n\"I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,\nI can\'t,\" replied Bolkonski, smiling.\n\n\"Well, talk as much as you can, anyway.

But after it was over,\nthe adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed\nBolkonski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The\nEmperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room.\nBefore the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact\nthat the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to\nsay.\n\n\"Tell me, when did the battle begin?\" he asked hurriedly.\n\nPrince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:\n\"Was Kutuzov well? When had he left Krems?\" and so on. The Emperor\nspoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions--the\nanswers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest\nhim.\n\n\"At what o\'clock did the battle begin?\" asked the Emperor.\n\n\"I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o\'clock the battle began at\nthe front, but at Durrenstein, where I was, our attack began after\nfive in the afternoon,\" replied Bolkonski growing more animated and\nexpecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account,\nwhich he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen.

It\'s very sad, very sad!\"\n\nThe Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew\nwithdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides.\nEverywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday\'s\nadjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and\noffered him his own house. The Minister of War came up and\ncongratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which\nthe Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress\' chamberlain invited\nhim to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did\nnot know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts.\nThen the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the\nwindow, and began to talk to him.\n\nContrary to Bilibin\'s forecast the news he had brought was\njoyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutuzov was\nawarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army\nreceived rewards. Bolkonski was invited everywhere, and had to spend\nthe whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries.\nBetween four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls,\nhe was returning to Bilibin\'s house thinking out a letter to his\nfather about the battle and his visit to Brunn. At the door he found a\nvehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilibin\'s man, was dragging a\nportmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.\n\nBefore returning to Bilibin\'s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop\nto provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent\nsome time in the shop.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, your excellency!\" said Franz, with difficulty rolling the\nportmanteau into the vehicle, \"we are to move on still farther. The\nscoundrel is again at our heels!\"\n\n\"Eh? What?\" asked Prince Andrew.\n\nBilibin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed\nexcitement.\n\n\"There now! Confess that this is delightful,\" said he. \"This\naffair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without\nstriking a blow!\"\n\nPrince Andrew could not understand.\n\n\"But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the\ntown knows?\"\n\n\"I come from the archduchess\'. I heard nothing there.\"\n\n\"And you didn\'t see that everybody is packing up?\"\n\n\"I did not... What is it all about?\" inquired Prince Andrew\nimpatiently.\n\n\"What\'s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that\nAuersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat\nis now rushing along the road to Brunn and will be here in a day or\ntwo.\"\n\n\"What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was\nmined?\"\n\n\"That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.\"\n\nBolkonski shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It\nwill be cut off,\" said he.\n\n\"That\'s just it,\" answered Bilibin. \"Listen! The French entered\nVienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday,\nthose gentlemen, messieurs les marechaux,* Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,\nmount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)\n\'Gentlemen,\' says one of them, \'you know the Thabor Bridge is mined\nand doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its\nhead and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up\nthe bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign\nthe Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and\ntake it!\' \'Yes, let\'s!\' say the others. And off they go and take the\nbridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of\nthe Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.\"\n\n\n*The marshalls.\n\n\n\"Stop jesting,\" said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news\ngrieved him and yet he was pleased.\n\nAs soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless\nsituation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead\nit out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift\nhim from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to\nfame! Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching\nthe army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be\nthe only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be\nentrusted with the executing of the plan.\n\n\"Stop this jesting,\" he said\n\n\"I am not jesting,\" Bilibin went on. \"Nothing is truer or sadder.\nThese gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white\nhandkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the\nmarshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets\nthem enter the tete-de-pont.* They spin him a thousand gasconades,\nsaying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a\nmeeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg,\nand so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace\nthe officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French\nbattalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary\nmaterial into the water, and approaches the tete-de-pont. At length\nappears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von\nMautern himself. \'Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of\nthe Turkish wars Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another\'s\nhand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince\nAuersperg\'s acquaintance.\' In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed,\nso bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his\nrapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so\ndazzled by the sight of Murat\'s mantle and ostrich plumes, qu\'il n\'y\nvoit que du feu, et oublie celui qu\'il devait faire faire sur\nl\'ennemi!\"*[2] In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilibin did\nnot forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due\nappreciation. \"The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes\nthe guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,\" he went\non, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his\nown story, \"is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was\nto give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this\nsergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the\nbridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant,\nwho was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and\nsays: \'Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!\' Murat,\nseeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns\nto Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says:\n\'I don\'t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you\nallow a subordinate to address you like that!\' It was a stroke of\ngenius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the\nsergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair of the\nThabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor\nrascality....\"\n\n\n*Bridgehead.\n\n*[2] That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought\nto be firing at the enemy.\n\n\n\"It may be treachery,\" said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the\ngray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of\nfiring, and the glory that awaited him.\n\n\"Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,\" replied\nBilibin. \"It\'s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as\nat Ulm... it is...\"--he seemed to be trying to find the right\nexpression. \"C\'est... c\'est du Mack. Nous sommes mackes [It is... it\nis a bit of Mack. We are Macked],\" he concluded, feeling that he had\nproduced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His\nhitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a\nslight smile he began to examine his nails.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had\nrisen and was going toward his room.\n\n\"I am going away.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"To the army.\"\n\n\"But you meant to stay another two days?\"\n\n\"But now I am off at once.\"\n\nAnd Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went\nto his room.\n\n\"Do you know, mon cher,\" said Bilibin following him, \"I have been\nthinking about you. Why are you going?\"\n\nAnd in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles\nvanished from his face.\n\nPrince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.\n\n\"Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back\nto the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher,\nit is heroism!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the\nother side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the\ncontrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no\nlonger fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to return\nand have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and\ngo with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to\nOlmutz, and Olmutz is a very decent town. You and I will travel\ncomfortably in my caleche.\"\n\n\"Do stop joking, Bilibin,\" cried Bolkonski.\n\n\"I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are\nyou going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two\nthings,\" and the skin over his left temple puckered, \"either you\nwill not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will\nshare defeat and disgrace with Kutuzov\'s whole army.\"\n\nAnd Bilibin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was\ninsoluble.\n\n\"I cannot argue about it,\" replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he\nthought: \"I am going to save the army.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you are a hero!\" said Bilibin.');

Near Hetzelsdorf\nPrince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was\nmoving with great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was\nso obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a\ncarriage. Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack\ncommander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage\nwagons, rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own\nluggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him\nas he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly\nflight confirmed these rumors.\n\n\"Cette armee russe que l\'or de l\'Angleterre a transportee des\nextremites de l\'univers, nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme\nsort--(le sort de l\'armee d\'Ulm).\"* He remembered these words in\nBonaparte\'s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign,\nand they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a\nfeeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. \"And should there be\nnothing left but to die?\" he thought. \"Well, if need be, I shall do it\nno worse than others.\"\n\n\n*\"That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the\nearth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same fate--(the\nfate of the army at Ulm).\"\n\n\nHe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of\ndetachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and\nvehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy\nroad, three and sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and\nbefore, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels,\nthe creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the\ncrack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of\nsoldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road\nfallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and\nbroken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for\nsomething, and again soldiers straggling from their companies,\ncrowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from\nthem dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each ascent\nor descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of\nshouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud\npushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,\ntraces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers\ndirecting the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their\nvoices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their\nfaces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this\ndisorder.\n\n\"Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army,\" thought Bolkonski,\nrecalling Bilibin\'s words.\n\nWishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up\nto a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse\nvehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available\nmaterials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet,\nand a caleche. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in\nshawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle.\nPrince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier\nwhen his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the\nwoman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was beating\nthe soldier who was driving the woman\'s vehicle for trying to get\nahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of\nthe equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew\nshe leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from\nunder the woolen shawl, cried:\n\n\"Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven\'s sake... Protect\nme! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh\nChasseurs.... They won\'t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost\nour people...\"\n\n\"I\'ll flatten you into a pancake!\" shouted the angry officer to\nthe soldier. \"Turn back with your slut!\"\n\n\"Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?\" screamed\nthe doctor\'s wife.\n\n\"Kindly let this cart pass. Don\'t you see it\'s a woman?\" said Prince\nAndrew riding up to the officer.\n\nThe officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the\nsoldier. \"I\'ll teach you to push on!... Back!\"\n\n\"Let them pass, I tell you!\" repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his\nlips.\n\n\"And who are you?\" cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy\nrage, \"who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander\nhere, not you! Go back or I\'ll flatten you into a pancake,\" repeated\nhe. This expression evidently pleased him.\n\n\"That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,\" came a voice\nfrom behind.\n\nPrince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,\ntipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his\nchampionship of the doctor\'s wife in her queer trap might expose him\nto what he dreaded more than anything in the world--to ridicule; but\nhis instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence\nPrince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised\nhis riding whip.\n\n\"Kind...ly let--them--pass!\"\n\nThe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.\n\n\"It\'s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there\'s\nthis disorder,\" he muttered. \"Do as you like.\"\n\nPrince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the\ndoctor\'s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a\nsense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he\ngalloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in\nchief was.\n\nOn reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,\nintending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to\nsort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his\nmind. \"This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,\" he was thinking\nas he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar\nvoice called him by name.\n\nHe turned round. Nesvitski\'s handsome face looked out of the\nlittle window. Nesvitski, moving his moist lips as he chewed\nsomething, and flourishing his arm, called him to enter.\n\n\"Bolkonski! Bolkonski!... Don\'t you hear? Eh? Come quick...\" he\nshouted.\n\nEntering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvitski and another adjutant\nhaving something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he\nhad any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.\nThis was particularly noticeable on Nesvitski\'s usually laughing\ncountenance.\n\n\"Where is the commander in chief?\" asked Bolkonski.\n\n\"Here, in that house,\" answered the adjutant.\n\n\"Well, is it true that it\'s peace and capitulation?\" asked\nNesvitski.\n\n\"I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I\ncould do to get here.\"\n\n\"And we, my dear boy! It\'s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,\nwe\'re getting it still worse,\" said Nesvitski. \"But sit down and\nhave something to eat.\"\n\n\"You won\'t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,\nPrince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,\" said the other\nadjutant.\n\n\"Where are headquarters?\"\n\n\"We are to spend the night in Znaim.\"\n\n\"Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,\" said\nNesvitski. \"They\'ve made up splendid packs for me--fit to cross the\nBohemian mountains with. It\'s a bad lookout, old fellow! But what\'s\nthe matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,\" he added,\nnoticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.\n\n\"It\'s nothing,\" replied Prince Andrew.\n\nHe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor\'s wife\nand the convoy officer.\n\n\"What is the commander in chief doing here?\" he asked.\n\n\"I can\'t make out at all,\" said Nesvitski.\n\n\"Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable,\nabominable, quite abominable!\" said Prince Andrew, and he went off\nto the house where the commander in chief was.\n\nPassing by Kutuzov\'s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his\nsuite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince\nAndrew entered the passage. Kutuzov himself, he was told, was in the\nhouse with Prince Bagration and Weyrother. Weyrother was the\nAustrian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little\nKozlovski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk,\nwith cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom\nupwards. Kozlovski\'s face looked worn--he too had evidently not\nslept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to\nhim.\n\n\"Second line... have you written it?\" he continued dictating to\nthe clerk. \"The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...\"\n\n\"One can\'t write so fast, your honor,\" said the clerk, glancing\nangrily and disrespectfully at Kozlovski.\n\nThrough the door came the sounds of Kutuzov\'s voice, excited and\ndissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the\nsound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlovski looked at him,\nthe disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the\nclerk and Kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to\nthe commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks\nholding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that\nsomething important and disastrous was about to happen.\n\nHe turned to Kozlovski with urgent questions.\n\n\"Immediately, Prince,\" said Kozlovski. \"Dispositions for Bagration.\"\n\n\"What about capitulation?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.\"\n\nPrince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.\nJust as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened,\nand Kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the\ndoorway. Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutuzov but the\nexpression of the commander in chief\'s one sound eye showed him to\nbe so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of\nhis presence. He looked straight at his adjutant\'s face without\nrecognizing him.\n\n\"Well, have you finished?\" said he to Kozlovski.\n\n\"One moment, your excellency.\"\n\nBagration, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,\nimpassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in\nchief.\n\n\"I have the honor to present myself,\" repeated Prince Andrew\nrather loudly, handing Kutuzov an envelope.\n\n\"Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!\"\n\nKutuzov went out into the porch with Bagration.\n\n\"Well, good-by, Prince,\" said he to Bagration. \"My blessing, and may\nChrist be with you in your great endeavor!\"\n\nHis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his\nleft hand he drew Bagration toward him, and with his right, on which\nhe wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a\ngesture evidently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagration\nkissed him on the neck instead.\n\n\"Christ be with you!\" Kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage.\n\"Get in with me,\" said he to Bolkonski.\n\n\"Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to\nremain with Prince Bagration\'s detachment.\"\n\n\"Get in,\" said Kutuzov, and noticing that Bolkonski still delayed,\nhe added: \"I need good officers myself, need them myself!\"\n\nThey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.\n\n\"There is still much, much before us,\" he said, as if with an old\nman\'s penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkonski\'s\nmind. \"If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,\"\nhe added as if speaking to himself.\n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Kutuzov\'s face only a foot distant from him\nand involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar\nnear his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the\nempty eye socket. \"Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those\nmen\'s death,\" thought Bolkonski.\n\n\"That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,\" he said.\n\nKutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had\nbeen saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently\nswaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince\nAndrew. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With\ndelicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his\ninterview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court\nconcerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK TWO: 1805: CHAPTER XIV','On November 1 Kutuzov had received, through a spy, news that the\narmy he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported\nthat the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing\nin immense force upon Kutuzov\'s line of communication with the\ntroops that were arriving from Russia. If Kutuzov decided to remain at\nKrems, Napoleon\'s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut\nhim off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty\nthousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If\nKutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops\narriving from Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown\nparts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior\nforces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with\nBuxhowden. If Kutuzov decided to retreat along the road from Krems\nto Olmutz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked\nbeing forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the\nVienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having\nto accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as\nstrong, who would hem him in from two sides.\n\nKutuzov chose this latter course.\n\nThe French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were\nadvancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles\noff on the line of Kutuzov\'s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the\nFrench, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the\nFrench forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army\nto a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to\nforestall the French with his whole army was impossible. The road\nfor the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the\nroad for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.\n\nThe night he received the news, Kutuzov sent Bagration\'s vanguard,\nfour thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the\nKrems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march\nwithout resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and\nif he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as\nlong as possible. Kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road\nto Znaim.\n\nMarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills,\nwith his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as\nstragglers by the way, Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim road\nat Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching\nHollabrunn from Vienna. Kutuzov with his transport had still to\nmarch for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration\nwith his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain\nfor days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrunn,\nwhich was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the\nimpossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the\nVienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat\nto try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagration\'s weak\ndetachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzov\'s whole\narmy. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of\nthe rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with\nthis object offered a three days\' truce on condition that both\narmies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that\nnegotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he\ntherefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count\nNostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed\nMurat\'s emissary and retired, leaving Bagration\'s division exposed.\nAnother emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace\nnegotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days\' truce.\nBagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or\nrefuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to report the offer he\nhad received.\n\nA truce was Kutuzov\'s sole chance of gaining time, giving\nBagration\'s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport\nand heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French)\nadvance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the\nonly, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On\nreceiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General\nWintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp.\nWintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer\nterms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants back\nto hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the\nentire army along the Krems-Znaim road. Bagration\'s exhausted and\nhungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the\ntransport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of\nan enemy eight times as strong as itself.\n\nKutuzov\'s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which\nwere in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to\npass, and also that Murat\'s mistake would very soon be discovered,\nproved correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schonbrunn, sixteen\nmiles from Hollabrunn) received Murat\'s dispatch with the proposal\nof a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the\nfollowing letter to Murat:\n\n\nSchonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,\n\nat eight o\'clock in the morning\n\nTo PRINCE MURAT,\n\nI cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command\nonly my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice\nwithout my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign.\nBreak the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him\nthat the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so,\nand that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.\n\nIf, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I\nwill ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the\nRussian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and\nartillery.\n\nThe Russian Emperor\'s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are\nnothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The\nAustrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna\nbridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of\nthe Emperor.\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n\nBonaparte\'s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to\nMurat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all\nthe Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim\nescape, and Bagration\'s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,\ndried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first\ntime for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was\nin store for him.');

Bonaparte\'s adjutant had not yet\nreached Murat\'s detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In\nBagration\'s detachment no one knew anything of the general position of\naffairs. They talked of peace but did not believe in its\npossibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the\nnearness of an engagement. Bagration, knowing Bolkonski to be a\nfavorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and\nspecial marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be\nan engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to\nremain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an\neye on the order of retreat, \"which is also very important.\"\n\n\"However, there will hardly be an engagement today,\" said\nBagration as if to reassure Prince Andrew.\n\n\"If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a\nmedal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he\nwishes to stay with me, let him... he\'ll be of use here if he\'s a\nbrave officer,\" thought Bagration. Prince Andrew, without replying,\nasked the prince\'s permission to ride round the position to see the\ndisposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be\nsent to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly\ndressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of\nspeaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince\nAndrew.\n\nOn all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who\nseemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors,\nbenches, and fencing from the village.\n\n\"There now, Prince! We can\'t stop those fellows,\" said the staff\nofficer pointing to the soldiers. \"The officers don\'t keep them in\nhand. And there,\" he pointed to a sutler\'s tent, \"they crowd in and\nsit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, it\'s full again.\nI must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won\'t take a\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Yes, let\'s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,\"\nsaid Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.\n\n\"Why didn\'t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you\nsomething.\"\n\nThey dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed\nand weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.\n\n\"Now what does this mean, gentlemen?\" said the staff officer, in the\nreproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than\nonce. \"You know it won\'t do to leave your posts like this. The\nprince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,\nCaptain,\" and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer\nwho without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to\ndry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not\naltogether comfortably.\n\n\"Well, aren\'t you ashamed of yourself, Captain Tushin?\" he\ncontinued. \"One would think that as an artillery officer you would set\na good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be\nsounded and you\'ll be in a pretty position without your boots!\" (The\nstaff officer smiled.) \"Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of\nyou, all!\" he added in a tone of command.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery\nofficer Tushin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged\nfoot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent,\nkindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.\n\n\"The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,\" said Captain\nTushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently\nwishing to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt\nthat his jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.\n\n\"Kindly return to your posts,\" said the staff officer trying to\npreserve his gravity.\n\nPrince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer\'s small figure.\nThere was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather\ncomic, but extremely attractive.\n\nThe staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode\non.\n\nHaving ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking\nsoldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left\nsome entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which\nshowed up red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt\nsleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host\nof white ants; spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown\nup from behind the bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer\nrode up, looked at the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it\nthey came upon some dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by\nothers, who ran from the entrenchment. They had to hold their noses\nand put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned\natmosphere of these latrines.\n\n\"Voila l\'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince,\"* said the staff\nofficer.\n\n\n*\"This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.\"\n\n\nThey rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could\nalready be seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the\nposition.\n\n\"That\'s our battery,\" said the staff officer indicating the\nhighest point. \"It\'s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without\nhis boots. You can see everything from there; let\'s go there, Prince.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, I will go on alone,\" said Prince Andrew,\nwishing to rid himself of this staff officer\'s company, \"please\ndon\'t trouble yourself further.\"\n\nThe staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.\n\nThe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly\nand cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had\nbeen in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road\nseven miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and\nalarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French\nlines the more confident was the appearance of our troops. The\nsoldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major\nand company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in\neach section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers\nscattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and\nwere building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the\nfires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg\nbands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and\nporridge cookers. In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers\nwere gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample,\nwhich a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an\nofficer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted.\n\nAnother company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,\ncrowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who,\ntilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to\nhim. The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with\nreverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths,\nand walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions,\nlicking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats.\nAll their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home\nawaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before\nan action in which at least half of them would be left on the field.\nAfter passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev\ngrenadiers--fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs--near\nthe shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different\nfrom the others, Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of\ngrenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while\ntwo others were flourishing their switches and striking him\nregularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout\nmajor was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams\nkept repeating:\n\n\"It\'s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,\nhonorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor\nin him, he\'s a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!\"\n\nSo the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but\nunnatural screams, continued.\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" said the major.\n\nA young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his\nface stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the\nadjutant as he rode by.\n\nPrince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our\nfront line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and\nleft flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce\nhad passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the\nmen could see one another\'s faces and speak to one another. Besides\nthe soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, there were\nmany curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared at their\nstrange foreign enemies.\n\nSince early morning--despite an injunction not to approach the\npicket line--the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away.\nThe soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a\ncuriosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the\nsight-seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew\nhalted to have a look at the French.\n\n\"Look! Look there!\" one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a\nRussian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer\nand was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. \"Hark\nto him jabbering! Fine, isn\'t it? It\'s all the Frenchy can do to\nkeep up with him. There now, Sidorov!\"\n\n\"Wait a bit and listen. It\'s fine!\" answered Sidorov, who was\nconsidered an adept at French.\n\nThe soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov. Prince\nAndrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying.\nDolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was\nstationed, with his captain.\n\n\"Now then, go on, go on!\" incited the officer, bending forward and\ntrying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible\nto him. \"More, please: more! What\'s he saying?\"\n\nDolokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot\ndispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about\nthe campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the\nRussians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and\nhad fled all the way from Ulm, while Dolokhov maintained that the\nRussians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.\n\n\"We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you\noff,\" said Dolokhov.\n\n\"Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!\" said\nthe French grenadier.\n\nThe French onlookers and listeners laughed.\n\n\"We\'ll make you dance as we did under Suvorov...,\"* said Dolokhov.\n\n\n*\"On vous fera danser.\"\n\n\n\"Qu\' est-ce qu\'il chante?\"* asked a Frenchman.\n\n\n*\"What\'s he singing about?\"\n\n\n\"It\'s ancient history,\" said another, guessing that it referred to a\nformer war. \"The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the\nothers...\"\n\n\"Bonaparte...\" began Dolokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.\n\n\"Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacre nom...!\" cried he angrily.\n\n\"The devil skin your Emperor.\"\n\nAnd Dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldier\'s Russian and\nshouldering his musket walked away.\n\n\"Let us go, Ivan Lukich,\" he said to the captain.\n\n\"Ah, that\'s the way to talk French,\" said the picket soldiers. \"Now,\nSidorov, you have a try!\"\n\nSidorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber\nmeaningless sounds very fast: \"Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter,\nKaska,\" he said, trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.\n\n\"Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!\" came peals of such healthy and\ngood-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French\ninvoluntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be\nto unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as\nquickly as possible.\n\nBut the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and\nentrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon\nconfronted one another as before.');

Here he\ndismounted, and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered\ncannon. Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he\nstood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his\nmeasured, monotonous pacing. Behind the guns were their limbers and\nstill farther back picket ropes and artillerymen\'s bonfires. To the\nleft, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed\nwattle shed from which came the sound of officers\' voices in eager\nconversation.\n\nIt was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and\nthe greater part of the enemy\'s opened out from this battery. Just\nfacing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schon\nGrabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the\nFrench troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of\nwhom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To\nthe left from that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a\nbattery, but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye.\nOur right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated\nthe French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the\nfarthest point the dragoons. In the center, where Tushin\'s battery\nstood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the\neasiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating\nus from Schon Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse,\nin which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood.\nThe French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they\ncould easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a\nsteep and deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to\nretire. Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the\ncannon, sketched a plan of the position. He made some notes on two\npoints, intending to mention them to Bagration. His idea was, first,\nto concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to\nwithdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew,\nbeing always near the commander in chief, closely following the mass\nmovements and general orders, and constantly studying historical\naccounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the course of\nevents in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined only\nimportant possibilities: \"If the enemy attacks the right flank,\" he\nsaid to himself, \"the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must\nhold their position till reserves from the center come up. In that\ncase the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack. If\nthey attack our center we, having the center battery on this high\nground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat\nto the dip by echelons.\" So he reasoned.... All the time he had been\nbeside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly,\nbut as often happens had not understood a word of what they were\nsaying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the\nshed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.\n\n\"No, friend,\" said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew,\na familiar voice, \"what I say is that if it were possible to know what\nis beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That\'s so, friend.\"\n\nAnother, a younger voice, interrupted him: \"Afraid or not, you can\'t\nescape it anyhow.\"\n\n\"All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,\" said a third\nmanly voice interrupting them both. \"Of course you artillery men are\nvery wise, because you can take everything along with you--vodka and\nsnacks.\"\n\nAnd the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,\nlaughed.\n\n\"Yes, one is afraid,\" continued the first speaker, he of the\nfamiliar voice. \"One is afraid of the unknown, that\'s what it is.\nWhatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there\nis no sky but only an atmosphere.\"\n\nThe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.\n\n\"Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin,\" it said.\n\n\"Why,\" thought Prince Andrew, \"that\'s the captain who stood up in\nthe sutler\'s hut without his boots.\" He recognized the agreeable,\nphilosophizing voice with pleasure.\n\n\"Some herb vodka? Certainly!\" said Tushin. \"But still, to conceive a\nfuture life...\"\n\nHe did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air;\nnearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon\nball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded\ninto the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing up a\nmass of earth. The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.\n\nAnd immediately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth\nand his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed\nfollowed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer\nwho hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.');

His eyes\nran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto\nmotionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a\nbattery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two\nmounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A\nsmall but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,\nprobably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had\nnot yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a\nreport. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and\ngalloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagration. He heard the\ncannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our\nguns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the\nparleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.\n\nLemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte\'s stern\nletter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at\nonce moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the\nRussian wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the\nEmperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.\n\n\"It has begun. Here it is!\" thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood\nrush to his heart. \"But where and how will my Toulon present itself?\"\n\nPassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and\ndrinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same\nrapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets\nready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that\nfilled his heart. \"It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but\nenjoyable!\" was what the face of each soldier and each officer\nseemed to say.\n\nBefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up,\nhe saw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming\ntoward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and\nriding a white horse, was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrew stopped,\nwaiting for him to come up; Prince Bagration reined in his horse and\nrecognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while\nPrince Andrew told him what he had seen.\n\nThe feeling, \"It has begun! Here it is!\" was seen even on Prince\nBagration\'s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.\nPrince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face\nand wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking\nand feeling at that moment. \"Is there anything at all behind that\nimpassive face?\" Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince\nBagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew\ntold him, and said, \"Very good!\" in a tone that seemed to imply that\neverything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he\nhad foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride,\nspoke quickly. Prince Bagration, uttering his words with an Oriental\naccent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that\nthere was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the\ndirection of Tushin\'s battery. Prince Andrew followed with the\nsuite. Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, the\nprince\'s personal adjutant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff\nofficer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian--an\naccountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of\ncuriosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around\nhim with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange\nappearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet\ncoat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer\'s saddle.\n\n\"He wants to see a battle,\" said Zherkov to Bolkonski, pointing to\nthe accountant, \"but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach\nalready.\"\n\n\"Oh, leave off!\" said the accountant with a beaming but rather\ncunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of\nZherkov\'s joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really\nwas.\n\n\"It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,\" said the staff officer.\n(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing\na prince, but could not get it quite right.)\n\nBy this time they were all approaching Tushin\'s battery, and a\nball struck the ground in front of them.\n\n\"What\'s that that has fallen?\" asked the accountant with a naive\nsmile.\n\n\"A French pancake,\" answered Zherkov.\n\n\"So that\'s what they hit with?\" asked the accountant. \"How awful!\"\n\nHe seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished\nspeaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which\nsuddenly ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a\nCossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant,\ncrashed to earth with his horse. Zherkov and the staff officer bent\nover their saddles and turned their horses away. The accountant\nstopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with attentive\ncuriosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.\n\nPrince Bagration screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing\nthe cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to\nsay, \"Is it worth while noticing trifles?\" He reined in his horse with\nthe case of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged\nhis saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber\nof a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story\nof Suvorov giving his saber to Bagration in Italy, and the\nrecollection was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had\nreached the battery at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined\nthe battlefield.\n\n\"Whose company?\" asked Prince Bagration of an artilleryman\nstanding by the ammunition wagon.\n\nHe asked, \"Whose company?\" but he really meant, \"Are you\nfrightened here?\" and the artilleryman understood him.\n\n\"Captain Tushin\'s, your excellency!\" shouted the red-haired,\nfreckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" muttered Bagration as if considering something, and he\nrode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.\n\nAs he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and\nhis suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they\ncould see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly\nback to its former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number\nOne, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while\nNumber Two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon\'s\nmouth. The short, round-shouldered Captain Tushin, stumbling over\nthe tail of the gun carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the\ngeneral, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.\n\n\"Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,\" cried he in a\nfeeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill suited to\nhis weak figure. \"Number Two!\" he squeaked. \"Fire, Medvedev!\"\n\nBagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three fingers to his\ncap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military\nsalute but like a priest\'s benediction, approached the general. Though\nTushin\'s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing\nincendiary balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just\nopposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.\n\nNo one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire, but\nafter consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchenko, for whom he had\ngreat respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set\nfire to the village. \"Very good!\" said Bagration in reply to the\nofficer\'s report, and began deliberately to examine the whole\nbattlefield extended before him. The French had advanced nearest on\nour right. Below the height on which the Kiev regiment was\nstationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring\nrolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther to the\nright beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to\nBagration a French column that was outflanking us. To the left the\nhorizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagration ordered two\nbattalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank.\nThe officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if\nthese battalions went away, the guns would remain without support.\nPrince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked\nat him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer\'s\nremark was just and that really no answer could be made to it. But\nat that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the\ncommander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses\nof the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was\nin disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince\nBagration bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off\nat a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with\norders to attack the French. But this adjutant returned half an hour\nlater with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already\nretreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been\nopened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened\nto throw some sharpshooters into the wood.\n\n\"Very good!\" said Bagration.\n\nAs he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also,\nand as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go\nthere himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in\ncommand (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzov at\nBraunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow\nin the rear, as the right flank would probably not be able to\nwithstand the enemy\'s attack very long. About Tushin and the battalion\nthat had been in support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince\nAndrew listened attentively to Bagration\'s colloquies with the\ncommanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his\nsurprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince\nBagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity,\nby accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not\nby his direct command, at least in accord with his intentions.\nPrince Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to\nchance and was independent of the commander\'s will, owing to the\ntact Bagration showed, his presence was very valuable. Officers who\napproached him with disturbed countenances became calm; soldiers and\nofficers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and\nwere evidently anxious to display their courage before him.');

The nearer\nthey got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they\nfelt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet\nwounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged\nalong by two soldiers who supported him under the arms. There was a\ngurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently\nhit him in the throat or mouth. Another was walking sturdily by\nhimself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm\nwhich had just been hurt, while blood from it was streaming over his\ngreatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been wounded and his\nface showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended\na steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met\na crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers were\nascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general\'s\npresence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them\nrows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an\nofficer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of\nretreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagration rode up to the\nranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning\nthe sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked\nwith smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with\nit. Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the\ntouchpans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were\nfiring, though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke\nwhich there was no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and\nwhistling of bullets were often heard. \"What is this?\" thought\nPrince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. \"It can\'t be an\nattack, for they are not moving; it can\'t be a square--for they are\nnot drawn up for that.\"\n\nThe commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a\npleasant smile--his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,\ngiving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as\na host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had\nbeen attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been\nrepulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack had\nbeen repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had\noccurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know\nwhat had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to\nhim, and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been\nrepulsed or his regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at\nthe commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all\nover his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had\nshouted \"Cavalry!\" and our men had begun firing. They were still\nfiring, not at the cavalry which had disappeared, but at French\ninfantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men.\nPrince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what\nhe had desired and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to\nbring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had\njust passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on\nPrince Bagration\'s face at this moment. It expressed the\nconcentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who\non a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water. The\ndull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of\nprofound thought. The round, steady, hawk\'s eyes looked before him\neagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although\nhis movements were still slow and measured.\n\nThe commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration, entreating\nhim to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.\n\"Please, your excellency, for God\'s sake!\" he kept saying, glancing\nfor support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him.\n\"There, you see!\" and he drew attention to the bullets whistling,\nsinging, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the tone\nof entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who\nhas picked up an ax: \"We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister\nyour hands.\" He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and\nhis half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words.\nThe staff officer joined in the colonel\'s appeals, but Bagration did\nnot reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to\ngive room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking,\nthe curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising\nwind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible\nhand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving about on it,\nopened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French\ncolumn advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground.\nOne could already see the soldiers\' shaggy caps, distinguish the\nofficers from the men, and see the standard flapping against its\nstaff.\n\n\"They march splendidly,\" remarked someone in Bagration\'s suite.\n\nThe head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The\nclash would take place on this side of it...\n\nThe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly\nformed up and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the\nlaggards, came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order.\nBefore they had reached Bagration, the weighty tread of the mass of\nmen marching in step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to\nBagration, marched a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a\nstupid and happy expression--the same man who had rushed out of the\nwattle shed. At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how\ndashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander.\n\nWith the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly\nwith his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to\nhis full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with\nthe heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He\ncarried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and\nnot like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and\nnow back at the men without losing step, his whole powerful body\nturning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of his soul were\nconcentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and\nfeeling that he was doing it well he was happy. \"Left... left...\nleft...\" he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in\ntime to this, with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers\nburdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of\nthese hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each\nalternate step, \"Left... left... left...\" A fat major skirted a\nbush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen\nbehind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot,\npanting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the air,\nflew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fell into the\ncolumn to the measure of \"Left... left!\" \"Close up!\" came the\ncompany commander\'s voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a\nsemicircle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old\ntrooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside\nthe dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a\nhop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the\nregular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear\nleft... left... left.\n\n\"Well done, lads!\" said Prince Bagration.\n\n\"Glad to do our best, your ex\'len-lency!\" came a confused shout from\nthe ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on\nBagration as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: \"We\nknow that ourselves!\" Another, without looking round, as though\nfearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.\n\nThe order was given to halt and down knapsacks.\n\nBagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and\ndismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over\nhis felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The\nhead of the French column, with its officers leading, appeared from\nbelow the hill.\n\n\"Forward, with God!\" said Bagration, in a resolute, sonorous\nvoice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging\nhis arms, he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the\nawkward gait of a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible\npower was leading him forward, and experienced great happiness.\n\nThe French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside\nBagration, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets,\nand even their faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who,\nwith gaitered legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with\ndifficulty.) Prince Bagration gave no further orders and silently\ncontinued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after\nanother rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their\nuneven ranks, and musket shots sounded.

But at the moment the first report was heard,\nBagration looked round and shouted, \"Hurrah!\"\n\n\"Hurrah--ah!--ah!\" rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and\npassing Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular\nbut joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.');

In the center Tushin\'s forgotten battery, which had managed\nto set fire to the Schon Grabern village, delayed the French\nadvance. The French were putting out the fire which the wind was\nspreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the\ncenter to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was\nhurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed.\nBut our left--which consisted of the Azov and Podolsk infantry and the\nPavlograd hussars--was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by\nsuperior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion.\nBagration had sent Zherkov to the general commanding that left flank\nwith orders to retreat immediately.\n\nZherkov, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse\nabout and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagration than his\ncourage failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it\nwas dangerous.\n\nHaving reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where\nthe firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where\nthey could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.\n\nThe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander\nof the regiment Kutuzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which\nDolokhov was serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left\nflank had been assigned to the commander of the Pavlograd regiment\nin which Rostov was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two\ncommanders were much exasperated with one another and, long after\nthe action had begun on the right flank and the French were already\nadvancing, were engaged in discussion with the sole object of\noffending one another. But the regiments, both cavalry and infantry,\nwere by no means ready for the impending action. From privates to\ngeneral they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in\npeaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the horses and the\ninfantry collecting wood.\n\n\"He higher iss dan I in rank,\" said the German colonel of the\nhussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, \"so\nlet him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars...\nBugler, sount ze retreat!\"\n\nBut haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling\ntogether, thundered on the right and in the center, while the\ncapotes of Lannes\' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the\nmilldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The\ngeneral in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky\nsteps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and\nrode to the Pavlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows\nbut with secret malevolence in their hearts.\n\n\"Once again, Colonel,\" said the general, \"I can\'t leave half my\nmen in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,\" he repeated, \"to\noccupy the position and prepare for an attack.\"\n\n\"I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!\"\nsuddenly replied the irate colonel. \"If you vere in the cavalry...\"\n\n\"I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if\nyou are not aware of the fact...\"\n\n\"Quite avare, your excellency,\" suddenly shouted the colonel,\ntouching his horse and turning purple in the face. \"Vill you be so\ngoot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don\'t\nvish to destroy my men for your pleasure!\"\n\n\"You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own\npleasure and I won\'t allow it to be said!\"\n\nTaking the colonel\'s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the\ngeneral expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front\nline, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the\nbullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and\nthey halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the\nline, for from where they had been before it had been evident that\nit was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken\nground, as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The\ngeneral and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another\nlike two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to\ndetect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination\nsuccessfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give\noccasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave\nthe range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time\ntesting each other\'s courage had it not been that just then they heard\nthe rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the\nwood. The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It\nwas no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry.\nThey were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the\nFrench. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to\nattack in order to cut away through for themselves.\n\nThe squadron in which Rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount\nbefore it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,\nthere was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that\nterrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear--resembling the line\nseparating the living from the dead--lay between them. All were\nconscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would\ncross it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.\n\nThe colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to\nquestions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately\ninsisting on having his own way, gave an order. No one said anything\ndefinite, but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron.\nThe command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were\ndrawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The troops of the left\nflank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did not\nhimself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated itself\nto the men.\n\n\"If only they would be quick!\" thought Rostov, feeling that at\nlast the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which\nhe had so often heard from his fellow hussars.\n\n\"Fo\'ward, with God, lads!\" rang out Denisov\'s voice. \"At a twot\nfo\'ward!\"\n\nThe horses\' croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at\nthe reins and started of his own accord.\n\nBefore him, on the right, Rostov saw the front lines of his\nhussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see\ndistinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some\nway off.\n\n\"Faster!\" came the word of command, and Rostov felt Rook\'s flanks\ndrooping as he broke into a gallop.\n\nRostov anticipated his horse\'s movements and became more and more\nelated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had\nbeen in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible--and now he\nhad crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but\neverything was becoming more and more happy and animated. \"Oh, how I\nwill slash at him!\" thought Rostov, gripping the hilt of his saber.\n\n\"Hur-a-a-a-ah!\" came a roar of voices. \"Let anyone come my way now,\"\nthought Rostov driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a\nfull gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was\nalready visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep\nover the squadron. Rostov raised his saber, ready to strike, but at\nthat instant the trooper Nikitenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away\nfrom him, and Rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be\ncarried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same\nspot. From behind him Bondarchuk, an hussar he knew, jolted against\nhim and looked angrily at him. Bondarchuk\'s horse swerved and galloped\npast.\n\n\"How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!\" Rostov\nasked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle\nof a field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars\' backs, he saw\nnothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around\nhim. There was warm blood under his arm. \"No, I am wounded and the\nhorse is killed.\" Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back,\npinning his rider\'s leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled\nbut could not rise. Rostov also tried to rise but fell back, his\nsabretache having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men\nwere, and where the French, he did not know. There was no one near.\n\nHaving disentangled his leg, he rose. \"Where, on which side, was now\nthe line that had so sharply divided the two armies?\" he asked himself\nand could not answer. \"Can something bad have happened to me?\" he\nwondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something\nsuperfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if\nit were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find\nblood on it. \"Ah, here are people coming,\" he thought joyfully, seeing\nsome men running toward him. \"They will help me!\" In front came a\nman wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,\nand with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running\nbehind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among\nthe hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar.\nHe was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.\n\n\"It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will\ntake me too? Who are these men?\" thought Rostov, scarcely believing\nhis eyes. \"Can they be French?\" He looked at the approaching\nFrenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get\nat them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful\nthat he could not believe his eyes. \"Who are they? Why are they\nrunning? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom\neveryone is so fond of?\" He remembered his mother\'s love for him,\nand his family\'s, and his friends\', and the enemy\'s intention to\nkill him seemed impossible. \"But perhaps they may do it!\" For more\nthan ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the\nsituation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was\nalready so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And\nthe excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding\nhis breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostov. He seized his\npistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran\nwith all his might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the\nfeeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns\nbridge, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One\nsingle sentiment, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed\nhis whole being. Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field\nwith the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then\nturning his good-natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder\nof terror went through him: \"No, better not look,\" he thought, but\nhaving reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had\nfallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed his\nrun to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade\nfarther back. Rostov paused. \"No, there\'s some mistake,\" thought he.\n\"They can\'t have wanted to kill me.\" But at the same time, his left\narm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He\ncould run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov\nclosed his eyes and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled\npast him. He mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his\nleft hand with his right, and reached the bushes. Behind these were\nsome Russian sharpshooters.');

One soldier, in his\nfear, uttered the senseless cry, \"Cut off!\" that is so terrible in\nbattle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of\npanic.\n\n\"Surrounded! Cut off? We\'re lost!\" shouted the fugitives.\n\nThe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the\ngeneral realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment,\nand the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years\' service\nwho had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters\nfor negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the\nrecalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and\nabove all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for\nself-preservation, he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring\nhis horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell\naround, but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to know what\nwas happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he\nhad made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years\'\nservice, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.\n\nHaving galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind\nthe copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and\ndescending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides\nthe fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of\nsoldiers attend to the voice of their commander, or would they,\ndisregarding him, continue their flight? Despite his desperate\nshouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his\nfurious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former\nself, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued\nto run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders. The moral\nhesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating\nin a panic.\n\nThe general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the\npowder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at\nthat moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any\napparent reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and\nRussian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was\nTimokhin\'s company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood\nand, having lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French\nunexpectedly. Timokhin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the\nenemy with such a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination\nthat, taken by surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets\nand run. Dolokhov, running beside Timokhin, killed a Frenchman at\nclose quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French\nofficer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the battalions\nre-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half\nwere for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to join\nup, and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major\nEkonomov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies\npass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the\ncommander\'s stirrup, almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a\nbluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was\nbandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung.\nHe had an officer\'s sword in his hand. The soldier was pale, his\nblue eyes looked impudently into the commander\'s face, and his lips\nwere smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving instructions\nto Major Ekonomov, he could not help taking notice of the soldier.\n\n\"Your excellency, here are two trophies,\" said Dolokhov, pointing to\nthe French sword and pouch. \"I have taken an officer prisoner. I\nstopped the company.\" Dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and\nspoke in abrupt sentences. \"The whole company can bear witness. I\nbeg you will remember this, your excellency!\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" replied the commander, and turned to Major\nEkonomov.\n\nBut Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around\nhis head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.\n\n\"A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your\nexcellency!\"\n\n\nTushin\'s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the\naction did Prince Bagration, still hearing the cannonade in the\ncenter, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also,\nto order the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the\nsupports attached to Tushin\'s battery had been moved away in the\nmiddle of the action by someone\'s order, the battery had continued\nfiring and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could\nnot surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing\nfrom four quite undefended guns. On the contrary, the energetic action\nof that battery led the French to suppose that here--in the\ncenter--the main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had\nattempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven\nback by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.\n\nSoon after Prince Bagration had left him, Tushin had succeeded in\nsetting fire to Schon Grabern.\n\n\"Look at them scurrying! It\'s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine!\nGrand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!\" exclaimed the artillerymen,\nbrightening up.\n\nAll the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the\ndirection of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the\nsoldiers cried at each shot: \"Fine! That\'s good! Look at it... Grand!\"\nThe fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French\ncolumns that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as\nthough in revenge for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the\nright of the village and began firing them at Tushin\'s battery.\n\nIn their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in\nsuccessfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed\nthis battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our\nguns, one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a\nmunition-wagon driver\'s leg. Their spirits once roused were,\nhowever, not diminished, but only changed character. The horses were\nreplaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded were\ncarried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun\nbattery. Tushin\'s companion officer had been killed at the beginning\nof the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the\nguns\' crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still as\nmerry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing\nbelow them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.\n\nLittle Tushin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly\nto \"refill my pipe for that one!\" and then, scattering sparks from it,\nran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the\nFrench.\n\n\"Smack at \'em, lads!\" he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels\nand working the screws himself.\n\nAmid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always\nmade him jump, Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from\ngun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders\nabout replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones,\nand shouting in his feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute.\nHis face grew more and more animated. Only when a man was killed or\nwounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at\nthe men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting the\ninjured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and,\nas is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders\ntaller and twice as broad as their officer--all looked at their\ncommander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the\nexpression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs.\n\nOwing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and\nactivity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense\nof fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded\nnever occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more\nelated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a\nday, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and\nthat the corner of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar\nground. Though he thought of everything, considered everything, and\ndid everything the best of officers could do in his position, he was\nin a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness.\n\nFrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle\nand thud of the enemy\'s cannon balls, from the flushed and\nperspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight\nof the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on\nthe enemy\'s side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking\nthe earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these\nthings a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his\nbrain and at that moment afforded him pleasure. The enemy\'s guns\nwere in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs\nwere blown by an invisible smoker.\n\n\"There... he\'s puffing again,\" muttered Tushin to himself, as a\nsmall cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left\nby the wind.\n\n\"Now look out for the ball... we\'ll throw it back.\"\n\n\"What do you want, your honor?\" asked an artilleryman, standing\nclose by, who heard him muttering.\n\n\"Nothing... only a shell...\" he answered.\n\n\"Come along, our Matvevna!\" he said to himself. \"Matvevna\"* was\nthe name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which\nwas large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their\nguns seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard\nNumber One of the second gun\'s crew was \"uncle\"; Tushin looked at\nhim more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every\nmovement. The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now\ndiminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone\'s breathing. He\nlistened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.\n\n\n*Daughter of Matthew.\n\n\n\"Ah! Breathing again, breathing!\" he muttered to himself.\n\nHe imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was\nthrowing cannon balls at the French with both hands.\n\n\"Now then, Matvevna, dear old lady, don\'t let me down!\" he was\nsaying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice\ncalled above his head: \"Captain Tushin! Captain!\"\n\nTushin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had\nturned him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping\nvoice:\n\n\"Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...\"\n\n\"Why are they down on me?\" thought Tushin, looking in alarm at his\nsuperior.\n\n\"I... don\'t...\" he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.\n\"I...\"\n\nBut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon\nball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.\nHe paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another\nball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.\n\n\"Retire! All to retire!\" he shouted from a distance.\n\nThe soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the\nsame order.\n\nIt was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the\nspace where Tushin\'s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with\na broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed\nhorses. Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the\nlimbers lay several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he\napproached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the\nmere thought of being afraid roused him again. \"I cannot be afraid,\"\nthought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the\norder and did not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns\nremoved from their positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together\nwith Tushin, stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from\nthe French, he attended to the removal of the guns.\n\n\"A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,\" said an\nartilleryman to Prince Andrew. \"Not like your honor!\"\n\nPrince Andrew said nothing to Tushin. They were both so busy as to\nseem not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two\ncannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down\nthe hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind),\nPrince Andrew rode up to Tushin.\n\n\"Well, till we meet again...\" he said, holding out his hand to\nTushin.\n\n\"Good-by, my dear fellow,\" said Tushin. \"Dear soul! Good-by, my dear\nfellow!\" and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.');

It was growing\ndark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous.\nThe cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on\nthe right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as Tushin with his guns,\ncontinually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range\nof fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the\nstaff, among them the staff officer and Zherkov, who had been twice\nsent to Tushin\'s battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one\nanother, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to\nproceed, reprimanding and reproaching him. Tushin gave no orders, and,\nsilently--fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep\nwithout knowing why--rode behind on his artillery nag. Though the\norders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves\nafter troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty\ninfantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin\'s\nwattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on \"Matvevna\'s\"\ncarriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one\nhand with the other, came up to Tushin and asked for a seat.\n\n\"Captain, for God\'s sake! I\'ve hurt my arm,\" he said timidly. \"For\nGod\'s sake... I can\'t walk. For God\'s sake!\"\n\nIt was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift\nand been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.\n\n\"Tell them to give me a seat, for God\'s sake!\"\n\n\"Give him a seat,\" said Tushin. \"Lay a cloak for him to sit on,\nlad,\" he said, addressing his favorite soldier. \"And where is the\nwounded officer?\"\n\n\"He has been set down. He died,\" replied someone.\n\n\"Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,\nAntonov.\"\n\nThe cadet was Rostov. With one hand he supported the other; he was\npale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on\n\"Matvevna,\" the gun from which they had removed the dead officer.\nThe cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his\nbreeches and arm.\n\n\"What, are you wounded, my lad?\" said Tushin, approaching the gun on\nwhich Rostov sat.\n\n\"No, it\'s a sprain.\"\n\n\"Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?\" inquired Tushin.\n\n\"It was the officer, your honor, stained it,\" answered the\nartilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if\napologizing for the state of his gun.\n\nIt was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by\nthe infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they\nhalted. It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the\nuniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly,\nnear by on the right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of\nshot gleamed in the darkness. This was the last French attack and\nwas met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses. They\nall rushed out of the village again, but Tushin\'s guns could not move,\nand the artillerymen, Tushin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances\nas they awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking\neagerly, streamed out of a side street.\n\n\"Not hurt, Petrov?\" asked one.\n\n\"We\'ve given it \'em hot, mate! They won\'t make another push now,\"\nsaid another.\n\n\"You couldn\'t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows!\nNothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn\'t there something to\ndrink?\"\n\nThe French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and\nagain in the complete darkness Tushin\'s guns moved forward, surrounded\nby the humming infantry as by a frame.\n\nIn the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was\nflowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and\nthe sound of hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and\nvoices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other\nsound in the darkness of the night. The gloom that enveloped the\narmy was filled with their groans, which seemed to melt into one\nwith the darkness of the night. After a while the moving mass became\nagitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite,\nand said something in passing: \"What did he say? Where to, now?\nHalt, is it? Did he thank us?\" came eager questions from all sides.\nThe whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report\nspread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had\nhalted. All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.\n\nFires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Tushin,\nhaving given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a\ndressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a\nbonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostov, too, dragged\nhimself to the fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering\nshook his whole body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but\nhe kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm, for which\nhe could find no satisfactory position. He kept closing his eyes and\nthen again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red,\nand at the feeble, round-shouldered figure of Tushin who was sitting\ncross-legged like a Turk beside him. Tushin\'s large, kind, intelligent\neyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostov, who saw\nthat Tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not.\n\nFrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry,\nwho were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The\nsound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses\' hoofs moving in mud,\nthe crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous\nrumble.\n\nIt was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through\nthe gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a\nstorm. Rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed\nbefore and around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on\nhis heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.\n\n\"You don\'t mind your honor?\" he asked Tushin. \"I\'ve lost my company,\nyour honor. I don\'t know where... such bad luck!\"\n\nWith the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came\nup to the bonfire, and addressing Tushin asked him to have the guns\nmoved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers\nrushed to the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately,\neach trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding\non to.\n\n\"You picked it up?... I dare say! You\'re very smart!\" one of them\nshouted hoarsely.\n\nThen a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg\nband, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.\n\n\"Must one die like a dog?\" said he.\n\nTushin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier\nran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.\n\n\"A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you,\nfellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire--we\'ll return it with\ninterest,\" said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.\n\nNext came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and\npassed by the fire. One of them stumbled.\n\n\"Who the devil has put the logs on the road?\" snarled he.\n\n\"He\'s dead--why carry him?\" said another.\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\nAnd they disappeared into the darkness with their load.\n\n\"Still aching?\" Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Your honor, you\'re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,\"\nsaid a gunner, coming up to Tushin.\n\n\"Coming, friend.\"\n\nTushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,\nwalked away from the fire.\n\nNot far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared\nfor him, Prince Bagration sat at dinner, talking with some\ncommanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old\nman with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton\nbone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years,\nflushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with\nthe signet ring, and Zherkov, uneasily glancing at them all, and\nPrince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering\neyes.\n\nIn a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French,\nand the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture,\nshaking his head in perplexity--perhaps because the banner really\ninterested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was,\nto look on at a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next\nhut there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our\ndragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look at him. Prince\nBagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into\ndetails of the action and our losses. The general whose regiment had\nbeen inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the\naction began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the men who were\nwoodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had made a\nbayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French\ntroops.\n\n\"When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was\ndisorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: \'I\'ll let them come\non and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion\'--and\nthat\'s what I did.\"\n\nThe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not\nmanaged to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened.\nPerhaps it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid\nall that confusion what did or did not happen?\n\n\"By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,\" he\ncontinued--remembering Dolokhov\'s conversation with Kutuzov and his\nlast interview with the gentleman-ranker--\"that Private Dolokhov, who\nwas reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my\npresence and particularly distinguished himself.\"\n\n\"I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,\"\nchimed in Zherkov, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the\nhussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry\nofficer. \"They broke up two squares, your excellency.\"\n\nSeveral of those present smiled at Zherkov\'s words, expecting one of\nhis usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the\nglory of our arms and of the day\'s work, they assumed a serious\nexpression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie\ndevoid of any foundation. Prince Bagration turned to the old colonel:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically:\ninfantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were\nabandoned in the center?\" he inquired, searching with his eyes for\nsomeone. (Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns on the left\nflank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the\nvery beginning of the action.) \"I think I sent you?\" he added, turning\nto the staff officer on duty.\n\n\"One was damaged,\" answered the staff officer, \"and the other I\ncan\'t understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had\nonly just left.... It is true that it was hot there,\" he added,\nmodestly.\n\nSomeone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close to the\nvillage and had already been sent for.\n\n\"Oh, but you were there?\" said Prince Bagration, addressing Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\"Of course, we only just missed one another,\" said the staff\nofficer, with a smile to Bolkonski.\n\n\"I had not the pleasure of seeing you,\" said Prince Andrew, coldly\nand abruptly.\n\nAll were silent. Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way\ntimidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past\nthe generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always\nwas by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of\nthe banner and stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.\n\n\"How was it a gun was abandoned?\" asked Bagration, frowning, not\nso much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom\nZherkov laughed loudest.\n\nOnly now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his\nguilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive\npresent themselves to Tushin in all their horror. He had been so\nexcited that he had not thought about it until that moment. The\nofficers\' laughter confused him still more. He stood before\nBagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to\nmutter: \"I don\'t know... your excellency... I had no men... your\nexcellency.\"\n\n\"You might have taken some from the covering troops.\"\n\nTushin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that\nwas perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into\ntrouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy who\nhas blundered looks at an examiner.\n\nThe silence lasted some time. Prince Bagration, apparently not\nwishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture\nto intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows\nand his fingers twitched nervously.\n\n\"Your excellency!\" Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt\nvoice,\" you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin\'s battery. I\nwent there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two\nguns smashed, and no supports at all.\"\n\nPrince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at\nBolkonski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.\n\n\"And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,\" he\ncontinued, \"we owe today\'s success chiefly to the action of that\nbattery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company,\"\nand without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.\n\nPrince Bagration looked at Tushin, evidently reluctant to show\ndistrust in Bolkonski\'s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to\ncredit it, bent his head, and told Tushin that he could go. Prince\nAndrew went out with him.\n\n\"Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!\" said Tushin.\n\nPrince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He\nfelt sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had\nhoped.\n\n\n\"Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all\nthis end?\" thought Rostov, looking at the changing shadows before him.\nThe pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible\ndrowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the\nimpression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged\nwith the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers--wounded and\nunwounded--it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting\nthe sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder.\nTo rid himself of them he closed his eyes.\n\nFor a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things\nappeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand,\nSonya\'s thin little shoulders, Natasha\'s eyes and laughter, Denisov\nwith his voice and mustache, and Telyanin and all that affair with\nTelyanin and Bogdanich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier\nwith the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that\nwere so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and\nalways dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them,\nbut they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair\'s\nbreadth. It would not ache--it would be well--if only they did not\npull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.\n\nHe opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung\nless than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling\nsnow were fluttering in that light. Tushin had not returned, the\ndoctor had not come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was\nsitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow\nbody.\n\n\"Nobody wants me!\" thought Rostov. \"There is no one to help me or\npity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.\" He\nsighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.\n\n\"Eh, is anything hurting you?\" asked the soldier, shaking his\nshirt out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt\nand added: \"What a lot of men have been crippled today--frightful!\"\n\nRostov did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes\nfluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,\nbright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his\nhealthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. \"And why\ndid I come here?\" he wondered.\n\nNext day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant\nof Bagration\'s detachment was reunited to Kutuzov\'s army.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK THREE: 1805: CHAPTER I','Prince Vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his\nplans. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own\nadvantage. He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom\ngetting on had become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he\nnever rightly accounted to himself, but which formed the whole\ninterest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves in his\nmind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met. Of these\nplans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only\nbeginning to form themselves, some approaching achievement, and some\nin course of disintegration. He did not, for instance, say to himself:\n\"This man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship\nand through him obtain a special grant.\" Nor did he say to himself:\n\"Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend\nme the forty thousand rubles I need.\" But when he came across\na man of position his instinct immediately told him that this\nman could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vasili\ntook the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become\nintimate with him, and finally make his request.\n\nHe had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an\nappointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time\nconferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the\nyoung man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house.\nWith apparent absent-mindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance\nthat he was doing the right thing, Prince Vasili did everything to get\nPierre to marry his daughter. Had he thought out his plans\nbeforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected\nfamiliarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him\nin social standing. Something always drew him toward those richer\nand more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the\nmost opportune moment for making use of people.\n\nPierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezukhov and a rich man, felt\nhimself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset\nand preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He\nhad to sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the\npurpose of which was not clear to him, to question his chief\nsteward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive many people\nwho formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would\nnow have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them.\nThese different people--businessmen, relations, and acquaintances\nalike--were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most\nfriendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly\nconvinced of Pierre\'s noble qualities. He was always hearing such\nwords as: \"With your remarkable kindness,\" or, \"With your excellent\nheart,\" \"You are yourself so honorable Count,\" or, \"Were he as\nclever as you,\" and so on, till he began sincerely to believe in his\nown exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so\nas in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he\nreally was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly\nbeen spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle\nand affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and\nhair plastered down like a doll\'s, had come into Pierre\'s room after\nthe funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him\nshe was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not\nnow feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for\npermission, after the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks\nlonger in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much.\nShe could not refrain from weeping at these words. Touched that this\nstatuesque princess could so change, Pierre took her hand and begged\nher forgiveness, without knowing what for. From that day the eldest\nprincess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped\nscarf for him.\n\n\"Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with\na great deal from the deceased,\" said Prince Vasili to him, handing\nhim a deed to sign for the princess\' benefit.\n\nPrince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to\nthrow this bone--a bill for thirty thousand rubles--to the poor\nprincess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the\naffair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after\nthat the princess grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became\naffectionate to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with\nthe mole, who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own\nconfusion when meeting him.\n\nIt seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it\nwould have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he\ncould not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides,\nhe had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or\nnot. He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and\ncheerful intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some\nimportant and general movement; that something was constantly expected\nof him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many\npeople, but if he did this and that, all would be well; and he did\nwhat was demanded of him, but still that happy result always\nremained in the future.\n\nMore than anyone else, Prince Vasili took possession of Pierre\'s\naffairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of\nCount Bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air\nof a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would\nnot, for pity\'s sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was\nthe son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth,\nto the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few\ndays he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bezukhov, he would\ncall Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be\ndone in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding\nevery time: \"You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is\npurely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also\nknow quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,\" said Prince\nVasili one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre\'s elbow,\nspeaking as if he were saying something which had long since been\nagreed upon and could not now be altered. \"We start tomorrow and I\'m\ngiving you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important\nbusiness here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago.\nHere is something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for\nyou, and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a\nGentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open\nbefore you.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words\nwere pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his\ncareer, wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasili\ninterrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the\npossibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases\nwhen special persuasion was needed.\n\n\"Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my\nconscience, and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever\ncomplained yet of being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you\ncould throw it up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself\nwhen you get to Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from\nthese terrible recollections.\" Prince Vasili sighed. \"Yes, yes, my\nboy. And my valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly\nforgetting,\" he added. \"You know, mon cher, your father and I had some\naccounts to settle, so I have received what was due from the Ryazan\nestate and will keep it; you won\'t require it. We\'ll go into the\naccounts later.\"\n\nBy \"what was due from the Ryazan estate\" Prince Vasili meant several\nthousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre\'s peasants, which the\nprince had retained for himself.\n\nIn Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of\ngentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather\nthe rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasili had procured for\nhim, and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so\nnumerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of\nbewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, always\nin front of him but never attained.\n\nOf his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in\nPetersburg. The Guards had gone to the front; Dolokhov had been\nreduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the\nprovinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity\nto spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open his\nmind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he\nrespected. His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and\nwas spent chiefly at Prince Vasili\'s house in the company of the stout\nprincess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Helene.\n\nLike the others, Anna Pavlovna Scherer showed Pierre the change of\nattitude toward him that had taken place in society.\n\nFormerly in Anna Pavlovna\'s presence, Pierre had always felt that\nwhat he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that\nremarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind\nbecame foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary\nHippolyte\'s stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now\neverything Pierre said was charmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did not say\nso, he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard\nfor his modesty.\n\nIn the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna\nPavlovna\'s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:\n\"You will find the beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful\nto see.\"\n\nWhen he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some\nlink which other people recognized had grown up between himself and\nHelene, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation\nwere being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased\nhim as an entertaining supposition.\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s \"At Home\" was like the former one, only the\nnovelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a\ndiplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the\nEmperor Alexander\'s visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august\nfriends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold\nthe cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna\nPavlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently\nrelating to the young man\'s recent loss by the death of Count Bezukhov\n(everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was\ngreatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and\nher melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the\nmention of her most august Majesty the Empress Marya Fedorovna. Pierre\nfelt flattered by this. Anna Pavlovna arranged the different groups in\nher drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which\nwere Prince Vasili and the generals, had the benefit of the\ndiplomat. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join\nthe former, but Anna Pavlovna--who was in the excited condition of a\ncommander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant\nideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action--seeing\nPierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:\n\n\"Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.\" (She\nglanced at Helene and smiled at her.) \"My dear Helene, be charitable\nto my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten\nminutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count\nwho will not refuse to accompany you.\"\n\nThe beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna detained Pierre,\nlooking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.\n\n\"Isn\'t she exquisite?\" she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately\nbeauty as she glided away. \"And how she carries herself! For so\nyoung a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It\ncomes from her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least\nworldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society.\nDon\'t you think so? I only wanted to know your opinion,\" and Anna\nPavlovna let Pierre go.\n\nPierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Helene\'s\nperfection of manner. If he ever thought of Helene, it was just of her\nbeauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in\nsociety.\n\nThe old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed\ndesirous of hiding her adoration for Helene and inclined rather to\nshow her fear of Anna Pavlovna. She looked at her niece, as if\ninquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them,\nAnna Pavlovna again touched Pierre\'s sleeve, saying: \"I hope you won\'t\nsay that it is dull in my house again,\" and she glanced at Helene.\n\nHelene smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the\npossibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt\ncoughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to\nsee Helene, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome\nand the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation,\nHelene turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she\ngave to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so\nlittle meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt\nwas just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to\nPierre\'s father, Count Bezukhov, and showed them her own box. Princess\nHelene asked to see the portrait of the aunt\'s husband on the box lid.\n\n\"That is probably the work of Vinesse,\" said Pierre, mentioning a\ncelebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the\nsnuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.\n\nHe half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the\nsnuffbox, passing it across Helene\'s back. Helene stooped forward to\nmake room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at\nevening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut\nvery low at front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like\nmarble to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could\nnot but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near\nto his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have\ntouched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of\nperfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see\nher marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the\ncharm of her body only covered by her garments. And having once seen\nthis he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an\nillusion we have once seen through.\n\n\"So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?\" Helene seemed\nto say. \"You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman\nwho may belong to anyone--to you too,\" said her glance. And at that\nmoment Pierre felt that Helene not only could, but must, be his\nwife, and that it could not be otherwise.\n\nHe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing\nat the altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know,\nhe did not even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he\nknew not why, that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would\nhappen.\n\nPierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more\nto see her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen\nher every day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could\nnot, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe\ngrass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it\nfor a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass.\nShe was terribly close to him. She already had power over him, and\nbetween them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his\nown will.\n\n\"Well, I will leave you in your little corner,\" came Anna Pavlovna\'s\nvoice, \"I see you are all right there.\"\n\nAnd Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done\nanything reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him\nthat everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.\n\nA little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna\nsaid to him: \"I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?\"\n\nThis was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and\nPierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg\nhouse done up.\n\n\"That\'s a good thing, but don\'t move from Prince Vasili\'s. It is\ngood to have a friend like the prince,\" she said, smiling at Prince\nVasili. \"I know something about that. Don\'t I? And you are still so\nyoung. You need advice. Don\'t be angry with me for exercising an old\nwoman\'s privilege.\"\n\nShe paused, as women always do, expecting something after they\nhave mentioned their age. \"If you marry it will be a different thing,\"\nshe continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at\nHelene nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He\nmuttered something and colored.\n\nWhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking\nof what had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely\nunderstood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her\nbeauty was mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: \"Yes, she\'s good\nlooking,\" he had understood that this woman might belong to him.\n\n\"But she\'s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,\" he thought.\n\"There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites\nin me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with\nher and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that\'s\nwhy he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasili is her\nfather... It\'s bad....\" he reflected, but while he was thinking this\n(the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and\nwas conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while\nthinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be\nhis wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all\nhe had thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her\nnot as the daughter of Prince Vasili, but visualized her whole body\nonly veiled by its gray dress. \"But no! Why did this thought never\noccur to me before?\" and again he told himself that it was impossible,\nthat there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him\ndishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks\nand the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He\nrecalled Anna Pavlovna\'s words and looks when she spoke to him about\nhis house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasili and\nothers, and was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way,\nbound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he\nought not to do. But at the very time he was expressing this\nconviction to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in\nall its womanly beauty.');

But before leaving home and undertaking\nthese new affairs, Prince Vasili had to settle matters with Pierre,\nwho, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in\nPrince Vasili\'s house where he was staying, and had been absurd,\nexcited, and foolish in Helene\'s presence (as a lover should be),\nbut had not yet proposed to her.\n\n\"This is all very fine, but things must be settled,\" said Prince\nVasili to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that\nPierre who was under such obligations to him (\"But never mind that\")\nwas not behaving very well in this matter. \"Youth, frivolity... well,\nGod be with him,\" thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,\n\"but it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be\nLelya\'s name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does\nnot understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair--yes, my\naffair. I am her father.\"\n\nSix weeks after Anna Pavlovna\'s \"At Home\" and after the sleepless\nnight when he had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and\nthat he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision,\nhad not left Prince Vasili\'s and felt with terror that in people\'s\neyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was\nimpossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that\nhe could not break away from her, and that though it would be a\nterrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might\nperhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vasili (who had\nrarely before given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without\nhaving an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he\nwished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone\'s\nexpectation. Prince Vasili, in the rare moments when he was at home,\nwould take Pierre\'s hand in passing and draw it downwards, or\nabsent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre\nto kiss and would say: \"Till tomorrow,\" or, \"Be in to dinner or I\nshall not see you,\" or, \"I am staying in for your sake,\" and so on.\nAnd though Prince Vasili, when he stayed in (as he said) for\nPierre\'s sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre\nfelt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to himself one and\nthe same thing: \"It is time I understood her and made up my mind\nwhat she really is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No,\nshe is not stupid, she is an excellent girl,\" he sometimes said to\nhimself \"she never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She\nsays little, but what she does say is always clear and simple, so\nshe is not stupid. She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so\nshe cannot be a bad woman!\" He had often begun to make reflections\nor think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him\neither by a brief but appropriate remark--showing that it did not\ninterest her--or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than\nanything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in\nregarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.\n\nShe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant\nfor him alone, in which there was something more significant than in\nthe general smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that\neveryone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line,\nand he knew that sooner or later he would step across it, but an\nincomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful\nstep. A thousand times during that month and a half while he felt\nhimself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to\nhimself: \"What am I doing? I need resolution. Can it be that I have\nnone?\"\n\nHe wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this\nmatter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself\nand really possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when\nthey feel themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was\noverpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at\nAnna Pavlovna\'s, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire\nparalyzed his will.\n\nOn Helene\'s name day, a small party of just their own people--as his\nwife said--met for supper at Prince Vasili\'s. All these friends and\nrelations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl\nwould be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.\nPrincess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,\nwas sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the\nmore important guests--an old general and his wife, and Anna\nPavlovna Scherer. At the other end sat the younger and less\nimportant guests, and there too sat the members of the family, and\nPierre and Helene, side by side. Prince Vasili was not having any\nsupper: he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by\none, now by another, of the guests. To each of them he made some\ncareless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Helene, whose\npresence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The\nwax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did\nthe ladies\' toilets and the gold and silver of the men\'s epaulets;\nservants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the clatter of\nplates, knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several\nconversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was\nheard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at\nwhich she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the\nmisfortunes of some Mary Viktorovna or other. At the center of the\ntable, Prince Vasili attracted everybody\'s attention. With a facetious\nsmile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday\'s\nmeeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich\nVyazmitinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had\nreceived and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander\nfrom the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said that he was\nreceiving from all sides declarations of the people\'s loyalty, that\nthe declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that\nhe was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor\nto be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: \"Sergey\nKuzmich, From all sides reports reach me,\" etc.\n\n\"Well, and so he never got farther than: \'Sergey Kuzmich\'?\" asked\none of the ladies.\n\n\"Exactly, not a hair\'s breadth farther,\" answered Prince Vasili,\nlaughing, \"\'Sergey Kuzmich... From all sides... From all sides...\nSergey Kuzmich...\' Poor Vyazmitinov could not get any farther! He\nbegan the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered \'Sergey\'\nhe sobbed, \'Kuz-mi-ch,\' tears, and \'From all sides\' was smothered in\nsobs and he could get no farther. And again his handkerchief, and\nagain: \'Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides,\'... and tears, till at last\nsomebody else was asked to read it.\"\n\n\"Kuzmich... From all sides... and then tears,\" someone repeated\nlaughing.\n\n\"Don\'t be unkind,\" cried Anna Pavlovna from her end of the table\nholding up a threatening finger. \"He is such a worthy and excellent\nman, our dear Vyazmitinov....\"\n\nEverybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where\nthe honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and\nunder the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre\nand Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the\ntable, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that\nhad nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmich--a smile of bashfulness at their\nown feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked,\nmuch as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and however\nthey avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant\nas they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances\nthey gave that the story about Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the\nfood were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company\nwas directed to--Pierre and Helene. Prince Vasili mimicked the sobbing\nof Sergey Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his\ndaughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly\nsaid: \"Yes... it\'s getting on, it will all be settled today.\" Anna\nPavlovna threatened him on behalf of \"our dear Vyazmitinov,\" and in\nher eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasili read\na congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter\'s\nhappiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to\nthe old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and\nher sigh seemed to say: \"Yes, there\'s nothing left for you and me\nbut to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these\nyoung ones to be thus boldly, provocatively happy.\" \"And what nonsense\nall this is that I am saying!\" thought a diplomatist, glancing at\nthe happy faces of the lovers. \"That\'s happiness!\"\n\nInto the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting\nthat society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a\nhealthy and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this\nhuman feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their\naffected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the\nanimation was evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the\nfootmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their\nduties as they looked at the beautiful Helene with her radiant face\nand at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It\nseemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two\nhappy faces alone.\n\nPierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased\nand embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some\noccupation. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only\nnow and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of\nreality shot unexpectedly through his mind.\n\n\"So it is all finished!\" he thought. \"And how has it all happened?\nHow quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself\nalone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They\nare all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I\ncannot, I cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not\nknow, but it will certainly happen!\" thought Pierre, glancing at those\ndazzling shoulders close to his eyes.\n\nOr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it\nawkward to attract everyone\'s attention and to be considered a lucky\nman and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris\npossessed of a Helen. \"But no doubt it always is and must be so!\" he\nconsoled himself. \"And besides, what have I done to bring it about?\nHow did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasili. Then\nthere was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I\nplayed cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with\nher. How did it begin, when did it all come about?\" And here he was\nsitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her\nnearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would\nsuddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually\nbeautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and\nflattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest,\nraise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a\nfamiliar voice repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre\nwas so absorbed that he did not understand what was said.\n\n\"I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski,\" repeated\nPrince Vasili a third time. \"How absent-minded you are, my dear\nfellow.\"\n\nPrince Vasili smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling\nat him and Helene. \"Well, what of it, if you all know it?\" thought\nPierre. \"What of it? It\'s the truth!\" and he himself smiled his gentle\nchildlike smile, and Helene smiled too.\n\n\"When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?\" repeated Prince\nVasili, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a\ndispute.\n\n\"How can one talk or think of such trifles?\" thought Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, from Olmutz,\" he answered, with a sigh.\n\nAfter supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the\ndrawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking\nleave of Helene. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an\nimportant occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go\naway, refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a\nmournful silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity\nof his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre\'s happiness. The\nold general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was.\n\"Oh, the old fool,\" he thought. \"That Princess Helene will be\nbeautiful still when she\'s fifty.\"\n\n\"I think I may congratulate you,\" whispered Anna Pavlovna to the old\nprincess, kissing her soundly. \"If I hadn\'t this headache I\'d have\nstayed longer.\"\n\nThe old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her\ndaughter\'s happiness.\n\nWhile the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a\nlong time alone with Helene in the little drawing room where they were\nsitting. He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained\nalone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt\nthat it was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take\nthe final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone\nelse\'s place here beside Helene. \"This happiness is not for you,\" some\ninner voice whispered to him. \"This happiness is for those who have\nnot in them what there is in you.\"\n\nBut, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether\nshe was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple\nmanner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest\nshe had ever had.\n\nSome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in\nthe large drawing room. Prince Vasili came up to Pierre with languid\nfootsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasili\ngave him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just\nsaid was so strange that one could not take it in. But then the\nexpression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre\'s hand downwards,\nmade him sit down, and smiled affectionately.\n\n\"Well, Lelya?\" he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and\naddressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural\nto parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which\nPrince Vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents.\n\nAnd he again turned to Pierre.\n\n\"Sergey Kuzmich--From all sides-\" he said, unbuttoning the top\nbutton of his waistcoat.\n\nPierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the\nstory about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just then,\nand Prince Vasili saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered\nsomething and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince\nwas disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the\nworld touched Pierre: he looked at Helene and she too seemed\ndisconcerted, and her look seemed to say: \"Well, it is your own\nfault.\"\n\n\"The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!\" thought Pierre, and\nhe again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergey\nKuzmich, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it\nproperly. Helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it.\n\nWhen Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the princess, his\nwife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.\n\n\"Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...\"\n\n\"Marriages are made in heaven,\" replied the elderly lady.\n\nPrince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat\ndown on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and\nseemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.\n\n\"Aline,\" he said to his wife, \"go and see what they are about.\"\n\nThe princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified\nand indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room.\nPierre and Helene still sat talking just as before.\n\n\"Still the same,\" she said to her husband.\n\nPrince Vasili frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and\nhis face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him.\nShaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps\nwent past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he\nwent joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant\nthat Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it.\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Prince Vasili. \"My wife has told me everything!\"\n(He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)--\"My\ndear boy... Lelya... I am very pleased.\" (His voice trembled.) \"I\nloved your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless\nyou!...\"\n\nHe embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with\nhis malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.\n\n\"Princess, come here!\" he shouted.\n\nThe old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using\nher handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful\nHelene\'s hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.\n\n\"All this had to be and could not be otherwise,\" thought Pierre, \"so\nit is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because\nit\'s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.\" Pierre held\nthe hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom\nas it rose and fell.\n\n\"Helene!\" he said aloud and paused.\n\n\"Something special is always said in such cases,\" he thought, but\ncould not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face.\nShe drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.\n\n\"Oh, take those off... those...\" she said, pointing to his\nspectacles.\n\nPierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes\nhave from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a\nfrightened and inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and\nkiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she\nintercepted his lips and met them with her own. Her face struck\nPierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.\n\n\"It is too late now, it\'s done; besides I love her,\" thought Pierre.\n\n\"Je vous aime!\"* he said, remembering what has to be said at such\nmoments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of\nhimself.\n\n\n*\"I love you.\"\n\n\nSix weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezukhov\'s\nlarge, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as\npeople said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions\nof money.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK THREE: 1805: CHAPTER III','Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince Vasili\nin November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying\nhim a visit. \"I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of\ncourse I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see\nyou at the same time, my honored benefactor,\" wrote Prince Vasili. \"My\nson Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you\nwill allow him personally to express the deep respect that,\nemulating his father, he feels for you.\"\n\n\"It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors\nare coming to us of their own accord,\" incautiously remarked the\nlittle princess on hearing the news.\n\nPrince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.\n\nA fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili\'s servants came one\nevening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.\n\nOld Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasili\'s\ncharacter, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and\nAlexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors. And\nnow, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little\nprincess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion\nchanged into a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever\nhe mentioned him. On the day of Prince Vasili\'s arrival, Prince\nBolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether\nhe was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was coming, or whether\nhis being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince\nVasili\'s visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon\nhad already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his\nreport.\n\n\"Do you hear how he\'s walking?\" said Tikhon, drawing the architect\'s\nattention to the sound of the prince\'s footsteps. \"Stepping flat on\nhis heels--we know what that means....\"\n\nHowever, at nine o\'clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable\ncollar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day\nbefore and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the\nhabit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still\nvisible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of\nthe soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince\nwent through the conservatories, the serfs\' quarters, and the\noutbuildings, frowning and silent.\n\n\"Can a sleigh pass?\" he asked his overseer, a venerable man,\nresembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him\nback to the house.\n\n\"The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.\"\n\nThe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. \"God be\nthanked,\" thought the overseer, \"the storm has blown over!\"\n\n\"It would have been hard to drive up, your honor,\" he added. \"I\nheard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.\"\n\nThe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,\nfrowning.\n\n\"What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?\" he said in his\nshrill, harsh voice. \"The road is not swept for the princess my\ndaughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!\"\n\n\"Your honor, I thought...\"\n\n\"You thought!\" shouted the prince, his words coming more and more\nrapidly and indistinctly. \"You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...\nI\'ll teach you to think!\" and lifting his stick he swung it and\nwould have hit Alpatych, the overseer, had not the latter\ninstinctively avoided the blow. \"Thought... Blackguards...\" shouted\nthe prince rapidly.\n\nBut although Alpatych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding\nthe stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly\nbefore him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he\ncontinued to shout: \"Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!\"\ndid not lift his stick again but hurried into the house.\n\nBefore dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew\nthat the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle\nBourienne with a radiant face that said: \"I know nothing, I am the\nsame as usual,\" and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with\ndowncast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such\noccasions she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could\nnot. She thought: \"If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not\nsympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he\nwill say (as he has done before) that I\'m in the dumps.\"\n\nThe prince looked at his daughter\'s frightened face and snorted.\n\n\"Fool... or dummy!\" he muttered.\n\n\"And the other one is not here. They\'ve been telling tales,\" he\nthought--referring to the little princess who was not in the dining\nroom.\n\n\"Where is the princess?\" he asked. \"Hiding?\"\n\n\"She is not very well,\" answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a\nbright smile, \"so she won\'t come down. It is natural in her state.\"\n\n\"Hm! Hm!\" muttered the prince, sitting down.\n\nHis plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he\nflung it away. Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little\nprincess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the\nprince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to\nappear.\n\n\"I am afraid for the baby,\" she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:\n\"Heaven knows what a fright might do.\"\n\nIn general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear,\nand with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not\nrealize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The\nprince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his\ncontempt for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to\nlife at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle\nBourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her\nroom, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized\nhim.\n\n\"So we are to have visitors, mon prince?\" remarked Mademoiselle\nBourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. \"His\nExcellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son, I understand?\" she\nsaid inquiringly.\n\n\"Hm!--his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the\nservice,\" said the prince disdainfully. \"Why his son is coming I don\'t\nunderstand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don\'t\nwant him.\" (He looked at his blushing daughter.) \"Are you unwell\ntoday? Eh? Afraid of the \'minister\' as that idiot Alpatych called\nhim this morning?\"\n\n\"No, mon pere.\"\n\nThough Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice\nof a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the\nconservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and\nafter the soup the prince became more genial.\n\nAfter dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little\nprincess was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, her\nmaid. She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law.\n\nShe was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her\ncheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.\n\n\"Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,\" she said in reply to the\nprince\'s question as to how she felt.\n\n\"Do you want anything?\"\n\n\"No, merci, mon pere.\"\n\n\"Well, all right, all right.\"\n\nHe left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood\nwith bowed head.\n\n\"Has the snow been shoveled back?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven\'s sake... It was only\nmy stupidity.\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" interrupted the prince, and laughing his\nunnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss, and\nthen proceeded to his study.\n\nPrince Vasili arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by\ncoachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to\none of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.\n\nPrince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.\n\nAnatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo\nbefore a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly\nfixed his large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a\ncontinual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to\nprovide for him. And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and\na rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought,\nturn out very well and amusingly. \"And why not marry her if she really\nhas so much money? That never does any harm,\" thought Anatole.\n\nHe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had\nbecome habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his\nfather\'s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him.\nPrince Vasili\'s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round\nwith much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter\nentered, as if to say: \"Yes, that\'s how I want you to look.\"\n\n\"I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?\" Anatole asked,\nas if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been\nmentioned during the journey.\n\n\"Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious\nwith the old prince.\"\n\n\"If he starts a row I\'ll go away,\" said Prince Anatole. \"I can\'t\nbear those old men! Eh?\"\n\n\"Remember, for you everything depends on this.\"\n\nIn the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants\' rooms\nthat the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of\nboth had been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in\nher room, vainly trying to master her agitation.\n\n\"Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never\nhappen!\" she said, looking at herself in the glass. \"How shall I enter\nthe drawing room? Even if I like him I can\'t now be myself with\nhim.\" The mere thought of her father\'s look filled her with terror.\nThe little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received\nfrom Masha, the lady\'s maid, the necessary report of how handsome\nthe minister\'s son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and\nwith what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while\nthe son had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time.\nHaving received this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle\nBourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from the\ncorridor, went into Princess Mary\'s room.\n\n\"You know they\'ve come, Marie?\" said the little princess, waddling\nin, and sinking heavily into an armchair.\n\nShe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the\nmorning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully\ndone and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its\nsunken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg\nsociety, it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become.\nSome unobtrusive touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s\ntoilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.\n\n\"What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?\" she\nbegan. \"They\'ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing\nroom and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself\nup at all!\"\n\nThe little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and\nmerrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary\nshould be dressed. Princess Mary\'s self-esteem was wounded by the fact\nthat the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both\nher companions\' not having the least conception that it could be\notherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them\nwould be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to\ndress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed,\nher beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it\ntook on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as\nshe submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these\nwomen quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so\nplain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they\nbegan dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the naive and firm\nconviction women have that dress can make a face pretty.\n\n\"No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,\" said Lise, looking\nsideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. \"You have a maroon\ndress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life\nmay be at stake. But this one is too light, it\'s not becoming!\"\n\nIt was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary\nthat was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little\nprincess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were\nplaced in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged\nlower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They\nforgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered,\nand that however they might change the setting and adornment of that\nface, it would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three\nchanges to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair\nhad been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered\nand spoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a\npale-blue scarf, the little princess walked twice round her, now\nadjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now arranging\nthe scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side\nand then on the other.\n\n\"No, it will not do,\" she said decidedly, clasping her hands. \"No,\nMary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little\ngray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,\" she said\nto the maid, \"bring the princess her gray dress, and you\'ll see,\nMademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,\" she added, smiling\nwith a foretaste of artistic pleasure.\n\nBut when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained\nsitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in\nthe mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to\nburst into sobs.\n\n\"Come, dear princess,\" said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \"just one more\nlittle effort.\"\n\nThe little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to\nPrincess Mary.\n\n\"Well, now we\'ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,\" she\nsaid.\n\nThe three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s, and Katie\'s, who\nwas laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping\nof birds.\n\n\"No, leave me alone,\" said Princess Mary.\n\nHer voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the\nbirds was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large,\nthoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and\nimploringly at them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel\nto insist.\n\n\"At least, change your coiffure,\" said the little princess.\n\"Didn\'t I tell you,\" she went on, turning reproachfully to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, \"Mary\'s is a face which such a coiffure does\nnot suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.\"\n\n\"Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same\nto me,\" answered a voice struggling with tears.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to\nthemselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse\nthan usual, but it was too late. She was looking at them with an\nexpression they both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This\nexpression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she never\ninspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her\nface, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.\n\n\"You will change it, won\'t you?\" said Lise. And as Princess Mary\ngave no answer, she left the room.\n\nPrincess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise\'s\nrequest, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look\nin her glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with\ndowncast eyes and pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and\nstrangely attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried her\ninto a totally different happy world of his own. She fancied a\nchild, her own--such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her\nnurse\'s daughter--at her own breast, the husband standing by and\ngazing tenderly at her and the child. \"But no, it is impossible, I\nam too ugly,\" she thought.\n\n\"Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,\" came the\nmaid\'s voice at the door.\n\nShe roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking,\nand before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and,\nher eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit\nby a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments.\nA painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly\nlove for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess\nMary dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most\ndeeply hidden longing was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide\nthis feeling from others and even from herself, the stronger it\ngrew. \"O God,\" she said, \"how am I to stifle in my heart these\ntemptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile\nfancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?\" And scarcely had she\nput that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart.\n\"Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or\nenvious. Man\'s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee,\nbut live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God\'s\nwill to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill\nHis will.\" With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the\nfulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed,\nand having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and\ncoiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. What\ncould all that matter in comparison with the will of God, without\nWhose care not a hair of man\'s head can fall?');

When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her\nheels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little\nprincess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: \"Voila Marie!\"\nPrincess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince\nVasili\'s face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but\nimmediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting\nthe impression \"Marie\" produced on the visitors. And she saw\nMademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her\nunusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not\nsee, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving\ntoward her as she entered the room. Prince Vasili approached first,\nand she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered\nhis question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite\nwell. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She\nonly felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her\nlips a white forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair\nsmelling of pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck by his\nbeauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his\nuniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging\none foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face\nat the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her\nat all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in\nconversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of\ncomposure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man lacking in\nself-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a\nconsciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to\nfind something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung\nhis foot, and smilingly examined the princess\' hair. It was evident\nthat he could be silent in this way for a very long time. \"If anyone\nfinds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don\'t want to,\"\nhe seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a\nmanner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even\nlove--a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as\nif he said to them: \"I know you, I know you, but why should I bother\nabout you? You\'d be only too glad, of course.\" Perhaps he did not\nreally think this when he met women--even probably he did not, for in\ngeneral he thought very little--but his looks and manner gave that\nimpression. The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that\nshe did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his\nfather. The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess\nLise\'s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth.\nShe met Prince Vasili with that playful manner often employed by\nlively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between\nthe person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private,\nlong-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such\nreminiscences really exist--just as none existed in this case. Prince\nVasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew\nAnatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of\nthings that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared\nthem and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in\nthese merry reminiscences.\n\n\"Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to\nourselves, dear prince,\" said the little princess (of course, in\nFrench) to Prince Vasili. \"It\'s not as at Annette\'s* receptions\nwhere you always ran away; you remember cette chere Annette!\"\n\n\n*Anna Pavlovna.\n\n\n\"Ah, but you won\'t talk politics to me like Annette!\"\n\n\"And our little tea table?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Why is it you were never at Annette\'s?\" the little princess asked\nAnatole. \"Ah, I know, I know,\" she said with a sly glance, \"your\nbrother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!\" and she shook her\nfinger at him, \"I have even heard of your doings in Paris!\"\n\n\"And didn\'t Hippolyte tell you?\" asked Prince Vasili, turning to his\nson and seizing the little princess\' arm as if she would have run away\nand he had just managed to catch her, \"didn\'t he tell you how he\nhimself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the\ndoor? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,\" he added, turning\nto Princess Mary.\n\nWhen Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized\nthe opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.\n\nShe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since\nAnatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole\nanswered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a\nsmile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty\nlittle Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not\nfind Bald Hills dull either. \"Not at all bad!\" he thought, examining\nher, \"not at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her\nalong with her when we\'re married, la petite est gentille.\"*\n\n\n*The little one is charming.\n\n\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and\nconsidering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed\nhim. \"What are Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince\nVasili is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine\nspecimen,\" he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the\ncoming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question\nhe always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself.\nThe question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from\nhis daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly\nasked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have\nto answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings\nbut with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary,\nlittle as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. \"And why\nshould she marry?\" he thought. \"To be unhappy for certain. There\'s\nLise, married to Andrew--a better husband one would think could hardly\nbe found nowadays--but is she contented with her lot? And who would\nmarry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They\'ll take her for her\nconnections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and\neven the happier for it?\" So thought Prince Bolkonski while\ndressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an\nimmediate answer. Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident\nintention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask\nfor an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad.\n\"Well, I\'ve nothing against it,\" the prince said to himself, \"but he\nmust be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.\"\n\n\"That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!\" he added\naloud.\n\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing\nrapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little\nprincess\' dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s ribbon, Princess Mary\'s\nunbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s and Anatole\'s smiles,\nand the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. \"Got\nherself up like a fool!\" he thought, looking irritably at her. \"She is\nshameless, and he ignores her!\"\n\nHe went straight up to Prince Vasili.\n\n\"Well! How d\'ye do? How d\'ye do? Glad to see you!\"\n\n\"Friendship laughs at distance,\" began Prince Vasili in his usual\nrapid, self-confident, familiar tone. \"Here is my second son; please\nlove and befriend him.\"\n\nPrince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole.\n\n\"Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!\" he said. \"Well, come and\nkiss me,\" and he offered his cheek.\n\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and\nperfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his\nfather had told him to expect.\n\nPrince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the\nsofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasili, pointed to it\nand began questioning him about political affairs and news. He\nseemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasili said, but kept\nglancing at Princess Mary.\n\n\"And so they are writing from Potsdam already?\" he said, repeating\nPrince Vasili\'s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his\ndaughter.\n\n\"Is it for visitors you\'ve got yourself up like that, eh?\" said\nhe. \"Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for\nthe visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you\nare never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.\"\n\n\"It was my fault, mon pere,\" interceded the little princess, with\na blush.\n\n\"You must do as you please,\" said Prince Bolkonski, bowing to his\ndaughter-in-law, \"but she need not make a fool of herself, she\'s plain\nenough as it is.\"\n\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who\nwas reduced to tears.\n\n\"On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,\"\nsaid Prince Vasili.\n\n\"Now you, young prince, what\'s your name?\" said Prince Bolkonski,\nturning to Anatole, \"come here, let us talk and get acquainted.\"\n\n\"Now the fun begins,\" thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile\nbeside the old prince.\n\n\"Well, my dear boy, I hear you\'ve been educated abroad, not taught\nto read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,\nmy dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?\" asked the old\nman, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.\n\n\"No, I have been transferred to the line,\" said Anatole, hardly able\nto restrain his laughter.\n\n\"Ah! That\'s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the\nTsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve.\nWell, are you off to the front?\"\n\n\"No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am\nattached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?\" said Anatole,\nturning to his father with a laugh.\n\n\"A splendid soldier, splendid! \'What am I attached to!\' Ha, ha, ha!\"\nlaughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly\nPrince Bolkonski frowned.\n\n\"You may go,\" he said to Anatole.\n\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladies.\n\n\"And so you\'ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vasili, haven\'t you?\"\nsaid the old prince to Prince Vasili.\n\n\"I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education\nthere is much better than ours.\"\n\n\"Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The\nlad\'s a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.\" He took\nPrince Vasili\'s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were\nalone together, Prince Vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the\nold prince.\n\n\"Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can\'t part from\nher?\" said the old prince angrily. \"What an idea! I\'m ready for it\ntomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better.\nYou know my principles--everything aboveboard? I will ask her tomorrow\nin your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can\nstay and I\'ll see.\" The old prince snorted. \"Let her marry, it\'s all\nthe same to me!\" he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting\nfrom his son.\n\n\"I will tell you frankly,\" said Prince Vasili in the tone of a\ncrafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so\nkeen-sighted companion. \"You know, you see right through people.\nAnatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an\nexcellent son or kinsman.\"\n\n\"All right, all right, we\'ll see!\"\n\nAs always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of\ntime without male society, on Anatole\'s appearance all the three women\nof Prince Bolkonski\'s household felt that their life had not been real\ntill then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing\nimmediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have\nbeen passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full\nof significance.\n\nPrincess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The\nhandsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband\nabsorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave,\ndetermined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that.\nThousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her\nimagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal them.\n\n\"But am I not too cold with him?\" thought the princess. \"I try to be\nreserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him\nalready, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine\nthat I do not like him.\"\n\nAnd Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to\nher new guest. \"Poor girl, she\'s devilish ugly!\" thought Anatole.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole\'s\narrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young\nwoman without any definite position, without relations or even a\ncountry, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince\nBolkonski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess\nMary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian\nprince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the\nplain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in\nlove with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian\nprince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but\nfinished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It\nwas the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor\nmother (sa pauvre mere) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a\nman without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to\ntears as in imagination she told this story to him, her seducer. And\nnow he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away\nand then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her. So her\nfuture shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s head at the very time\nshe was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that\nguided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should\ndo), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that\nAnatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she\nwished and tried to please him as much as possible.\n\nThe little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,\nunconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the\nfamiliar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any\nstruggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.\n\nAlthough in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man\ntired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the\nspectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was\nbeginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle\nBourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him\nwith great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless\nactions.\n\nAfter tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess\nMary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in\nhigh spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside\nMademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully\njoyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately\npoetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more\npoetic. But Anatole\'s expression, though his eyes were fixed on her,\nreferred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s\nlittle foot, which he was then touching with his own under the\nclavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess\nMary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and\nhope that was also new to the princess.\n\n\"How she loves me!\" thought Princess Mary. \"How happy I am now,\nand how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband?\nCan it be possible?\" she thought, not daring to look at his face,\nbut still feeling his eyes gazing at her.\n\nIn the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole\nkissed Princess Mary\'s hand. She did not know how she found the\ncourage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came\nnear to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up\nand kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s hand. (This was not etiquette, but\nthen he did everything so simply and with such assurance!)\nMademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened\nlook.\n\n\"What delicacy!\" thought the princess. \"Is it possible that Amelie\"\n(Mademoiselle Bourienne) \"thinks I could be jealous of her, and not\nvalue her pure affection and devotion to me?\" She went up to her and\nkissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess\' hand.\n\n\"No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are\nbehaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!\" she\nsaid. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.');

She feared to look round,\nit seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen\nin the dark corner. And this someone was he--the devil--and he was\nalso this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.\n\nShe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a\nlong time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at\nsomeone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of\nher pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall.\n\nThe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly\nmade. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every\nposition was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her\nnow more than ever because Anatole\'s presence had vividly recalled\nto her the time when she was not like that and when everything was\nlight and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and\nnightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy\nfeather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.\n\n\"I told you it was all lumps and holes!\" the little princess\nrepeated. \"I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it\'s not my\nfault!\" and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.\n\nThe old prince did not sleep either. Tikhon, half asleep, heard\nhim pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though\nhe had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more\npointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter,\nwhom he loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would\nconsider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he\nshould act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.\n\n\"The first man that turns up--she forgets her father and\neverything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her\ntail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she\nknew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And don\'t I see that that\nidiot had eyes only for Bourienne--I shall have to get rid of her.

She must be\nshown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at\nBourienne. No, she has no pride... but I\'ll let her see....\"\n\nThe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a\nmistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nPrincess Mary\'s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to\nbe parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this\nthought, he called Tikhon and began to undress.\n\n\"What devil brought them here?\" thought he, while Tikhon was putting\nthe nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. \"I\nnever invited them. They came to disturb my life--and there is not\nmuch of it left.\"\n\n\"Devil take \'em!\" he muttered, while his head was still covered by\nthe shirt.\n\nTikhon knew his master\'s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and\ntherefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive\nexpression of the face that emerged from the shirt.\n\n\"Gone to bed?\" asked the prince.\n\nTikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of\nhis master\'s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince\nVasili and his son.\n\n\"They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.\"\n\n\"No good... no good...\" said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his\nfeet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing\ngown, he went to the couch on which he slept.\n\nThough no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle\nBourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of\ntheir romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre mere; they\nunderstood that they had much to say to one another in private and\nso they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one\nanother alone. When Princess Mary went to her father\'s room at the\nusual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the\nconservatory.\n\nPrincess Mary went to the door of the study with special\ntrepidation. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that\nher fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she\nthought about it. She read this in Tikhon\'s face and in that of Prince\nVasili\'s valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the\ncorridor carrying hot water.\n\nThe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of\nhis daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking\nexpression of her father\'s. His face wore that expression when his dry\nhands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in\narithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,\nrepeating in a low voice the same words several times over.\n\nHe came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.\n\n\"I have had a proposition made me concerning you,\" he said with an\nunnatural smile. \"I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not\ncome and brought his pupil with him\" (for some reason Prince Bolkonski\nreferred to Anatole as a \"pupil\") \"for the sake of my beautiful\neyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you\nknow my principles, I refer it to you.\"\n\n\"How am I to understand you, mon pere?\" said the princess, growing\npale and then blushing.\n\n\"How understand me!\" cried her father angrily. \"Prince Vasili\nfinds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to\nyou on his pupil\'s behalf. That\'s how it\'s to be understood! \'How\nunderstand it\'!... And I ask you!\"\n\n\"I do not know what you think, Father,\" whispered the princess.\n\n\"I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I\'m not going to\nget married. What about you? That\'s what I want to know.\"\n\nThe princess saw that her father regarded the matter with\ndisapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her\nfate would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not\nto see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but\nwould only be able to submit from habit, and she said: \"I wish only to\ndo your will, but if I had to express my own desire...\" She had no\ntime to finish. The old prince interrupted her.\n\n\"That\'s admirable!\" he shouted. \"He will take you with your dowry\nand take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She\'ll be the\nwife, while you...\"\n\nThe prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on\nhis daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.\n\n\"Now then, now then, I\'m only joking!\" he said. \"Remember this,\nPrincess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to\nchoose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life\'s happiness\ndepends on your decision. Never mind me!\"\n\n\"But I do not know, Father!\"\n\n\"There\'s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry\nyou or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room,\nthink it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence:\nyes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but\nyou had better think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!\" he\nstill shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already\nstaggered out of the study.\n\nHer fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had\nsaid about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be\nsure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of\nit. She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing\nnor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of\nMademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps\naway saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to\nher. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole\nlooked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the\nwaist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.\n\n\"Who\'s that? Why? Wait a moment!\" Anatole\'s face seemed to say.\nPrincess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand\nit. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole\nbowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in\na laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders\nwent to the door that led to his own apartments.\n\nAn hour later, Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old\nprince; he added that Prince Vasili was also there. When Tikhon came\nto her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding\nthe weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her\nhair. The princess\' beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance\nwere looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle\nBourienne\'s pretty face.\n\n\"No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!\" said\nMademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\"Why? I love you more than ever,\" said Princess Mary, \"and I will\ntry to do all I can for your happiness.\"\n\n\"But you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand\nbeing so carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...\"\n\n\"I quite understand,\" answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.\n\"Calm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,\" she said, and went\nout.\n\nPrince Vasili, with one leg thrown high over the other and a\nsnuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion\non his face, as if stirred to his heart\'s core and himself\nregretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary\nentered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, my dear!\" he began, rising and taking her by both\nhands. Then, sighing, he added: \"My son\'s fate is in your hands.\nDecide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a\ndaughter!\"\n\nHe drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.\n\n\"Fr... fr...\" snorted Prince Bolkonski. \"The prince is making a\nproposition to you in his pupil\'s--I mean, his son\'s--name. Do you\nwish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin\'s wife? Reply: yes or no,\" he\nshouted, \"and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also.\nYes, my opinion, and only my opinion,\" added Prince Bolkonski, turning\nto Prince Vasili and answering his imploring look. \"Yes, or no?\"\n\n\"My desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my\nlife from yours. I don\'t wish to marry,\" she answered positively,\nglancing at Prince Vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes.\n\n\"Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!\" cried Prince\nBolkonski, frowning and taking his daughter\'s hand; he did not kiss\nher, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and\npressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.\n\nPrince Vasili rose.\n\n\"My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never\nforget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching\nthis heart, so kind and generous? Say \'perhaps\'... The future is so\nlong. Say \'perhaps.\'\"\n\n\"Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you\nfor the honor, but I shall never be your son\'s wife.\"\n\n\"Well, so that\'s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have\nseen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!\" said the\nold prince. \"Very, very glad to have seen you,\" repeated he,\nembracing Prince Vasili.\n\n\"My vocation is a different one,\" thought Princess Mary. \"My\nvocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the\nhappiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will\narrange poor Amelie\'s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so\npassionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between\nthem. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my\nfather and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so\nunfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how\npassionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself!\nPerhaps I might have done the same!...\" thought Princess Mary.');

Not till\nmidwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son\'s\nhandwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm\nand haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read\nthe letter.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the\nhouse, on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the\nroom and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing\nat the same time.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still\nliving with the Rostovs.\n\n\"My dear friend?\" said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry,\nprepared to sympathize in any way.\n\nThe count sobbed yet more.\n\n\"Nikolenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling\nboy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How\ntell the little countess!\"\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief\nwiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried\nher own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and\ntill teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God\'s\nhelp, would inform her.\n\nAt dinner Anna Mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war\nnews and about Nikolenka, twice asked when the last letter had been\nreceived from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that\nthey might very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each\ntime that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she\nglanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikhaylovna, the latter very\nadroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters. Natasha,\nwho, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to\nfeel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her\nears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was\nsome secret between her father and Anna Mikhaylovna, that it had\nsomething to do with her brother, and that Anna Mikhaylovna was\npreparing them for it. Bold as she was, Natasha, who knew how\nsensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka, did not\nventure to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat\nanything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her\ngoverness\' remarks. After dinner, she rushed head long after Anna\nMikhaylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon\nas she overtook her in the sitting room.\n\n\"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!\"\n\n\"Nothing, my dear.\"\n\n\"No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won\'t give up--I know you know\nsomething.\"\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna shook her head.\n\n\"You are a little slyboots,\" she said.\n\n\"A letter from Nikolenka! I\'m sure of it!\" exclaimed Natasha,\nreading confirmation in Anna Mikhaylovna\'s face.\n\n\"But for God\'s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your\nmamma.\"\n\n\"I will, I will, only tell me! You won\'t? Then I will go and tell at\nonce.\"\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the\nletter, on condition that she should tell no one.\n\n\"No, on my true word of honor,\" said Natasha, crossing herself,\n\"I won\'t tell anyone!\" and she ran off at once to Sonya.\n\n\"Nikolenka... wounded... a letter,\" she announced in gleeful\ntriumph.\n\n\"Nicholas!\" was all Sonya said, instantly turning white.\n\nNatasha, seeing the impression the news of her brother\'s wound\nproduced on Sonya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the\nnews.\n\nShe rushed to Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry.\n\n\"A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he\nwrote himself,\" said she through her tears.\n\n\"There now! It\'s true that all you women are crybabies,\" remarked\nPetya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. \"Now I\'m very\nglad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself\nso. You are all blubberers and understand nothing.\"\n\nNatasha smiled through her tears.\n\n\"You haven\'t read the letter?\" asked Sonya.\n\n\"No, but she said that it was all over and that he\'s now an\nofficer.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Sonya, crossing herself. \"But perhaps she deceived\nyou. Let us go to Mamma.\"\n\nPetya paced the room in silence for a time.\n\n\"If I\'d been in Nikolenka\'s place I would have killed even more of\nthose Frenchmen,\" he said. \"What nasty brutes they are! I\'d have\nkilled so many that there\'d have been a heap of them.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!\"\n\n\"I\'m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,\" said Petya.\n\n\"Do you remember him?\" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment\'s\nsilence.\n\nSonya smiled.\n\n\"Do I remember Nicholas?\"\n\n\"No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him\nperfectly, remember everything?\" said Natasha, with an expressive\ngesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very definite\nmeaning. \"I remember Nikolenka too, I remember him well,\" she said.\n\"But I don\'t remember Boris. I don\'t remember him a bit.\"\n\n\"What! You don\'t remember Boris?\" asked Sonya in surprise.\n\n\"It\'s not that I don\'t remember--I know what he is like, but not\nas I remember Nikolenka. Him--I just shut my eyes and remember, but\nBoris... No!\" (She shut her eyes.)\"No! there\'s nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, Natasha!\" said Sonya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her\nfriend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to\nsay and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was\nout of the question, \"I am in love with your brother once for all and,\nwhatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him\nas long as I live.\"\n\nNatasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and\nsaid nothing. She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there\nwas such love as Sonya was speaking of. But Natasha had not yet felt\nanything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.\n\n\"Shall you write to him?\" she asked.\n\nSonya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas,\nand whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already\nan officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of\nherself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had\ntaken on himself?\n\n\"I don\'t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,\" she said,\nblushing.\n\n\"And you won\'t feel ashamed to write to him?\"\n\nSonya smiled.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris. I\'m not going to.\"\n\n\"Why should you be ashamed?\"\n\n\"Well, I don\'t know. It\'s awkward and would make me ashamed.\"\n\n\"And I know why she\'d be ashamed,\" said Petya, offended by Natasha\'s\nprevious remark. \"It\'s because she was in love with that fat one in\nspectacles\" (that was how Petya described his namesake, the new\nCount Bezukhov) \"and now she\'s in love with that singer\" (he meant\nNatasha\'s Italian singing master), \"that\'s why she\'s ashamed!\"\n\n\"Petya, you\'re a stupid!\" said Natasha.\n\n\"Not more stupid than you, madam,\" said the nine-year-old Petya,\nwith the air of an old brigadier.\n\nThe countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylovna\'s hints at\ndinner. On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her\neyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a\nsnuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikhaylovna,\nwith the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess\' door and paused.\n\n\"Don\'t come in,\" she said to the old count who was following her.\n\"Come later.\" And she went in, closing the door behind her.\n\nThe count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.\n\nAt first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna\nMikhaylovna\'s voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then\nsilence, then both voices together with glad intonations, and then\nfootsteps. Anna Mikhaylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud\nexpression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation\nand admits the public to appreciate his skill.\n\n\"It is done!\" she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the\ncountess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait\nand in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her\nlips.\n\nWhen she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him,\nembraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter\nand the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she\nslightly pushed away the bald head. Vera, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya\nnow entered the room, and the reading of the letter began. After a\nbrief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he\nhad taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his\nfather\'s and mother\'s hands asking for their blessing, and that he\nkissed Vera, Natasha, and Petya. Besides that, he sent greetings to\nMonsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them\nto kiss for him \"dear Sonya, whom he loved and thought of just the\nsame as ever.\" When she heard this Sonya blushed so that tears came\ninto her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran\naway into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her\ndress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped\ndown on the floor. The countess was crying.\n\n\"Why are you crying, Mamma?\" asked Vera. \"From all he says one\nshould be glad and not cry.\"\n\nThis was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natasha looked\nat her reproachfully. \"And who is it she takes after?\" thought the\ncountess.\n\nNicholas\' letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were\nconsidered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she\ndid not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses,\nand Dmitri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the\nletter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it\nfresh proofs of Nikolenka\'s virtues. How strange, how extraordinary,\nhow joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of\nwhose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son\nabout whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count,\nthat son who had first learned to say \"pear\" and then \"granny,\" that\nthis son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange\nsurroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man\'s work of his\nown, without help or guidance. The universal experience of ages,\nshowing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to\nmanhood, did not exist for the countess. Her son\'s growth toward\nmanhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her\nas if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up\nin the same way. As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the\nlittle creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry,\nsuck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not believe that\nthat little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model son\nand officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.\n\n\"What a style! How charmingly he describes!\" said she, reading the\ndescriptive part of the letter. \"And what a soul! Not a word about\nhimself.... Not a word! About some Denisov or other, though he\nhimself, I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about\nhis sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has\nremembered everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was\nonly so high--I always said....\"\n\nFor more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of\nletters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied\nout, while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of\nthe count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and\nequipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna\nMikhaylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor\nwith army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication\nfor herself and her son. She had opportunities of sending her\nletters to the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who commanded the\nGuards. The Rostovs supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was\nquite a definite address, and that if a letter reached the Grand\nDuke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not\nreach the Pavlograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the\nsame neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the letters and money\nby the Grand Duke\'s courier to Boris and Boris was to forward them\nto Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess, Petya,\nVera, Natasha, and Sonya, and finally there were six thousand rubles\nfor his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son.');

The Guards, just arrived from Russia,\nspent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come\nstraight to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o\'clock.\n\nThat day Nicholas Rostov received a letter from Boris, telling him\nthat the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles\nfrom Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money\nfor him. Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops,\nafter their active service, were stationed near Olmutz and the camp\nswarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all\nsorts of tempting wares. The Pavlograds held feast after feast,\ncelebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made\nexpeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who\nhad recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.\nRostov, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought\nDenisov\'s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and\nthe sutlers. On receiving Boris\' letter he rode with a fellow\nofficer to Olmutz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set\noff alone to the Guards\' camp to find his old playmate. Rostov had not\nyet had time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket,\ndecorated with a soldier\'s cross, equally shabby cadet\'s riding\nbreeches lined with worn leather, and an officer\'s saber with a\nsword knot. The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a\nCossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck\njauntily back on one side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he\nthought how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the\nGuards by his appearance--that of a fighting hussar who had been under\nfire.\n\nThe Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip,\nparading their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy\nstages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian\nauthorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every\nhalting place. The regiments had entered and left the town with\ntheir bands playing, and by the Grand Duke\'s orders the men had\nmarched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards prided\nthemselves), the officers on foot and at their proper posts. Boris had\nbeen quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already\nin command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during\nthe campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his\npromptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very\nsatisfactorily. Boris, during the campaign, had made the\nacquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a\nletter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become\nacquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkonski, through whom he hoped to\nobtain a post on the commander in chief\'s staff. Berg and Boris,\nhaving rested after yesterday\'s march, were sitting, clean and\nneatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to\nthem, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.\nBoris, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a\nlittle pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while\nawaiting Berg\'s move, and watched his opponent\'s face, evidently\nthinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was\nengaged on.\n\n\"Well, how are you going to get out of that?\" he remarked.\n\n\"We\'ll try to,\" replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing\nhis hand.\n\nAt that moment the door opened.\n\n\"Here he is at last!\" shouted Rostov. \"And Berg too! Oh, you\npetisenfans, allay cushay dormir!\" he exclaimed, imitating his Russian\nnurse\'s French, at which he and Boris used to laugh long ago.\n\n\"Dear me, how you have changed!\"\n\nBoris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to steady\nand replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace\nhis friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of\nyouth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a\nmanner different from that of its elders which is often insincere,\nNicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He\nwanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him--a thing\neverybody did. But notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a\nquiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.\n\nThey had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when\nyoung men take their first steps on life\'s road, each saw immense\nchanges in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which\nthey had taken those first steps. Both had changed greatly since\nthey last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had\ntaken place in them.\n\n\"Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you\'d been to a fete,\nnot like us sinners of the line,\" cried Rostov, with martial swagger\nand with baritone notes in his voice, new to Boris, pointing to his\nown mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostov\'s\nloud voice, popped her head in at the door.\n\n\"Eh, is she pretty?\" he asked with a wink.\n\n\"Why do you shout so? You\'ll frighten them!\" said Boris. \"I did\nnot expect you today,\" he added. \"I only sent you the note yesterday\nby Bolkonski--an adjutant of Kutuzov\'s, who\'s a friend of mine. I\ndid not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?\nBeen under fire already?\" asked Boris.\n\nWithout answering, Rostov shook the soldier\'s Cross of St. George\nfastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,\nglanced at Berg with a smile.\n\n\"As you see,\" he said.\n\n\"Indeed? Yes, yes!\" said Boris, with a smile. \"And we too have had a\nsplendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode\nwith our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every\nadvantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I\ncan\'t tell you. And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our\nofficers.\"\n\nAnd the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of\nhis hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the\npleasures and advantages of service under members of the Imperial\nfamily.\n\n\"Oh, you Guards!\" said Rostov. \"I say, send for some wine.\"\n\nBoris made a grimace.\n\n\"If you really want it,\" said he.\n\nHe went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and\nsent for wine.\n\n\"Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,\" he added.\n\nRostov took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both\narms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he\nglanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind\nthe letter.\n\n\"Well, they\'ve sent you a tidy sum,\" said Berg, eying the heavy\npurse that sank into the sofa. \"As for us, Count, we get along on\nour pay. I can tell you for myself...\"\n\n\"I say, Berg, my dear fellow,\" said Rostov, \"when you get a letter\nfrom home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk\neverything over with, and I happen to be there, I\'ll go at once, to be\nout of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!\" he\nexclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking\namiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his\nwords, he added, \"Don\'t be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from\nmy heart as to an old acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Oh, don\'t mention it, Count! I quite understand,\" said Berg,\ngetting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.\n\n\"Go across to our hosts: they invited you,\" added Boris.\n\nBerg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of\ndust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples\nupwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having\nassured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that his coat had\nbeen noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.\n\n\"Oh dear, what a beast I am!\" muttered Rostov, as he read the\nletter.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them\nsuch a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!\" he repeated, flushing suddenly.\n\"Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let\'s have\nsome!\"\n\nIn the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of\nrecommendation to Bagration which the old countess at Anna\nMikhaylovna\'s advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent\nto her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of\nit.\n\n\"What nonsense! Much I need it!\" said Rostov, throwing the letter\nunder the table.\n\n\"Why have you thrown that away?\" asked Boris.\n\n\"It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want\nit for!\"\n\n\"Why \'What the devil\'?\" said Boris, picking it up and reading the\naddress. \"This letter would be of great use to you.\"\n\n\"I want nothing, and I won\'t be anyone\'s adjutant.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" inquired Boris.\n\n\"It\'s a lackey\'s job!\"\n\n\"You are still the same dreamer, I see,\" remarked Boris, shaking his\nhead.\n\n\"And you\'re still the same diplomatist! But that\'s not the\npoint... Come, how are you?\" asked Rostov.\n\n\"Well, as you see. So far everything\'s all right, but I confess I\nshould much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try\nto make as successful a career of it as possible.\"\n\n\"Oh, that\'s it!\" said Rostov, evidently thinking of something else.\n\nHe looked intently and inquiringly into his friend\'s eyes, evidently\ntrying in vain to find the answer to some question.\n\nOld Gabriel brought in the wine.\n\n\"Shouldn\'t we now send for Berg?\" asked Boris. \"He would drink\nwith you. I can\'t.\"\n\n\"Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?\"\nasked Rostov, with a contemptuous smile.\n\n\"He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,\" answered\nBoris.\n\nAgain Rostov looked intently into Boris\' eyes and sighed. Berg\nreturned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three\nofficers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostov of their march and\nhow they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They\nspoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke,\nand told stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual,\nkept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in\nconnection with the stories of the Grand Duke\'s quick temper he\nrelated with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the\nGrand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was\nannoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With a pleasant smile\nBerg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent\npassion, shouting: \"Arnauts!\" (\"Arnauts\" was the Tsarevich\'s\nfavorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the\ncompany commander.\n\n\"Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I\nknew I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know\nthe Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do\nthe Lord\'s Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my\ncompany, and so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....\" (Berg\nstood up and showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his\ncap, and really it would have been difficult for a face to express\ngreater respect and self-complacency than his did.) \"Well, he\nstormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It\nwas not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is.\n\'Albanians!\' and \'devils!\' and \'To Siberia!\'\" said Berg with a\nsagacious smile. \"I knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was\nnot that best, Count?... \'Hey, are you dumb?\' he shouted. Still I\nremained silent. And what do you think, Count? The next day it was not\neven mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That\'s what keeping one\'s\nhead means. That\'s the way, Count,\" said Berg, lighting his pipe and\nemitting rings of smoke.\n\n\"Yes, that was fine,\" said Rostov, smiling.\n\nBut Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and\nskillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and\nwhere he got his wound. This pleased Rostov and he began talking about\nit, and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of\nhis Schon Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a\nbattle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to\nhave been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds\nwell, but not at all as it really was. Rostov was a truthful young man\nand would on no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story\nmeaning to tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly,\ninvoluntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told\nthe truth to his hearers--who like himself had often heard stories\nof attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and\nwere expecting to hear just such a story--they would either not have\nbelieved him or, still worse, would have thought that Rostov was\nhimself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of\ncavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply\nthat everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and\nsprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman\ninto the wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it\nwould have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only\nwhat happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young\npeople are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how\nbeside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a\nstorm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his\nsaber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And\nso he told them all that.\n\nIn the middle of his story, just as he was saying: \"You cannot\nimagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,\"\nPrince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered the room. Prince\nAndrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked\nfor his assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had\nmanaged to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young\nman wanted. Having been sent with papers from Kutuzov to the\nTsarevich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to find him alone. When he\ncame in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits\n(Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he gave Boris a\npleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at\nRostov, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the\nsofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company.\nRostov flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was a\nmere stranger. Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too\nseemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.\n\nIn spite of Prince Andrew\'s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of\nthe contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army point of\nview, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the\nnewcomer was evidently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and\nbecame silent. Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff,\nand what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.\n\n\"We shall probably advance,\" replied Bolkonski, evidently\nreluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.\n\nBerg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as\nwas rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies\nwould be doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that\nhe could give no opinion on such an important government order, and\nBerg laughed gaily.\n\n\"As to your business,\" Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris,\n\"we will talk of it later\" (and he looked round at Rostov). \"Come to\nme after the review and we will do what is possible.\"\n\nAnd, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to\nRostov, whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now\nchanging to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: \"I\nthink you were talking of the Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?\"\n\n\"I was there,\" said Rostov angrily, as if intending to insult the\naide-de-camp.\n\nBolkonski noticed the hussar\'s state of mind, and it amused him.\nWith a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: \"Yes, there are many\nstories now told about that affair!\"\n\n\"Yes, stories!\" repeated Rostov loudly, looking with eyes suddenly\ngrown furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski. \"Yes, many stories! But\nour stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy\'s\nfire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those\nfellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!\"\n\n\"Of whom you imagine me to be one?\" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet\nand particularly amiable smile.\n\nA strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this\nman\'s self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostov\'s soul.\n\n\"I am not talking about you,\" he said, \"I don\'t know you and,\nfrankly, I don\'t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.\"\n\n\"And I will tell you this,\" Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of\nquiet authority, \"you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree\nwith you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven\'t sufficient\nself-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen.\nIn a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more\nserious duel, and besides, Drubetskoy, who says he is an old friend of\nyours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to\ndisplease you. However,\" he added rising, \"you know my name and\nwhere to find me, but don\'t forget that I do not regard either\nmyself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older\nthan you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday\nafter the review I shall expect you, Drubetskoy. Au revoir!\" exclaimed\nPrince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.\n\nOnly when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostov think of what he ought\nto have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it.\nHe ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode\nhome. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that\naffected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question\nthat worried him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he\nwould have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud\nman when covered by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of\nall the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a\nfriend as that very adjutant whom he so hated.');

The two Emperors,\nthe Russian with his heir the Tsarevich, and the Austrian with the\nArchduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.\n\nFrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up\non the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets\nmoved and halted at the officers\' command, turned with banners flying,\nformed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of\ninfantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of\nhoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green\nbraided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on\nblack, roan, or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen\nclatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun\ncarriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which\ncrawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed\nposition. Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their\nthin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed\ninto their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their\ndecorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier\nwith his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and\npolished to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone\nlike satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth--felt that no\nsmall matter was happening, but an important and solemn affair. Every\ngeneral and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance,\naware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same\ntime was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole.\n\nFrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by\nten o\'clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were\ndrawn up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three\nlines: the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind\nthat again the infantry.\n\nA space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The\nthree parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutuzov\'s\nfighting army (with the Pavlograds on the right flank of the front);\nthose recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the\nline; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines,\nunder one command, and in a like order.\n\nLike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: \"They\'re coming!\nThey\'re coming!\" Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final\npreparation swept over all the troops.\n\nFrom the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was seen\napproaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light\ngust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on\nthe lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their\nstaffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was\nexpressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was\nheard shouting: \"Eyes front!\" Then, like the crowing of cocks at\nsunrise, this was repeated by others from various sides and all became\nsilent.\n\nIn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard.\nThis was the Emperors\' suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank,\nand the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general\nmarch. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as\nif the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors\' approach, had naturally\nburst into music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of\nthe Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of\ngreeting, and the first regiment roared \"Hurrah!\" so deafeningly,\ncontinuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by\ntheir multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.\n\nRostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov\'s army which the Tsar\napproached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in\nthat army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of\nmight, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this\ntriumph.\n\nHe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass\n(and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and\nwater, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and\nso he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence\nof that word.\n\n\"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\" thundered from all sides, one regiment\nafter another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and\nthen \"Hurrah!\"... Then the general march, and again \"Hurrah!\nHurrah!\" growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening\nroar.\n\nTill the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and\nimmobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it\nbecame alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along\nwhich he had already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar\nof those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing\nmotionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the\nsuites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in\nfront of them two men--the Emperors. Upon them the undivided,\ntensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was\nconcentrated.\n\nThe handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse\nGuards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his\npleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone\'s\nattention.\n\nRostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight\nhad recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within\ntwenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of\nhis handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling tenderness\nand ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every\nmovement of the Tsar\'s seemed to him enchanting.\n\nStopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said something in\nFrench to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.\n\nSeeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a\nstill stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show\nthat love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready\nto cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few\nwords to him.\n\n\"Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\"\nthought Rostov. \"I should die of happiness!\"\n\nThe Tsar addressed the officers also: \"I thank you all, gentlemen, I\nthank you with my whole heart.\" To Rostov every word sounded like a\nvoice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!\n\n\"You have earned the St. George\'s standards and will be worthy of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Oh, to die, to die for him,\" thought Rostov.\n\nThe Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hear, and the\nsoldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \"Hurrah!\"\n\nRostov too, bending over his saddle, shouted \"Hurrah!\" with all\nhis might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout,\nif only to express his rapture fully.\n\nThe Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if\nundecided.\n\n\"How can the Emperor be undecided?\" thought Rostov, but then even\nthis indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like\neverything else the Tsar did.\n\nThat hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar\'s foot, in the\nnarrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the\nbobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up\nthe reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying\nsea of aides-de-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at\nother regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to\nRostov from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.\n\nAmong the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonski,\nsitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostov recalled their\nquarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he\nought or ought not to challenge Bolkonski. \"Of course not!\" he now\nthought. \"Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment?\nAt a time of such love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do\nany of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love and forgive\neverybody now.\"\n\nWhen the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began\na ceremonial march past him, and Rostov on Bedouin, recently purchased\nfrom Denisov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron--that is,\nalone and in full view of the Emperor.\n\nBefore he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman,\nspurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in\nwhich the animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to\nhis chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the\nEmperor\'s eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a\nhigh and graceful action, as if flying through the air without\ntouching the ground.\n\nRostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and\nfeeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a\nfrowning but blissful face \"like a vewy devil,\" as Denisov expressed\nit.\n\n\"Fine fellows, the Pavlograds!\" remarked the Emperor.\n\n\"My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the\nfire this instant!\" thought Rostov.\n\nWhen the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also\nKutuzov\'s, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards,\nabout the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about\nBonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if\nthe Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.\n\nBut the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander.\nHis every word and movement was described with ecstasy.\n\nThey all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against\nthe enemy under the Emperor\'s command. Commanded by the Emperor\nhimself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might:\nso thought Rostov and most of the officers after the review.\n\nAll were then more confident of victory than the winning of two\nbattles would have made them.');

At the quarters of the commander in chief,\nKutuzov, where he inquired for Bolkonski, all the adjutants and even\nthe orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a\ngreat many officers like him were always coming there and that\neverybody was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather\nbecause of it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to\nOlmutz and, entering the house occupied by Kutuzov, asked for\nBolkonski. Prince Andrew was in and Boris was shown into a large\nhall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now\nstood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, and a\nclavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table\nin a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, stout\nNesvitski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an\nofficer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese\nwaltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang\nthe tune. Bolkonski was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his\nposition on seeing Boris. The one who was writing and whom Boris\naddressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkonski was on duty\nand that he should go through the door on the left into the\nreception room if he wished to see him. Boris thanked him and went\nto the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.\n\nWhen he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously\n(with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says,\n\"If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment\"), was\nlistening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very\nerect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier\'s obsequious expression on his\npurple face, reporting something.\n\n\"Very well, then, be so good as to wait,\" said Prince Andrew to\nthe general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he\naffected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Boris,\nPrince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him\nimploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with\na cheerful smile.\n\nAt that moment Boris clearly realized what he had before surmised,\nthat in the army, besides the subordination and discipline\nprescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the\nregiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made\nthis tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain\nPrince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant\nDrubetskoy. More than ever was Boris resolved to serve in future not\naccording to the written code, but under this unwritten law. He felt\nnow that merely by having been recommended to Prince Andrew he had\nalready risen above the general who at the front had the power to\nannihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards. Prince Andrew came up to\nhim and took his hand.\n\n\"I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing\nabout with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the\ndispositions. When Germans start being accurate, there\'s no end to\nit!\"\n\nBoris smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to\nas something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard\nWeyrother\'s name, or even the term \"dispositions.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have\nbeen thinking about you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was thinking\"--for some reason Boris could not help\nblushing--\"of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter\nfrom Prince Kuragin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear\nthe Guards won\'t be in action,\" he added as if in apology.\n\n\"All right, all right. We\'ll talk it over,\" replied Prince Andrew.\n\"Only let me report this gentleman\'s business, and I shall be at\nyour disposal.\"\n\nWhile Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general,\nthat gentleman--evidently not sharing Boris\' conception of the\nadvantages of the unwritten code of subordination--looked so fixedly\nat the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he\nhad to say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfortable. He turned\naway and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew\'s return from the\ncommander in chief\'s room.\n\n\"You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,\" said\nPrince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the\nclavichord was. \"It\'s no use your going to the commander in chief.\nHe would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner\" (\"That would\nnot be bad as regards the unwritten code,\" thought Boris), \"but\nnothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us\naides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we\'ll do: I have a\ngood friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince\nDolgorukov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now\nKutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything\nis now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorukov; I have\nto go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We\nshall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place\nfor you somewhere nearer the sun.\"\n\nPrince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a\nyoung man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining\nhelp of this kind for another, which from pride he would never\naccept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers\nsuccess and which attracted him. He very readily took up Boris\'\ncause and went with him to Dolgorukov.\n\nIt was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz\noccupied by the Emperors and their retinues.\n\nThat same day a council of war had been held in which all the\nmembers of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that\ncouncil, contrary to the views of the old generals Kutuzov and\nPrince Schwartzenberg, it had been decided to advance immediately\nand give battle to Bonaparte. The council of war was just over when\nPrince Andrew accompanied by Boris arrived at the palace to find\nDolgorukov. Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of\nthe day\'s council, at which the party of the young had triumphed.\nThe voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for\nsomething else before advancing had been so completely silenced and\ntheir arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages\nof attacking that what had been discussed at the council--the coming\nbattle and the victory that would certainly result from it--no\nlonger seemed to be in the future but in the past. All the\nadvantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior\nto Napoleon\'s, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired\nby the Emperors\' presence were eager for action. The strategic\nposition where the operations would take place was familiar in all its\ndetails to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had\nordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on\nthe very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent\nlocality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and\nBonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.\n\nDolgorukov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just\nreturned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud\nof the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his\nprotege, but Prince Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand\nsaid nothing to Boris and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts\nwhich were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince\nAndrew in French.\n\n\"Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that\nthe one that will result from it will be as victorious! However,\ndear fellow,\" he said abruptly and eagerly, \"I must confess to\nhaving been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother.\nWhat exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what\nforesight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the\nsmallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our\npresent ones could have been devised. This combination of Austrian\nprecision with Russian valor--what more could be wished for?\"\n\n\"So the attack is definitely resolved on?\" asked Bolkonski.\n\n\"And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte\nhas decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received\nfrom him today for the Emperor.\" Dolgorukov smiled significantly.\n\n\"Is that so? And what did he say?\" inquired Bolkonski.\n\n\"What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain\ntime. I tell you he is in our hands, that\'s certain! But what was most\namusing,\" he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, \"was that\nwe could not think how to address the reply! If not as \'Consul\' and of\ncourse not as \'Emperor,\' it seemed to me it should be to \'General\nBonaparte.\'\"\n\n\"But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him\nGeneral Bonaparte, there is a difference,\" remarked Bolkonski.\n\n\"That\'s just it,\" interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, laughing. \"You\nknow Bilibin--he\'s a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him\nas \'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.\'\"\n\nDolgorukov laughed merrily.\n\n\"Only that?\" said Bolkonski.\n\n\"All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the\naddress. He is a wise and clever fellow.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement\nfrancais,\" said Dolgorukov, with grave satisfaction. \"Good, wasn\'t\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,\" said Bolkonski.\n\n\"Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he\'s dined with him--the\npresent Emperor--more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met\na more cunning or subtle diplomatist--you know, a combination of\nFrench adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale\nabout him and Count Markov? Count Markov was the only man who knew how\nto handle him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is\ndelightful!\"\n\nAnd the talkative Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, now to Prince\nAndrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markov, our ambassador,\npurposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking\nat Markov, probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him, and how\nMarkov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up\nwithout touching Bonaparte\'s.\n\n\"Delightful!\" said Bolkonski. \"But I have come to you, Prince, as\na petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...\" but before\nPrince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon\nDolgorukov to the Emperor.\n\n\"Oh, what a nuisance,\" said Dolgorukov, getting up hurriedly and\npressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris. \"You know I should be\nvery glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young\nman.\" Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of\ngood-natured, sincere, and animated levity. \"But you see... another\ntime!\"\n\nBoris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher\npowers as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious\nthat here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the\nenormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt\nhimself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince\nDolgorukov out into the corridor and met--coming out of the door of\nthe Emperor\'s room by which Dolgorukov had entered--a short man in\ncivilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw\nwhich, without spoiling his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and\nshiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an\nintimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity,\nwalking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to\nstep out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity\nappeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the\nside of the corridor.\n\n\"Who was that?\" asked Boris.\n\n\"He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of\nmen--the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski.... It\nis such men as he who decide the fate of nations,\" added Bolkonski\nwith a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.\n\nNext day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle\nof Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either Prince Andrew or\nDolgorukov again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment.');

Rostov saw the\nCossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and\ninfantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then\nGenerals Bagration and Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants.\nAll the fear before action which he had experienced as previously, all\nthe inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of\ndistinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been\nwasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostov spent\nthat day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard\nfiring in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought\nback (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole\ndetachment of French cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sotnya\nof Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, though not big, had\nbeen a successful engagement. The men and officers returning spoke\nof a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and\nthe capture of a whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny\nafter a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day\nwas in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed, not only\nby the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful\nexpression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and\nadjutants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. And Nicholas, who\nhad vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent\nthat happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.\n\n\"Come here, Wostov. Let\'s dwink to dwown our gwief!\" shouted\nDenisov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some\nfood.\n\nThe officers gathered round Denisov\'s canteen, eating and talking.\n\n\"There! They are bringing another!\" cried one of the officers,\nindicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot\nby two Cossacks.\n\nOne of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he\nhad taken from the prisoner.\n\n\"Sell us that horse!\" Denisov called out to the Cossacks.\n\n\"If you like, your honor!\"\n\nThe officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.\nThe French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German\naccent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when\nhe heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,\naddressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been\ntaken, it was not his fault but the corporal\'s who had sent him to\nseize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were\nthere. And at every word he added: \"But don\'t hurt my little horse!\"\nand stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where\nhe was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now,\nimagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly\ndiscipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our\nrearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which\nwas so alien to us.\n\nThe Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostov, being\nthe richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought\nit.\n\n\"But don\'t hurt my little horse!\" said the Alsatian good-naturedly\nto Rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar.\n\nRostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.\n\n\"Alley! Alley!\" said the Cossack, touching the prisoner\'s arm to\nmake him go on.\n\n\"The Emperor! The Emperor!\" was suddenly heard among the hussars.\n\nAll began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up the road\nbehind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment\neveryone was in his place, waiting.\n\nRostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.\nInstantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected\nmood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every\nthought of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his\nnearness to the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made\nup to him for the day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the\nlonged-for moment of meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and\nwithout looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of his\napproach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the\napproaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything grew\nbrighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive around\nhim. Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding beams of\nmild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself\nenveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and\nmajestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with\nRostov\'s feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard\nthe Emperor\'s voice.\n\n\"The Pavlograd hussars?\" he inquired.\n\n\"The reserves, sire!\" replied a voice, a very human one compared\nto that which had said: \"The Pavlograd hussars?\"\n\nThe Emperor drew level with Rostov and halted. Alexander\'s face\nwas even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the\nreview. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that\nit suggested the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was\nthe face of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the\nsquadron, the Emperor\'s eyes met Rostov\'s and rested on them for not\nmore than two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was\ngoing on in Rostov\'s soul (it seemed to Rostov that he understood\neverything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two\nseconds into Rostov\'s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them.\nThen all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse\nwith his left foot, and galloped on.\n\nThe younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the\nbattle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at\ntwelve o\'clock left the third column with which he had been and\ngalloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars,\nseveral adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the\naction.\n\nThis battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron,\nwas represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the\nEmperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the\nbattlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were\nretreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had\npassed, the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau\nitself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the Emperor again. In the\nmarket place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the\nEmperor\'s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom\nthere had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his\nsuite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare,\na different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and\nbending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes\nand looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered\nhead. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his\nproximity to the Emperor shocked Rostov. Rostov saw how the\nEmperor\'s rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run\ndown them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse\'s\nside with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round\nunconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the\nsoldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been\nbrought. The soldier groaned.\n\n\"Gently, gently! Can\'t you do it more gently?\" said the Emperor\napparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.\n\nRostov saw tears filling the Emperor\'s eyes and heard him, as he was\nriding away, say to Czartoryski: \"What a terrible thing war is: what a\nterrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!\"\n\nThe troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within\nsight of the enemy\'s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to\nus at the least firing. The Emperor\'s gratitude was announced to the\nvanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double\nration of vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiers\' songs\nresounded even more merrily than on the previous night. Denisov\ncelebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rostov, who had\nalready drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor\'s\nhealth. \"Not \'our Sovereign, the Emperor,\' as they say at official\ndinners,\" said he, \"but the health of our Sovereign, that good,\nenchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the\ncertain defeat of the French!\"\n\n\"If we fought before,\" he said, \"not letting the French pass, as\nat Schon Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We\nwill all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not\nsaying it right, I have drunk a good deal--but that is how I feel, and\nso do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.\n\nAnd the old cavalry captain, Kirsten, shouted enthusiastically and\nno less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostov.\n\nWhen the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten\nfilled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand\nto the soldiers\' bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white\nchest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the\nlight of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.\n\n\"Lads! here\'s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our\nenemies! Hurrah!\" he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar\'s baritone.\n\nThe hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.\n\nLate that night, when all had separated, Denisov with his short hand\npatted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.\n\n\"As there\'s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he\'s fallen\nin love with the Tsar,\" he said.\n\n\"Denisov, don\'t make fun of it!\" cried Rostov. \"It is such a\nlofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\"\n\n\"I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\"\n\n\"No, you don\'t understand!\"\n\nAnd Rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming\nof what happiness it would be to die--not in saving the Emperor\'s life\n(he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before\nhis eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the\nRussian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only\nman to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding\nthe battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army\nwere then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the\nglory of the Russian arms.');

At headquarters and\namong the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was\nunwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around\nhim reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong\nimpression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and\nwounded.\n\nAt daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a\nflag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was\nbrought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The\nEmperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At\nmidday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off\nwith Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army.\n\nIt was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a\nmeeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a\npersonal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince\nDolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate\nwith Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were\nactuated by a real desire for peace.\n\nToward evening Dolgorukov came back, went straight to the Tsar,\nand remained alone with him for a long time.\n\nOn the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced\ntwo days\' march and the enemy\'s outposts after a brief interchange\nof shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the\nnineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted\ntill the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of\nAusterlitz was fought.\n\nTill midday on the nineteenth, the activity--the eager talk, running\nto and fro, and dispatching of adjutants--was confined to the\nEmperor\'s headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this\nactivity reached Kutuzov\'s headquarters and the staffs of the\ncommanders of columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread it to\nall ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth\nto the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from\ntheir bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the army swayed and started\nin one enormous mass six miles long.\n\nThe concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor\'s\nheadquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that\nfollowed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large\ntower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and\na third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and\ncogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands\nto advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity.\n\nJust as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the\nmilitary machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and\njust as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is\ntransmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse\nhas not yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage\none another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their\nmovement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though\nit were prepared to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment\ncomes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel\nbegins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of\nwhich are beyond its ken.\n\nJust as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of\ninnumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement\nof the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated\nhuman activities of 160,000 Russians and French--all their passions,\ndesires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride,\nfear, and enthusiasm--was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz,\nthe so-called battle of the three Emperors--that is to say, a slow\nmovement of the hand on the dial of human history.\n\nPrince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the\ncommander in chief.\n\nAt six in the evening, Kutuzov went to the Emperor\'s headquarters\nand after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand\nmarshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.\n\nBolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the\ncoming action from Dolgorukov. He felt that Kutuzov was upset and\ndissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were\ndissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor\'s headquarters\neveryone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something\nothers do not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorukov.\n\n\"Well, how d\'you do, my dear fellow?\" said Dolgorukov, who was\nsitting at tea with Bilibin. \"The fete is for tomorrow. How is your\nold fellow? Out of sorts?\"\n\n\"I won\'t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be\nheard.\"\n\n\"But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when\nhe talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when\nBonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have seen him?\" said Prince Andrew. \"Well, what is\nBonaparte like? How did he impress you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a\ngeneral engagement,\" repeated Dolgorukov, evidently prizing this\ngeneral conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with\nNapoleon. \"If he weren\'t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that\ninterview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat\nis so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is\nafraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!\"\n\n\"But tell me, what is he like, eh?\" said Prince Andrew again.\n\n\"He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him\n\'Your Majesty,\' but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me!\nThat\'s the sort of man he is, and nothing more,\" replied Dolgorukov,\nlooking round at Bilibin with a smile.\n\n\"Despite my great respect for old Kutuzov,\" he continued, \"we should\nbe a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a\nchance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in\nour hands! No, we mustn\'t forget Suvorov and his rule--not to put\nyourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe\nme in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than\nall the experience of old Cunctators.\"\n\n\"But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the\noutposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces\nare situated,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\nHe wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself\nformed.\n\n\"Oh, that is all the same,\" Dolgorukov said quickly, and getting\nup he spread a map on the table. \"All eventualities have been\nforeseen. If he is standing before Brunn...\"\n\nAnd Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother\'s\nplan of a flanking movement.\n\nPrince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which\nmight have been as good as Weyrother\'s, but for the disadvantage\nthat Weyrother\'s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew\nbegan to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his\nown plan, Prince Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed\nabsent-mindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrew\'s face.\n\n\"There will be a council of war at Kutuzov\'s tonight, though; you\ncan say all this there,\" remarked Dolgorukov.\n\n\"I will do so,\" said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.\n\n\"Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?\" said Bilibin, who,\ntill then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and\nnow was evidently ready with a joke. \"Whether tomorrow brings\nvictory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except\nyour Kutuzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column!\nThe commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le\nPrince de Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally\nPrishprish, and so on like all those Polish names.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, backbiter!\" said Dolgorukov. \"It is not true; there are\nnow two Russians, Miloradovich, and Dokhturov, and there would be a\nthird, Count Arakcheev, if his nerves were not too weak.\"\n\n\"However, I think General Kutuzov has come out,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\"I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!\" he added and went out\nafter shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin.\n\nOn the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking\nKutuzov, who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of\ntomorrow\'s battle.\n\nKutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause,\nreplied: \"I think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstoy\nand asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? \'But,\nmy dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after\nmilitary matters yourself!\' Yes... That was the answer I got!\"');

Weyrother evidently felt\nhimself to be at the head of a movement that had already become\nunrestrainable. He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a\nheavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not\nknow, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what\nthis movement might lead to. Weyrother had been twice that evening\nto the enemy\'s picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the\nEmperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his\nheadquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and\nnow, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutuzov\'s.\n\nHe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the\ncommander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and\nindistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, and did\nnot reply to questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had\na pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was\nhaughty and self-confident.\n\nKutuzov was occupying a nobleman\'s castle of modest dimensions\nnear Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the\ncommander in chief\'s office were gathered Kutuzov himself,\nWeyrother, and the members of the council of war. They were drinking\ntea, and only awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council. At last\nBagration\'s orderly came with the news that the prince could not\nattend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this\nand, availing himself of permission previously given him by Kutuzov to\nbe present at the council, he remained in the room.\n\n\"Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin,\" said\nWeyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on\nwhich an enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out.\n\nKutuzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged\nover his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low\nchair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms.\nAt the sound of Weyrother\'s voice, he opened his one eye with an\neffort.\n\n\"Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,\" said he, and\nnodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.\n\nIf at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was\npretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading\nthat followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was\nabsorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his\ncontempt for the dispositions or anything else--he was engaged in\nsatisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was\nasleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a\nmoment, glanced at Kutuzov and, having convinced himself that he was\nasleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous voice began to\nread out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading\nwhich he also read out:\n\n\"Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz\nand Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.\"\n\nThe dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began\nas follows:\n\n\"As the enemy\'s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right\nextends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there,\nwhile we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his\nright, it is advantageous to attack the enemy\'s latter wing especially\nif we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can\nboth fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between\nSchlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of\nSchlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy\'s front. For this\nobject it is necessary that... The first column marches... The\nsecond column marches... The third column marches...\" and so on,\nread Weyrother.\n\nThe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult\ndispositions. The tall, fair-haired General Buxhowden stood, leaning\nhis back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and\nseemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen.\nExactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed\nupon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy\nMiloradovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands\non his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent,\ngazing at Weyrother\'s face, and only turned away his eyes when the\nAustrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Miloradovich looked\nround significantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from\nthat significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied\nor not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron\nwho, with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French\nface during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate\nfingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on\nwhich was a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest sentences,\nhe stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and\nwith inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips\ninterrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the Austrian\ngeneral, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as\nif to say: \"You can tell me your views later, but now be so good as to\nlook at the map and listen.\" Langeron lifted his eyes with an\nexpression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking\nan explanation, but meeting the latter\'s impressive but meaningless\ngaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.\n\n\"A geography lesson!\" he muttered as if to himself, but loud\nenough to be heard.\n\nPrzebyszewski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his\nhand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in\nattention. Dohkturov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an\nassiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map\nconscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar\nlocality. He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had\nnot clearly heard and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother\ncomplied and Dohkturov noted them down.\n\nWhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron\nagain brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother\nor at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry\nout such a plan in which the enemy\'s position was assumed to be known,\nwhereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.\nLangeron\'s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief\naim was to show General Weyrother--who had read his dispositions with\nas much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children--that\nhe had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him\nsomething in military matters.\n\nWhen the monotonous sound of Weyrother\'s voice ceased, Kutuzov\nopened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the\nmill wheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if\nremarking, \"So you are still at that silly business!\" quickly closed\nhis eye again, and let his head sink still lower.\n\nLangeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother\'s\nvanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might\neasily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of\nthis plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a\nfirm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all\nobjections be they what they might.\n\n\"If he could attack us, he would have done so today,\" said he.\n\n\"So you think he is powerless?\" said Langeron.\n\n\"He has forty thousand men at most,\" replied Weyrother, with the\nsmile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the\ntreatment of a case.\n\n\"In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,\"\nsaid Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round\nfor support to Miloradovich who was near him.\n\nBut Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything\nrather than of what the generals were disputing about.\n\n\"Ma foi!\" said he, \"tomorrow we shall see all that on the\nbattlefield.\"\n\nWeyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it\nwas strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals\nand to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced\nhimself of, but had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.\n\n\"The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard\nfrom his camp,\" said he. \"What does that mean? Either he is\nretreating, which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing\nhis position.\" (He smiled ironically.) \"But even if he also took up\na position in the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of\ntrouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the\nsame.\"\n\n\"How is that?...\" began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting\nan opportunity to express his doubts.\n\nKutuzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the\ngenerals.\n\n\"Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow--or rather for today,\nfor it is past midnight--cannot now be altered,\" said he. \"You have\nheard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there\nis nothing more important...\" he paused, \"than to have a good sleep.\"\n\nHe moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was\npast midnight. Prince Andrew went out.\n\n\nThe council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to\nexpress his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy\nimpression. Whether Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov, Langeron,\nand the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were\nright--he did not know. \"But was it really not possible for Kutuzov to\nstate his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on account\nof court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and\nmy life, my life,\" he thought, \"must be risked?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,\" he\nthought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of\nmost distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he\nremembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he\nremembered the days when he first loved her. He thought of her\npregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously\nemotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was\nbilleted with Nesvitski and began to walk up and down before it.\n\nThe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed\nmysteriously. \"Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!\" he thought. \"Tomorrow\neverything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more,\nnone of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even\ncertainly, I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have\nto show all I can do.\" And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss,\nthe concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all\nthe commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he\nhad so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and\nclearly expresses his opinion to Kutuzov, to Weyrother, and to the\nEmperors. All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one\nundertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a\ndivision-stipulates that no one is to interfere with his\narrangements--leads his division to the decisive point, and gains the\nvictory alone. \"But death and suffering?\" suggested another voice.\nPrince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on dreaming\nof his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are planned by\nhim alone. Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzov\'s staff, but he\ndoes everything alone. The next battle is won by him alone. Kutuzov is\nremoved and he is appointed... \"Well and then?\" asked the other voice.\n\"If before that you are not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed,\nwell... what then?...\" \"Well then,\" Prince Andrew answered himself, \"I\ndon\'t know what will happen and don\'t want to know, and can\'t, but if\nI want this--want glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by\nthem, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and\nlive only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone,\nbut, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men\'s\nesteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family--I fear nothing. And\nprecious and dear as many persons are to me--father, sister,\nwife--those dearest to me--yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I\nwould give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over\nmen, of love from men I don\'t know and never shall know, for the love\nof these men here,\" he thought, as he listened to voices in Kutuzov\'s\ncourtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up;\none voice, probably a coachman\'s, was teasing Kutuzov\'s old cook whom\nPrince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, \"Tit, I\nsay, Tit!\"\n\n\"Well?\" returned the old man.\n\n\"Go, Tit, thresh a bit!\" said the wag.\n\n\"Oh, go to the devil!\" called out a voice, drowned by the laughter\nof the orderlies and servants.\n\n\"All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I\nvalue this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in\nthis mist!\"');

His hussars were placed along the\nline in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master\nthe sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with\nour army\'s campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind\nhim; in front of him was misty darkness. Rostov could see nothing,\npeer as he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray,\nnow there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer\nwhere the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in\nhis own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared--now\nthe Emperor, now Denisov, and now Moscow memories--and he again\nhurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears\nof the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six\npaces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was\nstill the same misty darkness. \"Why not?... It might easily happen,\"\nthought Rostov, \"that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as\nhe would to any other officer; he\'ll say: \'Go and find out what\'s\nthere.\' There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in\njust such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave\nme a place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him\nthe truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!\" And in order to\nrealize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign, Rostov pictured to\nhimself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill\nwith pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor.\nSuddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.\n\n\"Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and\nwatchword--shaft, Olmutz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in\nreserve tomorrow,\" he thought. \"I\'ll ask leave to go to the front,\nthis may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won\'t be long now\nbefore I am off duty. I\'ll take another turn and when I get back\nI\'ll go to the general and ask him.\" He readjusted himself in the\nsaddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars.\nIt seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a\nsloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as\nsteep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostov\ncould not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the\nmoon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought\nsomething moved on that white spot. \"I expect it\'s snow... that\nspot... a spot--une tache,\" he thought. \"There now... it\'s not a\ntache... Natasha... sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won\'t she be\nsurprised when I tell her how I\'ve seen the Emperor?) Natasha...\ntake my sabretache...\"--\"Keep to the right, your honor, there are\nbushes here,\" came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostov was riding\nin the act of falling asleep. Rostov lifted his head that had sunk\nalmost to his horse\'s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was\nsuccumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. \"But what\nwas I thinking? I mustn\'t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor?\nNo, that\'s not it--that\'s tomorrow. Oh yes! Natasha... sabretache...\nsaber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches.\nAlong the Tverskaya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought\nabout him too, just opposite Guryev\'s house... Old Guryev.... Oh,\nbut Denisov\'s a fine fellow. But that\'s all nonsense. The chief\nthing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to\nsay something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But\nthat\'s nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important\nthing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tasha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes!\nThat\'s right!\" And his head once more sank to his horse\'s neck. All at\nonce it seemed to him that he was being fired at. \"What? What?\nWhat?... Cut them down! What?...\" said Rostov, waking up. At the\nmoment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him, where the\nenemy was, the long-drawn shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and\nthe horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts.\nOver there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went\nout again, then another, and all along the French line on the hill\nfires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder. Rostov\ncould hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them.\nThe din of many voices was too great; all he could hear was: \"ahahah!\"\nand \"rrrr!\"\n\n\"What\'s that? What do you make of it?\" said Rostov to the hussar\nbeside him. \"That must be the enemy\'s camp!\"\n\nThe hussar did not reply.\n\n\"Why, don\'t you hear it?\" Rostov asked again, after waiting for a\nreply.\n\n\"Who can tell, your honor?\" replied the hussar reluctantly.\n\n\"From the direction, it must be the enemy,\" repeated Rostov.\n\n\"It may be he or it may be nothing,\" muttered the hussar. \"It\'s\ndark... Steady!\" he cried to his fidgeting horse.\n\nRostov\'s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,\npricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting\ngrew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army\nof several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and\nfarther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rostov no\nlonger wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy\narmy had a stimulating effect on him. \"Vive l\'Empereur! L\'Empereur!\"\nhe now heard distinctly.\n\n\"They can\'t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,\" he said to\nthe hussar beside him.\n\nThe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The\nsound of horse\'s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars\nwas heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of\nhussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.\n\n\"Your honor, the generals!\" said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov.\n\nRostov, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode\nwith the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the\nline. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov\nwith their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the\nlights and shouts in the enemy\'s camp. Rostov rode up to Bagration,\nreported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the\ngenerals were saying.\n\n\"Believe me,\" said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, \"it is\nnothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to\nkindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Bagration. \"I saw them this evening on that knoll; if\nthey had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too....\nOfficer!\" said Bagration to Rostov, \"are the enemy\'s skirmishers still\nthere?\"\n\n\"They were there this evening, but now I don\'t know, your\nexcellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?\" replied\nRostov.\n\nBagration stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostov\'s face\nin the mist.\n\n\"Well, go and see,\" he said, after a pause.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nRostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other\nhussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the\ndirection from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and\npleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and\ndangerous misty distance where no one had been before him. Bagration\ncalled to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostov\npretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on,\ncontinually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and\ncontinually discovering his mistakes. Having descended the hill at a\ntrot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy\'s fires, but\nheard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. In the\nvalley he saw before him something like a river, but when he reached\nit he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road he reined\nin his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride\nover the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which\ngleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be\neasier to see people coming along it. \"Follow me!\" said he, crossed\nthe road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point\nwhere the French pickets had been standing that evening.\n\n\"Your honor, there he is!\" cried one of the hussars behind him.\nAnd before Rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that\nhad suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a\nreport, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive\nsound passed out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in\nthe pan. Rostov turned his horse and galloped back. Four more\nreports followed at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the\nfog singing in different tones. Rostov reined in his horse, whose\nspirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and went back at a\nfootpace. \"Well, some more! Some more!\" a merry voice was saying in\nhis soul. But no more shots came.\n\nOnly when approaching Bagration did Rostov let his horse gallop\nagain, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.\n\nDolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had\nonly lit fires to deceive us.\n\n\"What does that prove?\" he was saying as Rostov rode up. \"They might\nretreat and leave the pickets.\"\n\n\"It\'s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,\" said\nBagration. \"Wait till tomorrow morning, we\'ll find out everything\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was\nin the evening,\" reported Rostov, stooping forward with his hand at\nthe salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his\nride and especially by the sound of the bullets.\n\n\"Very good, very good,\" said Bagration. \"Thank you, officer.\"\n\n\"Your excellency,\" said Rostov, \"may I ask a favor?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached\nto the first squadron?\"\n\n\"What\'s your name?\"\n\n\"Count Rostov.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.\"\n\n\"Count Ilya Rostov\'s son?\" asked Dolgorukov.\n\nBut Rostov did not reply.\n\n\"Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?\"\n\n\"I will give the order.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the\nEmperor,\" thought Rostov.\n\n\"Thank God!\"\n\n\nThe fires and shouting in the enemy\'s army were occasioned by the\nfact that while Napoleon\'s proclamation was being read to the troops\nthe Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing\nhim, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, \"Vive\nl\'Empereur!\" Napoleon\'s proclamation was as follows:\n\n\nSoldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the\nAustrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at\nHollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position\nwe occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round\nme on the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will\nmyself direct your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with\nyour habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy\'s\nranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see\nyour Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for\nthere must be no doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is\nat stake is the honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the\nhonor of our nation.\n\nDo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let\nevery man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these\nhirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This\nvictory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter\nquarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France\nwill join us, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my\npeople, of you, and of myself.\n\nNAPOLEON');

The troops of the\ncenter, the reserves, and Bagration\'s right flank had not yet moved,\nbut on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,\nwhich were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French\nright flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to\nplan, were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into\nwhich they were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes\nsmart. It was cold and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking\ntea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a\ntattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the fires\nthrowing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels,\ntubs, and everything that they did not want or could not carry away\nwith them. Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the\nRussian troops and served as heralds of the advance. As soon as an\nAustrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer\'s\nquarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers ran from the fires,\nthrust their pipes into their boots, their bags into the carts, got\ntheir muskets ready, and formed rank. The officers buttoned up their\ncoats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and moved along the\nranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed\nthe wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and\nregimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final\ninstructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who\nremained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet\nresounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and\nunable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog,\nto see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were\ngoing.\n\nA soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his\nregiment as much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has\nwalked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches,\njust as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and\nrigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same\ncomrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the\nsame company dog Jack, and the same commanders. The sailor rarely\ncares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing, but on the\nday of battle--heaven knows how and whence--a stern note of which\nall are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army,\nannouncing the approach of something decisive and solemn, and\nawakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of battle the\nsoldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their\nregiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning\nwhat is going on around them.\n\nThe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they\ncould not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and\nlevel ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one\nmight encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns\nadvanced for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and\nascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and\nunknown ground, and nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary,\nthe soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides,\nother Russian columns were moving in the same direction. Every soldier\nfelt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going, many\nmore of our men were going too.\n\n\"There now, the Kurskies have also gone past,\" was being said in the\nranks.\n\n\"It\'s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last\nnight I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A\nregular Moscow!\"\n\nThough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or\ntalked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war,\nwere out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not\nexert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the\norders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going\ninto action, especially to an attack. But when they had marched for\nabout an hour in the dense fog, the greater part of the men had to\nhalt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder\nspread through the ranks. How such a consciousness is communicated\nis very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated very\nsurely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as\nwater does in a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any\nallies, it might perhaps have been a long time before this\nconsciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as\nit was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the\nstupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had\nbeen occasioned by the sausage eaters.\n\n\"Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up\nagainst the French?\"\n\n\"No, one can\'t hear them. They\'d be firing if we had.\"\n\n\"They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in\nthe middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It\'s all those damned\nGermans\' muddling! What stupid devils!\"\n\n\"Yes, I\'d send them on in front, but no fear, they\'re crowding up\nbehind. And now here we stand hungry.\"\n\n\"I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking\nthe way,\" said an officer.\n\n\"Ah, those damned Germans! They don\'t know their own country!\"\nsaid another.\n\n\"What division are you?\" shouted an adjutant, riding up.\n\n\"The Eighteenth.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you\nwon\'t get there till evening.\"\n\n\"What stupid orders! They don\'t themselves know what they are\ndoing!\" said the officer and rode off.\n\nThen a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.\n\n\"Tafa-lafa! But what he\'s jabbering no one can make out,\" said a\nsoldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. \"I\'d shoot them,\nthe scoundrels!\"\n\n\"We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven\'t\ngot halfway. Fine orders!\" was being repeated on different sides.\n\nAnd the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to\nturn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the\nGermans.\n\nThe cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was\nmoving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center\nwas too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all\nordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in\nfront of the infantry, who had to wait.\n\nAt the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a\nRussian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry\nshould be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher\ncommand, was to blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and\ndispirited. After an hour\'s delay they at last moved on, descending\nthe hill. The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more\ndensely below, where they were descending. In front in the fog a\nshot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at varying\nintervals--trata... tat--and then more and more regularly and rapidly,\nand the action at the Goldbach Stream began.\n\nNot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having\nstumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their\ncommanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading\nthrough the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front\nor around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the\nenemy lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders\nfrom the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in\nthose unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this\nway the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which\nhad gone down into the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutuzov\nwas, stood on the Pratzen Heights.\n\nBelow, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog;\non the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of\nwhat was going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we\nsupposed, six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea\nof mist, no one knew till after eight o\'clock.\n\nIt was nine o\'clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a\nsea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where\nNapoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above\nhim was a clear blue sky, and the sun\'s vast orb quivered like a\nhuge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist.\nThe whole French army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff,\nwere not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and\nSchlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and\nbegin the action, but were on this side, so close to our own forces\nthat Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man\nfrom one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his\nItalian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front\nof his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise\nout of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving\nin the distance, and he listened to the sounds of firing in the\nvalley. Not a single muscle of his face--which in those days was still\nthin--moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His\npredictions were being justified. Part of the Russian force had\nalready descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and\npart were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack\nand regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that\nin a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian\ncolumns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one\ndirection toward the valley and disappearing one after another into\nthe mist. From information he had received the evening before, from\nthe sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the\nnight, by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all\nindications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far\naway in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen\nconstituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center was\nalready sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still\nhe did not begin the engagement.\n\nToday was a great day for him--the anniversary of his coronation.\nBefore dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and\nin good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in\nthat happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything\nsucceeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above\nthe mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident,\nself-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily\nin love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his\nattention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun\nfloating up out of the mist.\n\nWhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and\nmist were aglow with dazzling light--as if he had only awaited this to\nbegin the action--he drew the glove from his shapely white hand,\nmade a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to\nbegin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in\ndifferent directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of\nthe French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which\nwere being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving down the\nvalley to their left.');

The locality and the position of our troops were known to\nhim as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. His own\nstrategic plan, which obviously could not now be carried out, was\nforgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother\'s plan, Prince Andrew\nconsidered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as\nmight call for his rapidity of perception and decision.\n\nTo the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen\nforces could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight\nwould concentrate. \"There we shall encounter difficulties, and there,\"\nthought he, \"I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there,\nstandard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of\nme.\"\n\nHe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.\nSeeing them he kept thinking, \"That may be the very standard with\nwhich I shall lead the army.\"\n\nIn the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights\nwas a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay\nlike a milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left\ninto which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of\nfiring. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the\nvast orb of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that\nsea of mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there\nthe enemy probably was, for something could be descried. On the\nright the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of\nhoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the left\nbeyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared\nin the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The\ncommander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting\nthe troops pass by him. That morning Kutuzov seemed worn and\nirritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt without\nany command being given, apparently obstructed by something in front.\n\n\"Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the\nvillage!\" he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. \"Don\'t you\nunderstand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile\nthrough narrow village streets when we are marching against the\nenemy?\"\n\n\"I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,\"\nanswered the general.\n\nKutuzov laughed bitterly.\n\n\"You\'ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!\nVery fine!\"\n\n\"The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the\ndispositions...\"\n\n\"The dispositions!\" exclaimed Kutuzov bitterly. \"Who told you\nthat?... Kindly do as you are ordered.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" Nesvitski whispered to Prince Andrew, \"the old man\nis as surly as a dog.\"\n\nAn Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his\nhat galloped up to Kutuzov and asked in the Emperor\'s name had the\nfourth column advanced into action.\n\nKutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to\nfall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutuzov\'s\nmalevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that\nwhat was being done was not his adjutant\'s fault, and still not\nanswering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski.\n\n\"Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed\nthe village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.\"\n\nHardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.\n\n\"And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,\" he added. \"What\nare they doing? What are they doing?\" he murmured to himself, still\nnot replying to the Austrian.\n\nPrince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.\n\nOvertaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped\nthe third division and convinced himself that there really were no\nsharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of\nthe regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief\'s order to\nthrow out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were\nother troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six\nmiles away. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a\nbarren descent hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the\ncommander in chief\'s name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew\ngalloped back. Kutuzov still in the same place, his stout body resting\nheavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily\nwith closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood with the\nbutts of their muskets on the ground.\n\n\"All right, all right!\" he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a\ngeneral who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all\nthe left-flank columns had already descended.\n\n\"Plenty of time, your excellency,\" muttered Kutuzov in the midst\nof a yawn. \"Plenty of time,\" he repeated.\n\nJust then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound of\nregiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole\nextended line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person\nthey were greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the\nregiment in front of which Kutuzov was standing began to shout, he\nrode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. Along the\nroad from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen\nin various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side in front, at full\ngallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a\nbobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode\na black one. These were the two Emperors followed by their suites.\nKutuzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave\nthe command \"Attention!\" and rode up to the Emperors with a salute.\nHis whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on\nthe air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an\naffectation of respect which evidently struck Alexander\nunpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.\n\nThis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy\nface of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and\nvanished. After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than\non the field of Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for the first time\nabroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty\nand mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the\nsame capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance\nof goodhearted innocent youth.\n\nAt the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed\nbrighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping\ntwo miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked\nround at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own.\nCzartoryski, Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, and the others,\nall richly dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh,\nonly slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had\nstopped behind the Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced\nyoung man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about\nhim in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his\nwhite adjutants and asked some question--\"Most likely he is asking\nat what o\'clock they started,\" thought Prince Andrew, watching his old\nacquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his\nreception at Brunn. In the Emperors\' suite were the picked young\norderly officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and\nAustrian. Among them were grooms leading the Tsar\'s beautiful relay\nhorses covered with embroidered cloths.\n\nAs when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields\nenters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and\nconfidence of success reached Kutuzov\'s cheerless staff with the\ngalloping advent of all these brilliant young men.\n\n\"Why aren\'t you beginning, Michael Ilarionovich?\" said the Emperor\nAlexander hurriedly to Kutuzov, glancing courteously at the same\ntime at the Emperor Francis.\n\n\"I am waiting, Your Majesty,\" answered Kutuzov, bending forward\nrespectfully.\n\nThe Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had\nnot quite heard.\n\n\"Waiting, Your Majesty,\" repeated Kutuzov. (Prince Andrew noted that\nKutuzov\'s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word\n\"waiting.\") \"Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his\nrather round shoulders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was near him, as\nif complaining of Kutuzov.\n\n\"You know, Michael Ilarionovich, we are not on the\nEmpress\' Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are\nassembled,\" said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor\nFrancis, as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to\nwhat he was saying. But the Emperor Francis continued to look about\nhim and did not listen.\n\n\"That is just why I do not begin, sire,\" said Kutuzov in a\nresounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not\nbeing heard, and again something in his face twitched--\"That is just\nwhy I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on\nthe Empress\' Field,\" said clearly and distinctly.\n\nIn the Emperor\'s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed\ndissatisfaction and reproach. \"Old though he may be, he should not, he\ncertainly should not, speak like that,\" their glances seemed to say.\n\nThe Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutuzov\'s eye\nwaiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutuzov,\nwith respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence\nlasted for about a minute.\n\n\"However, if you command it, Your Majesty,\" said Kutuzov, lifting\nhis head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning,\nbut submissive general.\n\nHe touched his horse and having called Miloradovich, the commander\nof the column, gave him the order to advance.\n\nThe troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Novgorod\nand one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.\n\nAs this Apsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Miloradovich,\nwithout his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous\ntuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners\nfront and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing\nsalute reined in his horse before the Emperor.\n\n\"God be with you, general!\" said the Emperor.\n\n\"Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite,\nsire,\"* he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among\nthe gentlemen of the Tsar\'s suite by his poor French.\n\n\n*\"Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to do, Sire.\"\n\n\nMiloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a\nlittle behind the Emperor. The Apsheron men, excited by the Tsar\'s\npresence, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a\nbold, brisk pace.\n\n\"Lads!\" shouted Miloradovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery\nvoice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect\nof battle, and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons, his comrades\nin Suvorov\'s time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors,\nthat he forgot the sovereigns\' presence. \"Lads, it\'s not the first\nvillage you\'ve had to take,\" cried he.\n\n\"Glad to do our best!\" shouted the soldiers.\n\nThe Emperor\'s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had\ncarried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the\nfield of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot\nand pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the\nEmpress\' Field, not understanding the significance of the firing,\nnor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis\' black cob, nor of all that\nwas being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.\n\nThe Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a\nremark to him, pointing to the gallant Apsherons.');

Both of them led downhill and troops\nwere marching along both.\n\nThe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly\nvisible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down\nbelow, on the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutuzov had\nstopped and was speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who\nwas a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask\nhim for a field glass.\n\n\"Look, look!\" said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the\ndistance, but down the hill before him. \"It\'s the French!\"\n\nThe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass,\ntrying to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their\nfaces suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to\nbe a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly\nappeared just in front of us.\n\n\"It\'s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But\nhow is that?\" said different voices.\n\nWith the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not\nmore than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing, a\ndense French column coming up to meet the Apsherons.\n\n\"Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,\"\nthought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutuzov.\n\n\"The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency,\" cried he. But at\nthat very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was\nheard quite close at hand, and a voice of naive terror barely two\nsteps from Prince Andrew shouted, \"Brothers! All\'s lost!\" And at\nthis as if at a command, everyone began to run.\n\nConfused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where\nfive minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would\nit have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible\nnot to be carried back with it oneself. Bolkonski only tried not to\nlose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp\nwhat was happening in front of him. Nesvitski with an angry face,\nred and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did not\nride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutuzov\nremained in the same place and without answering drew out a\nhandkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced\nhis way to him.\n\n\"You are wounded?\" he asked, hardly able to master the trembling\nof his lower jaw.\n\n\"The wound is not here, it is there!\" said Kutuzov, pressing the\nhandkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing\nsoldiers. \"Stop them!\" he shouted, and at the same moment, probably\nrealizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and\nrode to the right.\n\nA fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.\n\nThe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by\nthem it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, \"Get on! Why\nare you hindering us?\" Another in the same place turned round and\nfired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutuzov himself rode.\nHaving by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of\nmen, Kutuzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward\na sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the\ncrowd of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzov, saw on\nthe slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was\nstill firing and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some\nRussian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery nor\nbackward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself\nfrom the infantry and approached Kutuzov. Of Kutuzov\'s suite only four\nremained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.\n\n\"Stop those wretches!\" gasped Kutuzov to the regimental commander,\npointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to\npunish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment\nand across Kutuzov\'s suite like a flock of little birds.\n\nThe French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were firing\nat him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his\nleg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding\nthe flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on\nthe muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing\nwithout orders.\n\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked around....\n\"Bolkonski!\" he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of\nthe feebleness of age, \"Bolkonski!\" he whispered, pointing to the\ndisordered battalion and at the enemy, \"what\'s that?\"\n\nBut before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of\nshame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and\nrun to the standard.\n\n\"Forward, lads!\" he shouted in a voice piercing as a child\'s.\n\n\"Here it is!\" thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and\nhearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.\nSeveral soldiers fell.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the\nheavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole\nbattalion would follow him.\n\nAnd really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then\nanother and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting \"Hurrah!\"\nand overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag\nthat was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew\'s hands, but he\nwas immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,\ndragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw\nour artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having\nabandoned their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French\ninfantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning\nthe guns round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within\ntwenty paces of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above\nhim unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually\ngroaned and dropped. But he did not look at them: he looked only at\nwhat was going on in front of him--at the battery. He now saw\nclearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry,\npulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other.\nHe could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the\nfaces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they were\ndoing.\n\n\"What are they about?\" thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.\n\"Why doesn\'t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why\ndoesn\'t the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the\nFrenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....\"\n\nAnd really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to\nthe struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had\ntriumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited\nhim, was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it\nended. It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him\non the head with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but\nthe worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his\nseeing what he had been looking at.\n\n\"What\'s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,\" thought he, and\nfell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle\nof the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner\nhad been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or\nsaved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the\nsky--the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with\ngray clouds gliding slowly across it. \"How quiet, peaceful, and\nsolemn; not at all as I ran,\" thought Prince Andrew--\"not as we ran,\nshouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with\nfrightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do\nthose clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did\nnot see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it\nat last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite\nsky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even it does not\nexist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank God!...\"');

Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov\'s\ndemand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility\nfrom himself, Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgorukov to send to\ninquire of the commander in chief. Bagration knew that as the distance\nbetween the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the\nmessenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), and found\nthe commander in chief (which would be very difficult), he would not\nbe able to get back before evening.\n\nBagration cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his\nsuite, and the boyish face Rostov, breathless with excitement and\nhope, was the first to catch his eye. He sent him.\n\n\"And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in\nchief, your excellency?\" said Rostov, with his hand to his cap.\n\n\"You can give the message to His Majesty,\" said Dolgorukov,\nhurriedly interrupting Bagration.\n\nOn being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few\nhours\' sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute,\nwith elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and\ngenerally in that state of mind which makes everything seem\npossible, pleasant, and easy.\n\nAll his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be\na general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he\nwas orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going\nwith a message to Kutuzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself.\nThe morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart\nwas full of joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his\nhorse the rein and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the\nline of Bagration\'s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but\nwere standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by\nUvarov\'s cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation\nfor battle; having passed Uvarov\'s cavalry he clearly heard the\nsound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder\nand louder.\n\nIn the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket\nshots at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two\ncannon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the\nhill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon\nthat sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but\nmerged into a general roar.\n\nHe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one\nanother down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling,\nspreading, and mingling with one another. He could also, by the\ngleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of\ninfantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons.\n\nRostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was\ngoing on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand\nor make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men\nof some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of\ntroops; but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make\nout. These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating\neffect on him; on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and\ndetermination.\n\n\"Go on! Go on! Give it them!\" he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,\nand again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther\nand farther into the region where the army was already in action.\n\n\"How it will be there I don\'t know, but all will be well!\" thought\nRostov.\n\nAfter passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part\nof the line (the Guards) was already in action.\n\n\"So much the better! I shall see it close,\" he thought.\n\nHe was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came\ngalloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks\nwere returning from the attack. Rostov got out of their way,\ninvoluntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.\n\n\"That is no business of mine,\" he thought. He had not ridden many\nhundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole\nwidth of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white\nuniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and\nacross his path. Rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the\nway of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at\nthe same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of\nthe horses were already galloping. Rostov heard the thud of their\nhoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their\nfigures, and even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our\nHorse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming\nto meet them.\n\nThe Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their\nhorses. Rostov could already see their faces and heard the command:\n\"Charge!\" shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to\nfull speed. Rostov, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack\non the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go,\nbut still was not in time to avoid them.\n\nThe last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned\nangrily on seeing Rostov before him, with whom he would inevitably\ncollide. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostov and his\nBedouin over (Rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to\nthese gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rostov to\nflourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman\'s horse. The\nheavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its\nears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in\nviolently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its neck,\ngalloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostov\nbefore he heard them shout, \"Hurrah!\" and looking back saw that\ntheir foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with\nred epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing more, for\nimmediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke\nenveloped everything.\n\nAt that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him,\ndisappeared in the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after\nthem or to go where he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of\nthe Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves. Rostov was\nhorrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome\nmen, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had\ngalloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were\nleft after the charge.\n\n\"Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall\nsee the Emperor immediately!\" thought Rostov and galloped on.\n\nWhen he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them\nand around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so\nmuch because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on\nthe soldiers\' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the\nofficers.\n\nPassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he\nheard a voice calling him by name.\n\n\"Rostov!\"\n\n\"What?\" he answered, not recognizing Boris.\n\n\"I say, we\'ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!\" said\nBoris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have\nbeen under fire for the first time.\n\nRostov stopped.\n\n\"Have you?\" he said. \"Well, how did it go?\"\n\n\"We drove them back!\" said Boris with animation, growing\ntalkative. \"Can you imagine it?\" and he began describing how the\nGuards, having taken up their position and seeing troops before\nthem, thought they were Austrians, and all at once discovered from the\ncannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in\nthe front line and had unexpectedly to go into action. Rostov\nwithout hearing Boris to the end spurred his horse.\n\n\"Where are you off to?\" asked Boris.\n\n\"With a message to His Majesty.\"\n\n\"There he is!\" said Boris, thinking Rostov had said \"His\nHighness,\" and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high\nshoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in\nhis helmet and Horse Guards\' jacket, shouting something to a pale,\nwhite uniformed Austrian officer.\n\n\"But that\'s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the\nEmperor,\" said Rostov, and was about to spur his horse.\n\n\"Count! Count!\" shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager\nas Boris. \"Count! I am wounded in my right hand\" (and he showed his\nbleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) \"and I remained at\nthe front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family--the\nvon Bergs--have been knights!\"\n\nHe said something more, but Rostov did not wait to hear it and\nrode away.\n\nHaving passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostov, to\navoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the\nHorse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round\nthe place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard.\nSuddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind\nour troops, where he could never have expected the enemy to be.\n\n\"What can it be?\" he thought. \"The enemy in the rear of our army?\nImpossible!\" And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself\nand for the issue of the whole battle. \"But be that what it may,\" he\nreflected, \"there is no riding round it now. I must look for the\ncommander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish\nwith the rest.\"\n\nThe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostov was more\nand more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the\nvillage of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.\n\n\"What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is\nfiring?\" Rostov kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian\nsoldiers running in confused crowds across his path.\n\n\"The devil knows! They\'ve killed everybody!

But neither they nor a single commanding officer\nwere there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He\nurged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but\nthe farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on\nwhich he had come out was thronged with caleches, carriages of all\nsorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and\nsome not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the\ndismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries\nstationed on the Pratzen Heights.\n\n\"Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutuzov?\" Rostov kept asking\neveryone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.\n\nAt last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.\n\n\"Eh, brother! They\'ve all bolted long ago!\" said the soldier,\nlaughing for some reason and shaking himself free.\n\nHaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostov stopped the\nhorse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to\nquestion him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a\ncarriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and\nthat he was dangerously wounded.\n\n\"It can\'t be!\" said Rostov. \"It must have been someone else.\"\n\n\"I saw him myself,\" replied the man with a self-confident smile of\nderision. \"I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I\'ve\nseen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat\nin the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black\nhorses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It\'s time I knew the\nImperial horses and Ilya Ivanych. I don\'t think Ilya drives anyone\nexcept the Tsar!\"\n\nRostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a\nwounded officer passing by addressed him:\n\n\"Who is it you want?\" he asked. \"The commander in chief? He was\nkilled by a cannon ball--struck in the breast before our regiment.\"\n\n\"Not killed--wounded!\" another officer corrected him.\n\n\"Who? Kutuzov?\" asked Rostov.\n\n\"Not Kutuzov, but what\'s his name--well, never mind... there are not\nmany left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders\nare there,\" said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,\nand he walked on.\n\nRostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now\ngoing. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible\nto doubt it now. Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him, in\nwhich he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now\nto say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov, even if they were alive and\nunwounded?\n\n\"Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!\" a\nsoldier shouted to him. \"They\'d kill you there!\"\n\n\"Oh, what are you talking about?\" said another. \"Where is he to\ngo? That way is nearer.\"\n\nRostov considered, and then went in the direction where they said he\nwould be killed.\n\n\"It\'s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to\nsave myself?\" he thought. He rode on to the region where the\ngreatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The\nFrench had not yet occupied that region, and the Russians--the\nuninjured and slightly wounded--had left it long ago. All about the\nfield, like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to\nfifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. The wounded crept\ntogether in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing\nscreams and groans, sometimes feigned--or so it seemed to Rostov. He\nput his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and\nhe felt afraid--afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed\nand which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates.\n\nThe French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and\nwounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an\nadjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several\nshots. The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the\ncorpses around him merged in Rostov\'s mind into a single feeling of\nterror and pity for himself. He remembered his mother\'s last letter.\n\"What would she feel,\" thought he, \"if she saw me here now on this\nfield with the cannon aimed at me?\"\n\nIn the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from\nthe field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less\ndisordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry\nfire sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the\nbattle was lost. No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the\nEmperor or Kutuzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was\nwounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false\nrumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor\'s carriage had\nreally galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified\nOber-Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the\nbattlefield with others in the Emperor\'s suite. One officer told\nRostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village\nto the left, and thither Rostov rode, not hoping to find anyone but\nmerely to ease his conscience. When he had ridden about two miles\nand had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a\nkitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing\nthe ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to\nRostov; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rostov\nfancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse\nwith his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a\nlittle earth crumbled from the bank under the horse\'s hind hoofs.\nTurning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and\ndeferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes,\nevidently suggesting that he should do the same. The rider, whose\nfigure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted his\nattention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by\nthat gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored\nmonarch.\n\n\"But it can\'t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!\"\nthought Rostov. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostov\nsaw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory.\nThe Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the\ncharm, the mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostov was\nhappy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded\nwere false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and\neven ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgorukov had\nordered him to deliver.\n\nBut as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter\nthe thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help\nor a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and\nhe is alone with her, so Rostov, now that he had attained what he\nhad longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know\nhow to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him\nwhy it would be inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.\n\n\"What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of\nhis being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant\nor painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to\nhim now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere\nsight of him?\" Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the\nEmperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall.\nThose speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for\nthe most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph,\ngenerally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked\nhim for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his\nactions had proved.\n\n\"Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the\nright flank now that it is nearly four o\'clock and the battle is lost?\nNo, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his\nreflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind\nlook or bad opinion from him,\" Rostov decided; and sorrowfully and\nwith a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at\nthe Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.\n\nWhile Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,\nCaptain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the\nEmperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him\nto cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling\nunwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.\nRostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke\nlong and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,\ncovered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll\'s hand.\n\n\"And I might have been in his place!\" thought Rostov, and hardly\nrestraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter\ndespair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.\n\nHis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness\nwas the cause of his grief.\n\nHe might... not only might but should, have gone up to the\nsovereign. It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the\nEmperor and he had not made use of it.... \"What have I done?\"\nthought he. And he turned round and galloped back to the place where\nhe had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now.\nOnly some carts and carriages were passing by. From one of the drivers\nhe learned that Kutuzov\'s staff were not far off, in the village the\nvehicles were going to. Rostov followed them. In front of him walked\nKutuzov\'s groom leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and\nbehind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked\ncap and sheepskin coat.\n\n\"Tit! I say, Tit!\" said the groom.\n\n\"What?\" answered the old man absent-mindedly.\n\n\"Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!\"\n\n\"Oh, you fool!\" said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed\nin silence, and then the same joke was repeated.\n\n\nBefore five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points.\nMore than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.\n\nPrzebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other\ncolumns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly\nconfused masses.\n\nThe remains of Langeron\'s and Dokhturov\'s mingled forces were\ncrowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of\nAugesd.\n\nAfter five o\'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot\ncannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from\nnumerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights,\ndirected at our retreating forces.\n\nIn the rearguard, Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept\nup a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops.\nIt was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many\nyears the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap\npeacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled\nup, handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on\nthat dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and\nblue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with\nwheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts--on that\nnarrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses\' hoofs and\nbetween the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now\ncrowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying\nand killing one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed\nthemselves in the same way.\n\nEvery ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around,\nor a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and\nsplashing with blood those near them.\n\nDolokhov--now an officer--wounded in the arm, and on foot, with\nthe regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,\nrepresented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by\nthe crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and,\njammed in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had\nfallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon\nball killed someone behind them, another fell in front and splashed\nDolokhov with blood. The crowd, pushing forward desperately,\nsqueezed together, moved a few steps, and again stopped.\n\n\"Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here\nanother two minutes and it is certain death,\" thought each one.\n\nDolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the\nedge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto\nthe slippery ice that covered the millpool.\n\n\"Turn this way!\" he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked\nunder him; \"turn this way!\" he shouted to those with the gun. \"It\nbears!...\"\n\nThe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it\nwould give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon\neven under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to\nthe bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at\nthe entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to\naddress Dolokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd\nthat everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general\nfell from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or\nthought of raising him.\n\n\"Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don\'t you hear? Go\non!\" innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the\ngeneral, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were\nshouting.\n\nOne of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto\nthe ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen\npond. The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg\nslipped into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to\nhis waist. The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped\nhis horse, but from behind still came the shouts: \"Onto the ice, why\ndo you stop? Go on! Go on!\" And cries of horror were heard in the\ncrowd. The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the\nhorses to make them turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank.\nThe ice, that had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass,\nand some forty men who were on it dashed, some forward and some\nback, drowning one another.\n\nStill the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop\nonto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd\nthat covered the dam, the pond, and the bank.');

He did\nnot know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt\nthat he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his\nhead.\n\n\"Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw\ntoday?\" was his first thought. \"And I did not know this suffering\neither,\" he thought. \"Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all\ntill now. But where am I?\"\n\nHe listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices\nspeaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same\nlofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher,\nand between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and\ndid not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had\nridden up and stopped near him.\n\nIt was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding\nover the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the\nbatteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and\nwounded left on the field.\n\n\"Fine men!\" remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian\ngrenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened\nnape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.\n\n\"The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your\nMajesty,\" said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were\nfiring at Augesd.\n\n\"Have some brought from the reserve,\" said Napoleon, and having gone\non a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back\nwith the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had\nalready been taken by the French as a trophy.)\n\n\"That\'s a fine death!\" said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski.\n\nPrince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was\nNapoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he\nheard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not\nonly did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at\nonce forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to\ndeath, and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He\nknew it was Napoleon--his hero--but at that moment Napoleon seemed\nto him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was\npassing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the\nclouds flying over it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who\nmight be standing over him, or what was said of him; he was only\nglad that people were standing near him and only wished that they\nwould help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so\nbeautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so\ndifferently. He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound.\nHe feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused\nhis own pity.\n\n\"Ah! He is alive,\" said Napoleon. \"Lift this young man up and\ncarry him to the dressing station.\"\n\nHaving said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who,\nhat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the\nvictory.\n\nPrince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from\nthe terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting\nwhile being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing\nstation. He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when\nwith other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the\nhospital. During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was\nable to look about him and even speak.\n\nThe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a\nFrench convoy officer, who said rapidly: \"We must halt here: the\nEmperor will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these\ngentlemen prisoners.\"\n\n\"There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,\nthat he is probably tired of them,\" said another officer.\n\n\"All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor\nAlexander\'s Guards,\" said the first one, indicating a Russian\nofficer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.\n\nBolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg\nsociety. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of\nthe Horse Guards.\n\nBonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.\n\n\"Which is the senior?\" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.\n\nThey named the colonel, Prince Repnin.\n\n\"You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander\'s regiment of\nHorse Guards?\" asked Napoleon.\n\n\"I commanded a squadron,\" replied Repnin.\n\n\"Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,\" said Napoleon.\n\n\"The praise of a great commander is a soldier\'s highest reward,\"\nsaid Repnin.\n\n\"I bestow it with pleasure,\" said Napoleon. \"And who is that young\nman beside you?\"\n\nPrince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.\n\nAfter looking at him Napoleon smiled.\n\n\"He\'s very young to come to meddle with us.\"\n\n\"Youth is no hindrance to courage,\" muttered Sukhtelen in a\nfailing voice.\n\n\"A splendid reply!\" said Napoleon. \"Young man, you will go far!\"\n\nPrince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the\nEmperor\'s eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to\nattract his attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on\nthe battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet \"young\nman\" that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Well, and you, young man,\" said he. \"How do you feel, mon brave?\"\n\nThough five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few\nwords to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed\nstraight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that\nmoment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so\nmean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory\nappear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he\nhad seen and understood, that he could not answer him.\n\nEverything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the\nstern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,\nsuffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into\nNapoleon\'s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of\ngreatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and\nthe still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one\nalive could understand or explain.\n\nThe Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to\none of the officers as he went: \"Have these gentlemen attended to\nand taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their\nwounds. Au revoir, Prince Repnin!\" and he spurred his horse and\ngalloped away.\n\nHis face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.\n\nThe soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the\nlittle gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother\'s neck,\nbut seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now\nhastened to return the holy image.\n\nPrince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the\nlittle icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his\nchest outside his uniform.\n\n\"It would be good,\" thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his\nsister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, \"it\nwould be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to\nMary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,\nand what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I\nshould be if I could now say: \'Lord, have mercy on me!\'... But to whom\nshould I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,\nwhich I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in\nwords--the Great All or Nothing-\" said he to himself, \"or to that God\nwho has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain,\nnothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and\nthe greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.\"\n\nThe stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable\npain; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his\nfather, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt\nthe night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little\nNapoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief\nsubjects of his delirious fancies.\n\nThe quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented\nitself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that little\nNapoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of\nshortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and\ntorments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward\nmorning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness\nof unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon\'s\ndoctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in\nconvalescence.\n\n\"He is a nervous, bilious subject,\" said Larrey, \"and will not\nrecover.\"\n\nAnd Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care\nof the inhabitants of the district.');

Meeting a\ncomrade at the last post station but one before Moscow, Denisov had\ndrunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts\nacross the snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to\nMoscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostov, who grew\nmore and more impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.\n\n\"How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,\nshops, bakers\' signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!\" thought Rostov,\nwhen their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had\nentered Moscow.\n\n\"Denisov! We\'re here! He\'s asleep,\" he added, leaning forward with\nhis whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed\nof the sleigh.\n\nDenisov gave no answer.\n\n\"There\'s the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakhar, has\nhis stand, and there\'s Zakhar himself and still the same horse! And\nhere\'s the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can\'t you\nhurry up? Now then!\"\n\n\"Which house is it?\" asked the driver.\n\n\"Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don\'t you see? That\'s\nour house,\" said Rostov. \"Of course, it\'s our house! Denisov, Denisov!\nWe\'re almost there!\"\n\nDenisov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.\n\n\"Dmitri,\" said Rostov to his valet on the box, \"those lights are\nin our house, aren\'t they?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and there\'s a light in your father\'s study.\"\n\n\"Then they\'ve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,\ndon\'t forget to put out my new coat,\" added Rostov, fingering his\nnew mustache. \"Now then, get on,\" he shouted to the driver. \"Do wake\nup, Vaska!\" he went on, turning to Denisov, whose head was again\nnodding. \"Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodka--get\non!\" Rostov shouted, when the sleigh was only three houses from his\ndoor. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all. At last\nthe sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostov saw\noverhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off,\nthe porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He sprang out\nbefore the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house stood cold\nand silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it. There was no\none in the hall. \"Oh God! Is everyone all right?\" he thought, stopping\nfor a moment with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to\nrun along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar\nstaircase. The well-known old door handle, which always angered the\ncountess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely as\never. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.\n\nOld Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokofy, the footman, who was\nso strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat\nplaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the\nopening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly\nchanged to one of delighted amazement.\n\n\"Gracious heavens! The young count!\" he cried, recognizing his young\nmaster. \"Can it be? My treasure!\" and Prokofy, trembling with\nexcitement, rushed toward the drawing-room door, probably in order\nto announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss\nthe young man\'s shoulder.\n\n\"All well?\" asked Rostov, drawing away his arm.\n\n\"Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They\'ve just finished supper. Let me have\na look at you, your excellency.\"\n\n\"Is everything quite all right?\"\n\n\"The Lord be thanked, yes!\"\n\nRostov, who had completely forgotten Denisov, not wishing anyone\nto forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the\nlarge dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card\ntables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had\nalready seen the young master, and, before he had reached the\ndrawing room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and\nbegan hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the\nsame kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more\nkissing, more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish\nwhich was Papa, which Natasha, and which Petya. Everyone shouted,\ntalked, and kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not\nthere, he noticed that.\n\n\"And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...\"\n\n\"Here he is... our own... Kolya,* dear fellow... How he has\nchanged!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...\"\n\n\n*Nicholas.\n\n\n\"And me, kiss me!\"\n\n\"Dearest... and me!\"\n\nSonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhaylovna, Vera, and the old count\nwere all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the\nroom, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.\n\nPetya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, \"And me too!\"\n\nNatasha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his\nface with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang\naway and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked\npiercingly.\n\nAll around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all\naround were lips seeking a kiss.\n\nSonya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,\nlooked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she\nlonged. Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at\nthis moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not\ntaking her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave\nher a grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for\nsomeone. The old countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard\nat the door, steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother\'s.\n\nYet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made\nsince he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her.\nWhen they met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her\nface, but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar\'s jacket.\nDenisov, who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there\nand wiped his eyes at the sight.\n\n\"Vasili Denisov, your son\'s friend,\" he said, introducing himself to\nthe count, who was looking inquiringly at him.\n\n\"You are most welcome! I know, I know,\" said the count, kissing\nand embracing Denisov. \"Nicholas wrote us... Natasha, Vera, look! Here\nis Denisov!\"\n\nThe same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of\nDenisov.\n\n\"Darling Denisov!\" screamed Natasha, beside herself with rapture,\nspringing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This\nescapade made everybody feel confused. Denisov blushed too, but smiled\nand, taking Natasha\'s hand, kissed it.\n\nDenisov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostovs\nall gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.\n\nThe old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every\nmoment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every\nmovement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully\nadoring eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places\nnearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him\nhis tea, handkerchief, and pipe.\n\nRostov was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first\nmoment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed\ninsufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.\n\nNext morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers\nslept till ten o\'clock.\n\nIn the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,\nsatchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly\ncleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The\nservants were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving,\nand their well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell\nof tobacco.\n\n\"Hallo, Gwiska--my pipe!\" came Vasili Denisov\'s husky voice.\n\"Wostov, get up!\"\n\nRostov, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his\ndisheveled head from the hot pillow.\n\n\"Why, is it late?\"\n\n\"Late! It\'s nearly ten o\'clock,\" answered Natasha\'s voice. A\nrustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of\ngirls\' voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a\ncrack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black\nhair, and merry faces. It was Natasha, Sonya, and Petya, who had\ncome to see whether they were getting up.\n\n\"Nicholas! Get up!\" Natasha\'s voice was again heard at the door.\n\n\"Directly!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Petya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer\nroom, with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder\nbrother, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see\nmen undressed, opened the bedroom door.\n\n\"Is this your saber?\" he shouted.\n\nThe girls sprang aside. Denisov hid his hairy legs under the\nblanket, looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door,\nhaving let Petya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from\nbehind it.\n\n\"Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!\" said Natasha\'s voice.\n\n\"Is this your saber?\" asked Petya. \"Or is it yours?\" he said,\naddressing the black-mustached Denisov with servile deference.\n\nRostov hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing\ngown, and went out. Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just\ngetting her foot into the other. Sonya, when he came in, was\ntwirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon\nand sit down. They were dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and\nwere both fresh, rosy, and bright. Sonya ran away, but Natasha, taking\nher brother\'s arm, led him into the sitting room, where they began\ntalking. They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give\nreplies concerning a thousand little matters which could not\ninterest anyone but themselves. Natasha laughed at every word he\nsaid or that she said herself, not because what they were saying was\namusing, but because she felt happy and was unable to control her\njoy which expressed itself by laughter.\n\n\"Oh, how nice, how splendid!\" she said to everything.\n\nRostov felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that\nchildlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he\nleft home now for the first time after eighteen months again\nbrightened his soul and his face.\n\n\"No, but listen,\" she said, \"now you are quite a man, aren\'t you?\nI\'m awfully glad you\'re my brother.\" She touched his mustache. \"I want\nto know what you men are like. Are you the same as we? No?\"\n\n\"Why did Sonya run away?\" asked Rostov.\n\n\"Ah, yes! That\'s a whole long story! How are you going to speak to\nher--thou or you?\"\n\n\"As may happen,\" said Rostov.\n\n\"No, call her you, please! I\'ll tell you all about it some other\ntime. No, I\'ll tell you now. You know Sonya\'s my dearest friend.\nSuch a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!\"\n\nShe pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her\nlong, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is\ncovered even by a ball dress.\n\n\"I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in\nthe fire and pressed it there!\"\n\nSitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what\nused to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natasha\'s wildly\nbright eyes, Rostov re-entered that world of home and childhood\nwhich had no meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best\njoys of his life; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of\nlove did not seem to him senseless, he understood and was not\nsurprised at it.\n\n\"Well, and is that all?\" he asked.\n\n\"We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just\nnonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does\nit for life, but I don\'t understand that, I forget quickly.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\n\"Well, she loves me and you like that.\"\n\nNatasha suddenly flushed.\n\n\"Why, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are\nto forget all that.... She says: \'I shall love him always, but let him\nbe free.\' Isn\'t that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn\'t it?\"\nasked Natasha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that\nwhat she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.\n\nRostov became thoughtful.\n\n\"I never go back on my word,\" he said. \"Besides, Sonya is so\ncharming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Natasha, \"she and I have already talked it over.\nWe knew you\'d say so. But it won\'t do, because you see, if you say\nthat--if you consider yourself bound by your promise--it will seem\nas if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were\nmarrying her because you must, and that wouldn\'t do at all.\"\n\nRostov saw that it had been well considered by them. Sonya had\nalready struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when\nhe had caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She\nwas a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with\nhim (he did not doubt that for an instant). Why should he not love her\nnow, and even marry her, Rostov thought, but just now there were so\nmany other pleasures and interests before him! \"Yes, they have taken a\nwise decision,\" he thought, \"I must remain free.\"\n\n\"Well then, that\'s excellent,\" said he. \"We\'ll talk it over later\non. Oh, how glad I am to have you!\"\n\n\"Well, and are you still true to Boris?\" he continued.\n\n\"Oh, what nonsense!\" cried Natasha, laughing. \"I don\'t think about\nhim or anyone else, and I don\'t want anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Dear me! Then what are you up to now?\"\n\n\"Now?\" repeated Natasha, and a happy smile lit up her face. \"Have\nyou seen Duport?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not seen Duport--the famous dancer? Well then, you won\'t\nunderstand. That\'s what I\'m up to.\"\n\nCurving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran\nback a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply\ntogether, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.\n\n\"See, I\'m standing! See!\" she said, but could not maintain herself\non her toes any longer. \"So that\'s what I\'m up to! I\'ll never marry\nanyone, but will be a dancer. Only don\'t tell anyone.\"\n\nRostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov, in his bedroom,\nfelt envious and Natasha could not help joining in.\n\n\"No, but don\'t you think it\'s nice?\" she kept repeating.\n\n\"Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Boris?\"\n\nNatasha flared up. \"I don\'t want to marry anyone. And I\'ll tell\nhim so when I see him!\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Rostov.\n\n\"But that\'s all rubbish,\" Natasha chattered on. \"And is Denisov\nnice?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\"\n\n\"Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible,\nDenisov?\"\n\n\"Why terrible?\" asked Nicholas. \"No, Vaska is a splendid fellow.\"\n\n\"You call him Vaska? That\'s funny! And is he very nice?\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"Well then, be quick. We\'ll all have breakfast together.\"\n\nAnd Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet\ndancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When\nRostov met Sonya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know how\nto behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of\nmeeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not\nbe done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was\nlooking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave\nwith her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as\nyou--Sonya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender\nkisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by\nNatasha\'s intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then thanked\nhim for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom\nand told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her,\nfor that would be impossible.\n\n\"How strange it is,\" said Vera, selecting a moment when all were\nsilent, \"that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet\nlike strangers.\"\n\nVera\'s remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most\nof her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only\nSonya, Nicholas, and Natasha, but even the old countess, who--dreading\nthis love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant\nmatch--blushed like a girl.\n\nDenisov, to Rostov\'s surprise, appeared in the drawing room with\npomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as\nhe made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the\nladies and gentlemen than Rostov had ever expected to see him.');

The old count had money enough\nthat year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,\nacquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the\nlatest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the\nlatest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,\npassed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself\nto the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be\nat home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His\ndespair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money\nfrom Gavril to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing Sonya on the sly--he\nnow recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.\nNow he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and\nwearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in\naction, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected\nracing men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a\nlady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led\nthe mazurka at the Arkharovs\' ball, talked about the war with Field\nMarshal Kamenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate\nterms with a colonel of forty to whom Denisov had introduced him.\n\nHis passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But\nstill, as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him,\nhe often spoke about him and about his love for him, letting it be\nunderstood that he had not told all and that there was something in\nhis feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand, and with\nhis whole soul he shared the adoration then common in Moscow for the\nEmperor, who was spoken of as the \"angel incarnate.\"\n\nDuring Rostov\'s short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army,\nhe did not draw closer to Sonya, but rather drifted away from her. She\nwas very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him,\nbut he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do\nthat there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears\nto bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many\nother things. When he thought of Sonya, during this stay in Moscow, he\nsaid to himself, \"Ah, there will be, and there are, many more such\ngirls somewhere whom I do not yet know. There will be time enough to\nthink about love when I want to, but now I have no time.\" Besides,\nit seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to\nhis manhood. He went to balls and into ladies\' society with an\naffectation of doing so against his will. The races, the English Club,\nsprees with Denisov, and visits to a certain house--that was another\nmatter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!\n\nAt the beginning of March, old Count Ilya Rostov was very busy\narranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club.\n\nThe count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving\norders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist, the Club\'s head\ncook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish\nfor this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee of\nthe Club from the day it was founded. To him the Club entrusted the\narrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration, for few men knew so\nwell how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and\nstill fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of\ntheir own resources what might be needed for the success of the\nfete. The club cook and the steward listened to the count\'s orders\nwith pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could\nthey so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner\ncosting several thousand rubles.\n\n\"Well then, mind and have cocks\' comb in the turtle soup, you know!\"\n\n\"Shall we have three cold dishes then?\" asked the cook.\n\nThe count considered.\n\n\"We can\'t have less--yes, three... the mayonnaise, that\'s one,\" said\nhe, bending down a finger.\n\n\"Then am I to order those large sterlets?\" asked the steward.\n\n\"Yes, it can\'t be helped if they won\'t take less. Ah, dear me! I was\nforgetting. We must have another entree. Ah, goodness gracious!\" he\nclutched at his head. \"Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmitri! Eh,\nDmitri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,\" he said to the factotum\nwho appeared at his call. \"Hurry off and tell Maksim, the gardener, to\nset the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must\nbe brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred\npots here on Friday.\"\n\nHaving given several more orders, he was about to go to his\n\"little countess\" to have a rest, but remembering something else of\nimportance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club\nsteward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the\nclinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count,\nhandsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made\nsleeker by his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.\n\n\"Ah, my boy, my head\'s in a whirl!\" said the old man with a smile,\nas if he felt a little confused before his son. \"Now, if you would\nonly help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own\norchestra, but shouldn\'t we get the gypsy singers as well? You\nmilitary men like that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagration worried himself less\nbefore the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now,\" said his son with\na smile.\n\nThe old count pretended to be angry.\n\n\"Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!\"\n\nAnd the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and\nrespectful expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the\nfather and son.\n\n\"What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktist?\" said\nhe. \"Laughing at us old fellows!\"\n\n\"That\'s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good\ndinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that\'s not their\nbusiness!\"\n\n\"That\'s it, that\'s it!\" exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his\nson by both hands, he cried, \"Now I\'ve got you, so take the sleigh and\npair at once, and go to Bezukhov\'s, and tell him \'Count Ilya has\nsent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.\' We can\'t get\nthem from anyone else. He\'s not there himself, so you\'ll have to go in\nand ask the princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay--the\ncoachman Ipatka knows--and look up the gypsy Ilyushka, the one who\ndanced at Count Orlov\'s, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and\nbring him along to me.\"\n\n\"And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?\" asked\nNicholas, laughing. \"Dear, dear!...\"\n\nAt that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the\nbusinesslike, preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never\nleft her face, Anna Mikhaylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon\nthe count in his dressing gown every day, he invariably became\nconfused and begged her to excuse his costume.\n\n\"No matter at all, my dear count,\" she said, meekly closing her\neyes. \"But I\'ll go to Bezukhov\'s myself. Pierre has arrived, and now\nwe shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him in\nany case. He has forwarded me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris is\nnow on the staff.\"\n\nThe count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna\'s taking upon herself\none of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.\n\n\"Tell Bezukhov to come. I\'ll put his name down. Is his wife with\nhim?\" he asked.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was\ndepicted on her face.\n\n\"Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,\" she said. \"If what\nwe hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing\nwhen we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul\nas young Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to\ngive him what consolation I can.\"\n\n\"Wh-what is the matter?\" asked both the young and old Rostov.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna sighed deeply.\n\n\"Dolokhov, Mary Ivanovna\'s son,\" she said in a mysterious whisper,\n\"has compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, invited\nhim to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and\nthat daredevil after her!\" said Anna Mikhaylovna, wishing to show\nher sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half\nsmile betraying her sympathy for the \"daredevil,\" as she called\nDolokhov. \"They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the Club--it will all\nblow over. It will be a tremendous banquet.\"\n\nNext day, the third of March, soon after one o\'clock, two hundred\nand fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting\nthe guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince\nBagration, to dinner.\n\nOn the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow\nhad been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to\nvictories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not\nbelieve it, while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so\nstrange an event. In the English Club, where all who were\ndistinguished, important, and well informed foregathered when the\nnews began to arrive in December, nothing was said about the war and\nthe last battle, as though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The\nmen who set the tone in conversation--Count Rostopchin, Prince Yuri\nDolgorukov, Valuev, Count Markov, and Prince Vyazemski--did not show\nthemselves at the Club, but met in private houses in intimate circles,\nand the Moscovites who took their opinions from others--Ilya Rostov\namong them--remained for a while without any definite opinion on the\nsubject of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that\nsomething was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult,\nand so it was best to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury\ncomes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the Club\'s opinion\nreappeared, and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely.\nReasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and impossible\nevent of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all corners\nof Moscow the same things began to be said. These reasons were the\ntreachery of the Austrians, a defective commissariat, the treachery of\nthe Pole Przebyszewski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kutuzov\'s\nincapacity, and (it was whispered) the youth and inexperience of the\nsovereign, who had trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the\narmy, the Russian army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had\nachieved miracles of valor. The soldiers, officers, and generals were\nheroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagration, distinguished\nby his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz,\nwhere he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day\nbeaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also\nconduced to Bagration\'s being selected as Moscow\'s hero was the fact\nthat he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there. In\nhis person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier\nwithout connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by\nmemories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov. Moreover,\npaying such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing\ndisapproval and dislike of Kutuzov.\n\n\"Had there been no Bagration, it would have been necessary to invent\nhim,\" said the wit Shinshin, parodying the words of Voltaire.\nKutuzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,\ncalling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.\n\nAll Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukov\'s saying: \"If you go on\nmodeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,\" suggesting\nconsolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and\nthe words of Rostopchin, that French soldiers have to be incited to\nbattle by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to\nshow them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but\nthat Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all\nsides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of\nheroism shown by our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a\nstandard, another had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five\ncannon singlehanded. Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know\nhim, as having, when wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the\nleft, and gone forward. Of Bolkonski, nothing was said, and only those\nwho knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a\npregnant wife with his eccentric father.');

The members and guests of the Club wandered hither and\nthither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in\nevening dress, and a few here and there with powdered hair and in\nRussian kaftans. Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and\nsmart stockings, stood at every door anxiously noting visitors\'\nevery movement in order to offer their services. Most of those present\nwere elderly, respected men with broad, self-confident faces, fat\nfingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of guests and\nmembers sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual\ngroups. A minority of those present were casual guests--chiefly\nyoung men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov, and Dolokhov--who was\nnow again an officer in the Semenov regiment. The faces of these young\npeople, especially those who were military men, bore that expression of\ncondescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older\ngeneration, \"We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the\nsame remember that the future belongs to us.\"\n\nNesvitski was there as an old member of the Club. Pierre, who at his\nwife\'s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,\nwent about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull.\nHere, as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience\nto his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people,\nhe treated them with absent-minded contempt.\n\nBy his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his\nwealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored\nguests, and so he went from one group to another. Some of the most\nimportant old men were the center of groups which even strangers\napproached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men. The\nlargest circles formed round Count Rostopchin, Valuev, and\nNaryshkin. Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had been\noverwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through\nthem with bayonets.\n\nValuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from\nPetersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.\n\nIn the third circle, Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the\nAustrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a cock in reply\nto the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinshin, standing\nclose by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had evidently\nfailed to learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of\ncrowing like a cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the\nwit, making him feel that in that place and on that day, it was\nimproper to speak so of Kutuzov.\n\nCount Ilya Rostov, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft\nboots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the\nimportant and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all\nequals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up\nyoung son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostov\nstood at a window with Dolokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made\nand highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed\nDolokhov\'s hand.\n\n\"Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been\ntogether out there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasili\nIgnatovich... How d\'ye do, old fellow?\" he said, turning to an old man\nwho was passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a\ngeneral stir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a\nfrightened face: \"He\'s arrived!\"\n\nBells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and--like rye shaken\ntogether in a shovel--the guests who had been scattered about in\ndifferent rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by\nthe door of the ballroom.\n\nBagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or\nsword, which, in accord with the Club custom, he had given up to the\nhall porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded\nwhip over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of\nthe battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian\nand foreign Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast.\nEvidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and\nwhiskers trimmed, which changed his appearance for the worse. There\nwas something naively festive in his air, which, in conjunction with\nhis firm and virile features, gave him a rather comical expression.\nBekleshev and Theodore Uvarov, who had arrived with him, paused at the\ndoorway to allow him, as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagration\nwas embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and\nthis caused some delay at the doors, but after all he did at last\nenter first. He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of\nthe reception room, not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more\naccustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had done at\nthe head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabern--and he would have\nfound that easier. The committeemen met him at the first door and,\nexpressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest, took\npossession of him as it were, without waiting for his reply,\nsurrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was at first\nimpossible to enter the drawing-room door for the crowd of members and\nguests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagration\nover each other\'s shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count\nIlya Rostov, laughing and repeating the words, \"Make way, dear boy!\nMake way, make way!\" pushed through the crowd more energetically\nthan anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and seated them\non the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the\nClub, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting his way\nthrough the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a\nminute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver\nwhich he presented to Prince Bagration. On the salver lay some\nverses composed and printed in the hero\'s honor. Bagration, on\nseeing the salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help.\nBut all eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in\ntheir power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and\nlooked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it\nto him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration (or he\nwould, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner\nwith it) and drew his attention to the verses.\n\n\"Well, I will read them, then!\" Bagration seemed to say, and, fixing\nhis weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and\nserious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began\nreading them aloud. Bagration bowed his head and listened:\n\n   Bring glory then to Alexander\'s reign\n   And on the throne our Titus shield.\n   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,\n   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!\n   E\'en fortunate Napoleon\n   Knows by experience, now, Bagration,\n   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...\n\nBut before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo\nannounced that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the\ndining room came the resounding strains of the polonaise:\n\n   Conquest\'s joyful thunder waken,\n   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...\n\nand Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading\nhis verses, bowed to Bagration. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was\nmore important than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the\nrest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between\ntwo Alexanders--Bekleshev and Naryshkin--which was a significant\nallusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took\ntheir seats in the dining room, according to their rank and\nimportance: the more important nearer to the honored guest, as\nnaturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest.\n\nJust before dinner, Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to\nBagration, who recognized him and said a few words to him,\ndisjointed and awkward, as were all the words he spoke that day, and\nCount Ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagration spoke to\nhis son.\n\nNicholas Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov,\nsat almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre,\nbeside Prince Nesvitski. Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of\nthe committee sat facing Bagration and, as the very personification of\nMoscow hospitality, did the honors to the prince.\n\nHis efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and\nthe other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till\nthe end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions\nto the footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety.\nEverything was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet\n(at sight of which Ilya Rostov blushed with self-conscious\npleasure), the footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne\nglasses. After the fish, which made a certain sensation, the count\nexchanged glances with the other committeemen. \"There will be many\ntoasts, it\'s time to begin,\" he whispered, and taking up his glass, he\nrose. All were silent, waiting for what he would say.\n\n\"To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!\" he cried, and at\nthe same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and\nenthusiasm. The band immediately struck up \"Conquest\'s joyful\nthunder waken...\" All rose and cried \"Hurrah!\" Bagration also rose and\nshouted \"Hurrah!\" in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it\non the field at Schon Grabern. Young Rostov\'s ecstatic voice could\nbe heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. \"To the\nhealth of our Sovereign, the Emperor!\" he roared, \"Hurrah!\" and\nemptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many\nfollowed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time.\nWhen the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass\nand everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and\nexchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note\nlying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, \"To the health of the\nhero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivanovich Bagration!\" and\nagain his blue eyes grew moist. \"Hurrah!\" cried the three hundred\nvoices again, but instead of the band a choir began singing a\ncantata composed by Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov:\n\n   Russians! O\'er all barriers on!\n   Courage conquest guarantees;\n   Have we not Bagration?\n   He brings foe men to their knees,... etc.\n\n\nAs soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was\nproposed and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved, more\nglass was smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to\nBekleshev, Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, to the\ncommittee, to all the Club members and to all the Club guests, and\nfinally to Count Ilya Rostov separately, as the organizer of the\nbanquet. At that toast, the count took out his handkerchief and,\ncovering his face, wept outright.');

As usual, he ate\nand drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed\nthat some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all\nthrough dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed\neyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge\nof his nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and\nhear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by\nsome depressing and unsolved problem.\n\nThe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by\nthe princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dolokhov\'s intimacy\nwith his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that\nmorning, which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters\nsaid that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that his wife\'s\nconnection with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre\nabsolutely disbelieved both the princess\' hints and the letter, but he\nfeared now to look at Dolokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every\ntime he chanced to meet Dolokhov\'s handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt\nsomething terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly\naway. Involuntarily recalling his wife\'s past and her relations with\nDolokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be\ntrue, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his\nwife. He involuntarily remembered how Dolokhov, who had fully\nrecovered his former position after the campaign, had returned to\nPetersburg and come to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations\nwith Pierre as a boon companion, Dolokhov had come straight to his\nhouse, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled\nhow Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov\'s living at\ntheir house, and how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife\'s\nbeauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left\nthem for a day.\n\n\"Yes, he is very handsome,\" thought Pierre, \"and I know him. It\nwould be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule\nme, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended\nhim, and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add\nto the pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it\nwere true, but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can\'t,\nbelieve it.\" He remembered the expression Dolokhov\'s face assumed in\nhis moments of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and\ndropping them into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel\nwithout any reason, or shot a post-boy\'s horse with a pistol. That\nexpression was often on Dolokhov\'s face when looking at him. \"Yes,\nhe is a bully,\" thought Pierre, \"to kill a man means nothing to him.\nIt must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must\nplease him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him--and in fact I\nam afraid of him,\" he thought, and again he felt something terrible\nand monstrous rising in his soul. Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov were\nnow sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostov was talking\nmerrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the\nother a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he\nglanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and\nmassive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rostov\nlooked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his\nhussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a\nword--an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation\nand absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had not\nresponded to his greeting. When the Emperor\'s health was drunk,\nPierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.\n\n\"What are you about?\" shouted Rostov, looking at him in an ecstasy\nof exasperation. \"Don\'t you hear it\'s His Majesty the Emperor\'s\nhealth?\"\n\nPierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting\ntill all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostov.\n\n\"Why, I didn\'t recognize you!\" he said. But Rostov was otherwise\nengaged; he was shouting \"Hurrah!\"\n\n\"Why don\'t you renew the acquaintance?\" said Dolokhov to Rostov.\n\n\"Confound him, he\'s a fool!\" said Rostov.\n\n\"One should make up to the husbands of pretty women,\" said Denisov.\n\nPierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were\ntalking about him. He reddened and turned away.\n\n\"Well, now to the health of handsome women!\" said Dolokhov, and with\na serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his\nmouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.\n\n\"Here\'s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin--and their\nlovers!\" he added.\n\nPierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking\nat Dolokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing\nleaflets with Kutuzov\'s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of\nthe principal guests. He was just going to take it when Dolokhov,\nleaning across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre\nlooked at Dolokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and\nmonstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took\npossession of him. He leaned his whole massive body across the table.\n\n\"How dare you take it?\" he shouted.\n\nHearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvitski\nand the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov.\n\n\"Don\'t! Don\'t! What are you about?\" whispered their frightened\nvoices.\n\nDolokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that\nsmile of his which seemed to say, \"Ah! This is what I like!\"\n\n\"You shan\'t have it!\" he said distinctly.\n\nPale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.\n\n\"You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!\" he ejaculated, and,\npushing back his chair, he rose from the table.\n\nAt the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt\nthat the question of his wife\'s guilt which had been tormenting him\nthe whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative.\nHe hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Denisov\'s\nrequest that he would take no part in the matter, Rostov agreed to\nbe Dolokhov\'s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements\nfor the duel with Nesvitski, Bezukhov\'s second. Pierre went home,\nbut Rostov with Dolokhov and Denisov stayed on at the Club till\nlate, listening to the gypsies and other singers.\n\n\"Well then, till tomorrow at Sokolniki,\" said Dolokhov, as he took\nleave of Rostov in the Club porch.\n\n\"And do you feel quite calm?\" Rostov asked.\n\nDolokhov paused.\n\n\"Well, you see, I\'ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two\nwords. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write\naffectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be\nkilled, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the\nfirm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as\npossible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostroma\nused to tell me. \'Everyone fears a bear,\' he says, \'but when you see\none your fear\'s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him\nget away!\' And that\'s how it is with me. A demain, mon cher.\"*\n\n\n*Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.\n\n\nNext day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitski drove to the\nSokolniki forest and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov already\nthere. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations\nwhich had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face\nwas yellow. He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about\ndistractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He\nwas entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wife\'s guilt, of\nwhich after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, and\nthe guiltlessness of Dolokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor\nof a man who was nothing to him.... \"I should perhaps have done the\nsame thing in his place,\" thought Pierre. \"It\'s even certain that I\nshould have done the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I\nshall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee.\nCan\'t I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?\" passed\nthrough his mind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to\nhim, he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way,\nwhich inspired the respect of the onlookers, \"Will it be long? Are\nthings ready?\"\n\nWhen all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the\nbarriers, and the pistols loaded, Nesvitski went up to Pierre.\n\n\"I should not be doing my duty, Count,\" he said in timid tones, \"and\nshould not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in\nchoosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment\nI did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient\nground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were\nnot right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...\"\n\n\"Oh yes, it is horribly stupid,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your\nopponent will accept them,\" said Nesvitski (who like the others\nconcerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not\nyet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel). \"You know,\nCount, it is much more honorable to admit one\'s mistake than to let\nmatters become irreparable. There was no insult on either side.\nAllow me to convey....\"\n\n\"No! What is there to talk about?\" said Pierre. \"It\'s all the\nsame.... Is everything ready?\" he added. \"Only tell me where to go and\nwhere to shoot,\" he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.\n\nHe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of\nthe trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand--a fact\nthat he did not wish to confess.\n\n\"Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,\" said he.\n\n\"No apologies, none whatever,\" said Dolokhov to Denisov (who on\nhis side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to\nthe appointed place.\n\nThe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,\nwhere the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine\nforest covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up\nduring the last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at\nthe farther edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces,\nleft tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been\nstanding and Nesvitski\'s and Dolokhov\'s sabers, which were stuck\ninto the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and\nmisty; at forty paces\' distance nothing could be seen. For three\nminutes all had been ready, but they still delayed and all were\nsilent.');

A feeling\nof dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly\nbegun could no longer be averted but was taking its course\nindependently of men\'s will.\n\nDenisov first went to the barrier and announced: \"As the adve\'sawies\nhave wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your pistols,\nand at the word thwee begin to advance.\n\n\"O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!\" he shouted angrily and stepped aside.\n\nThe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and\nnearer to one another, beginning to see one another through the\nmist. They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached\nthe barrier. Dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol,\nlooking intently with his bright, sparkling blue eyes into his\nantagonist\'s face. His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile.\n\n\"So I can fire when I like!\" said Pierre, and at the word \"three,\"\nhe went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into\nthe deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at arm\'s length,\napparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left hand he held\ncarefully back, because he wished to support his right hand with it\nand knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and strayed\noff the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, then\nquickly glanced at Dolokhov and, bending his finger as he had been\nshown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre\nshuddered at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations,\nstood still. The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him\nfrom seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second report as\nhe had expected. He only heard Dolokhov\'s hurried steps, and his\nfigure came in view through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his\nleft side, while the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face\nwas pale. Rostov ran toward him and said something.\n\n\"No-o-o!\" muttered Dolokhov through his teeth, \"no, it\'s not\nover.\" And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the\nsaber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he\nwiped it on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning\nface was pallid and quivered.\n\n\"Plea...\" began Dolokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.\n\n\"Please,\" he uttered with an effort.\n\nPierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dolokhov\nand was about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dolokhov\ncried:\n\n\"To your barrier!\" and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by\nhis saber. Only ten paces divided them. Dolokhov lowered his head to\nthe snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself,\ndrew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He\nsucked and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but\nhis eyes, still smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as\nhe mustered his remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.\n\n\"Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!\" ejaculated Nesvitski.\n\n\"Cover yourself!\" even Denisov cried to his adversary.\n\nPierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs\nhelplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing\nDolokhov looked sorrowfully at him. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitski\nclosed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report and\nDolokhov\'s angry cry.\n\n\"Missed!\" shouted Dolokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on\nthe snow.\n\nPierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,\ntrampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:\n\n\"Folly... folly! Death... lies...\" he repeated, puckering his face.\n\nNesvitski stopped him and took him home.\n\nRostov and Denisov drove away with the wounded Dolokhov.\n\nThe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not\nanswer a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering\nMoscow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort,\ntook Rostov, who was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostov was\nstruck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender\nexpression on Dolokhov\'s face.\n\n\"Well? How do you feel?\" he asked.\n\n\"Bad! But it\'s not that, my friend-\" said Dolokhov with a gasping\nvoice. \"Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don\'t matter, but I have\nkilled her, killed... She won\'t get over it! She won\'t survive....\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Rostov.\n\n\"My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,\" and\nDolokhov pressed Rostov\'s hand and burst into tears.\n\nWhen he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostov that\nhe was living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not\nsurvive it. He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her.\n\nRostov went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise\nlearned that Dolokhov the brawler, Dolokhov the bully, lived in Moscow\nwith an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most\naffectionate of sons and brothers.');

Both in Petersburg\nand in Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after\nthe duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained\nin his father\'s room, that huge room in which Count Bezukhov had died.\n\nHe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that\nhad happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,\nthoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not\nfall asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace\nthe room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early\ndays of their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid,\npassionate look on her face, and then immediately he saw beside her\nDolokhov\'s handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen\nit at the banquet, and then that same face pale, quivering, and\nsuffering, as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he asked himself. \"I have killed her lover,\nyes, killed my wife\'s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come\nto do it?\"--\"Because you married her,\" answered an inner voice.\n\n\"But in what was I to blame?\" he asked. \"In marrying her without\nloving her; in deceiving yourself and her.\" And he vividly recalled\nthat moment after supper at Prince Vasili\'s, when he spoke those words\nhe had found so difficult to utter: \"I love you.\" \"It all comes from\nthat! Even then I felt it,\" he thought. \"I felt then that it was not\nso, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.\"\n\nHe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.\nParticularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection\nof how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into\nhis study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his\nhead steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and\nat his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing\nrespectful understanding of his employer\'s happiness.\n\n\"But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic\nbeauty and social tact,\" thought he; \"been proud of my house, in\nwhich she received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and\nbeauty. So this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did\nnot understand her. How often when considering her character I have\ntold myself that I was to blame for not understanding her, for not\nunderstanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of\nall interests or desires, and the whole secret lies in the terrible\ntruth that she is a depraved woman. Now I have spoken that terrible\nword to myself all has become clear.\n\n\"Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her\nnaked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be\nkissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied\nwith a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: \'Let him\ndo what he pleases,\' she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she\nfelt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she\nwas not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to\nhave any children by me.\"\n\nThen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and\nthe vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though\nshe had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.\n\n\"I\'m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous\npromener,\"* she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with\nyoung and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not\nlove her.\n\n\n*\"You clear out of this.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, I never loved her,\" said he to himself; \"I knew she was a\ndepraved woman,\" he repeated, \"but dared not admit it to myself. And\nnow there\'s Dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and\nperhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!\"\n\nPierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of\nwhat is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their\ntroubles. He digested his sufferings alone.\n\n\"It is all, all her fault,\" he said to himself; \"but what of that?\nWhy did I bind myself to her? Why did I say \'Je vous aime\'* to her,\nwhich was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must\nendure... what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that\'s\nnonsense,\" he thought. \"The slur on my name and honor--that\'s all\napart from myself.\n\n\n*I love you.\n\n\n\"Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a\ncriminal,\" came into Pierre\'s head, \"and from their point of view they\nwere right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr\'s\ndeath for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot.\nWho is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive--live:\ntomorrow you\'ll die as I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth\ntormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison\nwith eternity?\"\n\nBut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such\nreflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments\nwhen he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he\nfelt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move\nabout and break and tear whatever came to his hand. \"Why did I tell\nher that \'Je vous aime\'?\" he kept repeating to himself. And when he\nhad said it for the tenth time, Molibre\'s words: \"Mais que diable\nalloit-il faire dans cette galere?\" occurred to him, and he began to\nlaugh at himself.\n\nIn the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to\nPetersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He\nresolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his\nintention to part from her forever.\n\nNext morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee,\nPierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.\n\nHe woke up and looked round for a while with a startled\nexpression, unable to realize where he was.\n\n\"The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at\nhome,\" said the valet.\n\nBut before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the\ncountess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with\nsilver and with simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round\nher lovely head like a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic,\nexcept that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent\nmarble brow. With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in\nfront of the valet. She knew of the duel and had come to speak about\nit. She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and\nleft the room. Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles, and\nlike a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and\ncontinues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he tried to\ncontinue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and impossible,\nhe again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but looked at\nhim with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go.\n\n\"Well, what\'s this now? What have you been up to now, I should\nlike to know?\" she asked sternly.\n\n\"I? What have I...?\" stammered Pierre.\n\n\"So it seems you\'re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel\nabout? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.\"\n\nPierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth,\nbut could not reply.\n\n\"If you won\'t answer, I\'ll tell you...\" Helene went on. \"You believe\neverything you\'re told. You were told...\" Helene laughed, \"that\nDolokhov was my lover,\" she said in French with her coarse plainness\nof speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other word, \"and\nyou believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel\nprove? That you\'re a fool, que vous etes un sot, but everybody knew\nthat. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of\nall Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing\nwhat you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without\ncause.\" Helene raised her voice and became more and more excited, \"A\nman who\'s a better man than you in every way...\"\n\n\"Hm... Hm...!\" growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her,\nand not moving a muscle.\n\n\"And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like\nhis company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should\nprefer yours.\"\n\n\"Don\'t speak to me... I beg you,\" muttered Pierre hoarsely.\n\n\"Why shouldn\'t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you\nplainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who\nwould not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,\"\nsaid she.\n\nPierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose\nstrange expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He\nwas suffering physically at that moment, there was a weight on his\nchest and he could not breathe. He knew that he must do something to\nput an end to this suffering, but what he wanted to do was too\nterrible.\n\n\"We had better separate,\" he muttered in a broken voice.\n\n\"Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,\" said\nHelene. \"Separate! That\'s a thing to frighten me with!\"\n\nPierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.\n\n\"I\'ll kill you!\" he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table\nwith a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her\nbrandishing the slab.\n\nHelene\'s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His\nfather\'s nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and\ndelight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down\non her with outstretched hands shouted, \"Get out!\" in such a\nterrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows\nwhat he would have done at that moment had Helene not fled from the\nroom.\n\n\nA week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his\nestates in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property,\nand left for Petersburg alone.');

What\nwas worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a\npossibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the\npeople of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or\ndying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. The\ngazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at\nAusterlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after\nbrilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made\ntheir withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this\nofficial report that our army had been defeated. A week after the\ngazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from\nKutuzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.\n\n\"Your son,\" wrote Kutuzov, \"fell before my eyes, a standard in his\nhand and at the head of a regiment--he fell as a hero, worthy of his\nfather and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the\nwhole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort\nmyself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise\nhe would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field\nof battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.\"\n\nAfter receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone\nin his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next\nmorning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the\narchitect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.\n\nWhen Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at\nhis lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.\n\n\"Ah, Princess Mary!\" he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,\nthrowing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own\nimpetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that\nwheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)\n\nShe approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her.\nHer eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father\'s face, not sad,\nnot crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging\nover her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the\nworst in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and\nincomprehensible--the death of one she loved.\n\n\"Father! Andrew!\"--said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such\nan indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her\nfather could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.\n\n\"Bad news! He\'s not among the prisoners nor among the killed!\nKutuzov writes...\" and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to\ndrive the princess away by that scream... \"Killed!\"\n\nThe princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but\non hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in\nher beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy--a supreme joy apart\nfrom the joys and sorrows of this world--overflowed the great grief\nwithin her. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took\nhis hand, and drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy\nneck.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"do not turn away from me, let us weep together.\"\n\n\"Scoundrels! Blackguards!\" shrieked the old man, turning his face\naway from her. \"Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why?\nGo, go and tell Lise.\"\n\nThe princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father\nand wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he\ntook leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw\nhim tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. \"Did\nhe believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There\nin the realms of eternal peace and blessedness?\" she thought.\n\n\"Father, tell me how it happened,\" she asked through her tears.\n\n\"Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and\nRussia\'s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell\nLise. I will follow.\"\n\nWhen Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat\nworking and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy\ncalm peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did\nnot see Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at\nsomething joyful and mysterious taking place within her.\n\n\"Mary,\" she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying\nback, \"give me your hand.\" She took her sister-in-law\'s hand and\nheld it below her waist.\n\nHer eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained\nlifted in childlike happiness.\n\nPrincess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of\nher sister-in-law\'s dress.\n\n\"There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,\nMary, I am going to love him very much,\" said Lise, looking with\nbright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.\n\nPrincess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.\n\n\"What is the matter, Mary?\"\n\n\"Nothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\" she said, wiping\naway her tears on her sister-in-law\'s knee.\n\nSeveral times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began\ntrying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry.\nUnobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of\nwhich she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but\nlooked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner\nthe old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with\na peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without\nsaying a word. She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a\nwhile with that expression of attention to something within her that\nis only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry.\n\n\"Has anything come from Andrew?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, you know it\'s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I\nfeel afraid.\"\n\n\"So there\'s nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant\neyes at her sister-in-law.\n\nShe had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to\nhide the terrible news from her till after her confinement, which\nwas expected within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince\neach bore and hid their grief in their own way. The old prince would\nnot cherish any hope: he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had\nbeen killed, and though he sent an official to Austria to seek for\ntraces of his son, he ordered a monument from Moscow which he intended\nto erect in his own garden to his memory, and he told everybody that\nhis son had been killed. He tried not to change his former way of\nlife, but his strength failed him. He walked less, ate less, slept\nless, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary hoped. She prayed for\nher brother as living and was always awaiting news of his return.');

Oh, you are\nvery pale!\" said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,\nponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.\n\n\"Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdanovna be sent for?\" said\none of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogdanovna was a midwife\nfrom the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last\nfortnight.)\n\n\"Oh yes,\" assented Princess Mary, \"perhaps that\'s it. I\'ll go.\nCourage, my angel.\" She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on\nthe little princess\' face, an expression of childish fear of\ninevitable pain showed itself.\n\n\"No, it\'s only indigestion?... Say it\'s only indigestion, say so,\nMary! Say...\" And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a\nsuffering child and to wring her little hands even with some\naffectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary\nBogdanovna.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!\" she heard as she left the room.\n\nThe midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small,\nplump white hands with an air of calm importance.\n\n\"Mary Bogdanovna, I think it\'s beginning!\" said Princess Mary\nlooking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.\n\n\"Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess,\" said Mary Bogdanovna, not\nhastening her steps. \"You young ladies should not know anything\nabout it.\"\n\n\"But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?\" said the\nprincess. (In accordance with Lise\'s and Prince Andrew\'s wishes they\nhad sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at\nany moment.)\n\n\"No matter, Princess, don\'t be alarmed,\" said Mary Bogdanovna.\n\"We\'ll manage very well without a doctor.\"\n\nFive minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy\nbeing carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the\nlarge leather sofa from Prince Andrew\'s study into the bedroom. On\ntheir faces was a quiet and solemn look.\n\nPrincess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the\nhouse, now and then opening her door when someone passed and\nwatching what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with\nquiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and\nturned away. She did not venture to ask any questions, and shut the\ndoor again, now sitting down in her easy chair, now taking her\nprayer book, now kneeling before the icon stand. To her surprise and\ndistress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement.\nSuddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse, Praskovya Savishna,\nwho hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden\nit, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head.\n\n\"I\'ve come to sit with you a bit, Masha,\" said the nurse, \"and\nhere I\'ve brought the prince\'s wedding candles to light before his\nsaint, my angel,\" she said with a sigh.\n\n\"Oh, nurse, I\'m so glad!\"\n\n\"God is merciful, birdie.\"\n\nThe nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by\nthe door with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began\nreading. Only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one\nanother, the princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging.\nEveryone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that\nPrincess Mary experienced as she sat in her room. But owing to the\nsuperstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman\nin travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one\nspoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good\nmanners habitual in the prince\'s household, a common anxiety, a\nsoftening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and\nmysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt.\n\nThere was no laughter in the maids\' large hall. In the men servants\'\nhall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs\'\nquarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old\nprince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent\nTikhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what news.--\"Say only that \'the prince\ntold me to ask,\' and come and tell me her answer.\"\n\n\"Inform the prince that labor has begun,\" said Mary Bogdanovna,\ngiving the messenger a significant look.\n\nTikhon went and told the prince.\n\n\"Very good!\" said the prince closing the door behind him, and Tikhon\ndid not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.\n\nAfter a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and,\nseeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his\nperturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed\nhim on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles\nor saying why he had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world\ncontinued its course. Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of\nsuspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable\ndid not lessen but increased. No one slept.\n\nIt was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume\nits sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A\nrelay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German\ndoctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback\nwith lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the\ncountry road with its hollows and snow-covered pools of water.\n\nPrincess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her\nluminous eyes fixed on her nurse\'s wrinkled face (every line of\nwhich she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from\nunder the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.\n\nNurse Savishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely\nhearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds\nof times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess\nMary in Kishenev with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead\nof a midwife.\n\n\"God is merciful, doctors are never needed,\" she said.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the\nwindow, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of\nthe prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the\nlarks returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the\ndamask curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill,\nsnowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the\nstocking she was knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to\ncatch the open casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her\nkerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.\n\n\"Princess, my dear, there\'s someone driving up the avenue!\" she\nsaid, holding the casement and not closing it. \"With lanterns. Most\nlikely the doctor.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God! thank God!\" said Princess Mary. \"I must go and meet\nhim, he does not know Russian.\"\n\nPrincess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the\nnewcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the\nwindow a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went\nout on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow candle which\nguttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, the footman,\nstood looking scared and holding another candle. Still lower, beyond\nthe turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of someone in\nthick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary\nwas saying something.\n\n\"Thank God!\" said the voice. \"And Father?\"\n\n\"Gone to bed,\" replied the voice of Demyan the house steward, who\nwas downstairs.\n\nThen the voice said something more, Demyan replied, and the steps in\nthe felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more\nrapidly.\n\n\"It\'s Andrew!\" thought Princess Mary. \"No it can\'t be, that would be\ntoo extraordinary,\" and at the very moment she thought this, the\nface and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of\nwhich covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman\nstood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed\nand strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up\nthe stairs and embraced his sister.\n\n\"You did not get my letter?\" he asked, and not waiting for a\nreply--which he would not have received, for the princess was unable\nto speak--he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the\ndoctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last\npost station), and again embraced his sister.\n\n\"What a strange fate, Masha darling!\" And having taken off his cloak\nand felt boots, he went to the little princess\' apartment.');

Strands of her black hair\nlay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy\nmouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince\nAndrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on\nwhich she was lying. Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear\nand excitement, rested on him without changing their expression. \"I\nlove you all and have done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so?\nHelp me!\" her look seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not\nrealize the significance of his appearance before her now.

The pangs began again and Mary\nBogdanovna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.\n\nThe doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess\nMary, again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk\nbroke off at every moment. They waited and listened.\n\n\"Go, dear,\" said Princess Mary.\n\nPrince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room\nnext to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and\nbecame confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with\nhis hands and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless,\nanimal moans came through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to\nthe door, and tried to open it. Someone was holding it shut.\n\n\"You can\'t come in! You can\'t!\" said a terrified voice from within.\n\nHe began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more\nseconds went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek--it could not be\nhers, she could not scream like that--came from the bedroom. Prince\nAndrew ran to the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of\nan infant.\n\n\"What have they taken a baby in there for?\" thought Prince Andrew in\nthe first second. \"A baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or\nis the baby born?\"\n\nThen suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail;\ntears choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began\nto cry, sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his\nshirt sleeves tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling\njaw, came out of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor\ngave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman\nrushed out and seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the\nthreshold. He went into his wife\'s room. She was lying dead, in the\nsame position he had seen her in five minutes before and, despite\nthe fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the same expression was\non her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny\nblack hair.\n\n\"I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have\nyou done to me?\"--said her charming, pathetic, dead face.\n\nIn a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and\nsquealed in Mary Bogdanovna\'s trembling white hands.\n\n\nTwo hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his\nfather\'s room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing\nclose to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed\nlike a vise round his son\'s neck, and without a word he began to sob\nlike a child.\n\n\nThree days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew\nwent up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the\nfarewell kiss. And there in the coffin was the same face, though\nwith closed eyes. \"Ah, what have you done to me?\" it still seemed to\nsay, and Prince Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and\nthat he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He\ncould not weep. The old man too came up and kissed the waxen little\nhands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on her breast, and\nto him, too, her face seemed to say: \"Ah, what have you done to me,\nand why?\" And at the sight the old man turned angrily away.\n\n\nAnother five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas\nAndreevich was baptized.

As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of\nthe family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties.\nDolokhov recovered, and Rostov became very friendly with him during\nhis convalescence. Dolokhov lay ill at his mother\'s who loved him\npassionately and tenderly, and old Mary Ivanovna, who had grown fond\nof Rostov for his friendship to her Fedya, often talked to him about\nher son.\n\n\"Yes, Count,\" she would say, \"he is too noble and pure-souled for\nour present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like\na reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it\nhonorable, of Bezukhov?

And there! Bezukhov got off scotfree, while Fedya had to\nbear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go\nthrough!

I know you\nunderstand Fedya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond\nof you. Few people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly\nsoul!\"\n\nDolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostov in a way\nno one would have expected of him.\n\n\"I know people consider me a bad man!\" he said. \"Let them! I don\'t\ncare a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love, I love\nso that I would give my life for them, and the others I\'d throttle\nif they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, and two\nor three friends--you among them--and as for the rest I only care\nabout them in so far as they are harmful or useful.

I have not yet met\nthat divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a\none I\'d give my life for her!

But you don\'t understand it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I quite understand,\" answered Rostov, who was under his\nnew friend\'s influence.\n\nIn the autumn the Rostovs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter\nDenisov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the\nwinter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow, was one of\nthe happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas\nbrought many young men to his parents\' house. Vera was a handsome girl\nof twenty; Sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening\nflower; Natasha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly\namusing, now girlishly enchanting.\n\nAt that time in the Rostovs\' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere\ncharacteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming\ngirls. Every young man who came to the house--seeing those\nimpressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own\nhappiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful\nbursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of\nyoung girls ready for anything and full of hope--experienced the same\nfeeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rostovs\' household a\nreadiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.\n\nAmong the young men introduced by Rostov one of the first was\nDolokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Natasha. She\nalmost quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he\nwas a bad man, and that in the duel with Bezukhov, Pierre was right\nand Dolokhov wrong, and further that he was disagreeable and\nunnatural.\n\n\"There\'s nothing for me to understand,\" she cried out with resolute\nself-will, \"he is wicked and heartless. There now, I like your Denisov\nthough he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so you see I do\nunderstand. I don\'t know how to put it... with this one everything\nis calculated, and I don\'t like that. But Denisov...\"\n\n\"Oh, Denisov is quite different,\" replied Nicholas, implying that\neven Denisov was nothing compared to Dolokhov--\"you must understand\nwhat a soul there is in Dolokhov, you should see him with his\nmother. What a heart!\"\n\n\"Well, I don\'t know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And\ndo you know he has fallen in love with Sonya?\"\n\n\"What nonsense...\"\n\n\"I\'m certain of it; you\'ll see.\"\n\nNatasha\'s prediction proved true. Dolokhov, who did not usually care\nfor the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the\nquestion for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon\nsettled. He came because of Sonya. And Sonya, though she would never\nhave dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time\nDolokhov appeared.\n\nDolokhov often dined at the Rostovs\', never missed a performance\nat which they were present, and went to Iogel\'s balls for young people\nwhich the Rostovs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to Sonya\nand looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his\nglances without coloring, but even the old countess and Natasha\nblushed when they saw his looks.\n\nIt was evident that this strange, strong man was under the\nirresistible influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.\n\nRostov noticed something new in Dolokhov\'s relations with Sonya, but\nhe did not explain to himself what these new relations were.\n\"They\'re always in love with someone,\" he thought of Sonya and\nNatasha. But he was not as much at ease with Sonya and Dolokhov as\nbefore and was less frequently at home.\n\nIn the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war\nwith Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders\nwere given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the\nregular army, and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the\nmilitia. Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow\nnothing but the coming war was talked of. For the Rostov family the\nwhole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that\nNicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the\ntermination of Denisov\'s furlough after Christmas to return with him\nto their regiment. His approaching departure did not prevent his\namusing himself, but rather gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the\ngreater part of his time away from home, at dinners, parties, and\nballs.');

It was a grand farewell dinner, as he\nand Denisov were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany.\nAbout twenty people were present, including Dolokhov and Denisov.\n\nNever had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous\natmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostovs\' house as at\nthis holiday time. \"Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!\nThat is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the\none thing we are interested in here,\" said the spirit of the place.\n\nNicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without\nvisiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been\ninvited, returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he\nnoticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also\nnoticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present. Sonya,\nDolokhov, and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a\nlesser degree Natasha. Nicholas understood that something must have\nhappened between Sonya and Dolokhov before dinner, and with the kindly\nsensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both\nat dinner. On that same evening there was to be one of the balls\nthat Iogel (the dancing master) gave for his pupils during the\nholidays.\n\n\"Nicholas, will you come to Iogel\'s? Please do!\" said Natasha. \"He\nasked you, and Vasili Dmitrich* is also going.\"\n\n\n*Denisov.\n\n\n\"Where would I not go at the countess\' command!\" said Denisov, who\nat the Rostovs\' had jocularly assumed the role of Natasha\'s knight.\n\"I\'m even weady to dance the pas de chale.\"\n\n\"If I have time,\" answered Nicholas. \"But I promised the\nArkharovs; they have a party.\"\n\n\"And you?\" he asked Dolokhov, but as soon as he had asked the\nquestion he noticed that it should not have been put.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" coldly and angrily replied Dolokhov, glancing at Sonya,\nand, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given\nPierre at the Club dinner.\n\n\"There is something up,\" thought Nicholas, and he was further\nconfirmed in this conclusion by the fact that Dolokhov left\nimmediately after dinner. He called Natasha and asked her what was the\nmatter.\n\n\"And I was looking for you,\" said Natasha running out to him. \"I\ntold you, but you would not believe it,\" she said triumphantly. \"He\nhas proposed to Sonya!\"\n\nLittle as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sonya of late,\nsomething seemed to give way within him at this news. Dolokhov was a\nsuitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless,\norphan girl. From the point of view of the old countess and of society\nit was out of the question for her to refuse him. And therefore\nNicholas\' first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with\nSonya.... He tried to say, \"That\'s capital; of course she\'ll forget\nher childish promises and accept the offer,\" but before he had time to\nsay it Natasha began again.\n\n\"And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!\" adding, after a\npause, \"she told him she loved another.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Sonya could not have done otherwise!\" thought Nicholas.\n\n\"Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won\'t change\nonce she has said...\"\n\n\"And Mamma pressed her!\" said Nicholas reproachfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Natasha. \"Do you know, Nicholas--don\'t be angry--but I\nknow you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know\nfor certain that you won\'t marry her.\"\n\n\"Now you don\'t know that at all!\" said Nicholas. \"But I must talk to\nher. What a darling Sonya is!\" he added with a smile.\n\n\"Ah, she is indeed a darling! I\'ll send her to you.\"\n\nAnd Natasha kissed her brother and ran away.\n\nA minute later Sonya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared\nlook. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the\nfirst time since his return that they had talked alone and about their\nlove.\n\n\"Sophie,\" he began, timidly at first and then more and more\nboldly, \"if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and\nadvantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...\"\n\nSonya interrupted him.\n\n\"I have already refused,\" she said hurriedly.\n\n\"If you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...\"\n\nSonya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.\n\n\"Nicholas, don\'t tell me that!\" she said.\n\n\"No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to\nsay it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole\ntruth. I love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....\"\n\n\"That is enough for me,\" said Sonya, blushing.\n\n\"No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love\nagain, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,\nconfidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does\nnot wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider\nDolokhov\'s offer,\" he said, articulating his friend\'s name with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Don\'t say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and\nalways shall, and I want nothing more.\"\n\n\"You are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of\nmisleading you.\"\n\nAnd Nicholas again kissed her hand.');

So said the mothers\nas they watched their young people executing their newly learned\nsteps, and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced\ntill they were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and\nwomen who came to these balls with an air of condescension and found\nthem most enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these\nballs. The two pretty young Princesses Gorchakov met suitors there and\nwere married and so further increased the fame of these dances. What\ndistinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess\nand the presence of the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a\nfeather and bowing according to the rules of his art, as he\ncollected the tickets from all his visitors. There was the fact that\nonly those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of\nthirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first\ntime. With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be,\npretty--so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes.\nSometimes the best of the pupils, of whom Natasha, who was\nexceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas de chale, but\nat this last ball only the ecossaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka,\nwhich was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a\nballroom in Bezukhov\'s house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a\ngreat success. There were many pretty girls and the Rostov girls\nwere among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay.\nThat evening, proud of Dolokhov\'s proposal, her refusal, and her\nexplanation with Nicholas, Sonya twirled about before she left home so\nthat the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was\ntransparently radiant with impulsive joy.\n\nNatasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real\nball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with\npink ribbons.\n\nNatasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She\nwas not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever\nperson she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.\n\n\"Oh, how delightful it is!\" she kept saying, running up to Sonya.\n\nNicholas and Denisov were walking up and down, looking with kindly\npatronage at the dancers.\n\n\"How sweet she is--she will be a weal beauty!\" said Denisov.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Countess Natasha,\" answered Denisov.\n\n\"And how she dances! What gwace!\" he said again after a pause.\n\n\"Who are you talking about?\"\n\n\"About your sister,\" ejaculated Denisov testily.\n\nRostov smiled.\n\n\"My dear count, you were one of my best pupils--you must dance,\"\nsaid little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. \"Look how many charming young\nladies-\" He turned with the same request to Denisov who was also a\nformer pupil of his.\n\n\"No, my dear fellow, I\'ll be a wallflower,\" said Denisov. \"Don\'t you\nwecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. \"You were only\ninattentive, but you had talent--oh yes, you had talent!\"\n\n The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not\nrefuse Iogel and asked Sonya to dance. Denisov sat down by the old\nladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot,\ntold them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the\nyoung people dancing, Iogel with Natasha, his pride and his best\npupil, were the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with\nhis little feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with\nNatasha, who, though shy, went on carefully executing her steps.\nDenisov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber\nin a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was\nbecause he would not and not because he could not. In the middle of\na figure he beckoned to Rostov who was passing:\n\n\"This is not at all the thing,\" he said. \"What sort of Polish\nmazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.\"\n\nKnowing that Denisov had a reputation even in Poland for the\nmasterly way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to\nNatasha:\n\n\"Go and choose Denisov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!\" he said.\n\nWhen it came to Natasha\'s turn to choose a partner, she rose and,\ntripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran\ntimidly to the corner where Denisov sat. She saw that everybody was\nlooking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Denisov was refusing\nthough he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.\n\n\"Please, Vasili Dmitrich,\" Natasha was saying, \"do come!\"\n\n\"Oh no, let me off, Countess,\" Denisov replied.\n\n\"Now then, Vaska,\" said Nicholas.\n\n\"They coax me as if I were Vaska the cat!\" said Denisov jokingly.\n\n\"I\'ll sing for you a whole evening,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!\" said Denisov, and he\nunhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his\npartner\'s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,\nwaiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was\nDenisov\'s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow\nhe felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked\nsideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly\nstamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew\nround the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on\none foot half across the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs\nwas dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and\nspreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood so a\nsecond, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round,\nand, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a\ncircle. Natasha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to\nhim followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round,\nholding her now with his left, now with his right hand, then falling\non one knee he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed\nso impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through\nthe whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he\nsuddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When\nat last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair,\nhe drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natasha did not\neven make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,\nsmiling as if she did not recognize him.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" she brought out.\n\nAlthough Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka,\neveryone was delighted with Denisov\'s skill, he was asked again and\nagain as a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about\nPoland and the good old days. Denisov, flushed after the mazurka and\nmopping himself with his handkerchief, sat down by Natasha and did not\nleave her for the rest of the evening.');

He was at once\nshown to the best room, which Dolokhov had taken for that evening.\nSome twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dolokhov sat\nbetween two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper\nmoney, and he was keeping the bank. Rostov had not seen him since\nhis proposal and Sonya\'s refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought\nof how they would meet.\n\nDolokhov\'s clear, cold glance met Rostov as soon as he entered the\ndoor, as though he had long expected him.\n\n\"It\'s a long time since we met,\" he said. \"Thanks for coming. I\'ll\njust finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will come with his chorus.\"\n\n\"I called once or twice at your house,\" said Rostov, reddening.\n\nDolokhov made no reply.\n\n\"You may punt,\" he said.\n\nRostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once\nhad with Dolokhov. \"None but fools trust to luck in play,\" Dolokhov\nhad then said.\n\n\"Or are you afraid to play with me?\" Dolokhov now asked as if\nguessing Rostov\'s thought.\n\nBeneath his smile Rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the\nClub dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he\nhad felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually\ncruel, action.\n\nRostov felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke\nwith which to reply to Dolokhov\'s words. But before he had thought\nof anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and\ndeliberately so that everyone could hear:\n\n\"Do you remember we had a talk about cards... \'He\'s a fool who\ntrusts to luck, one should make certain,\' and I want to try.\"\n\n\"To try his luck or the certainty?\" Rostov asked himself.\n\n\"Well, you\'d better not play,\" Dolokhov added, and springing a new\npack of cards said: \"Bank, gentlemen!\"\n\nMoving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostov sat down by his\nside and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.\n\n\"Why don\'t you play?\" he asked.\n\nAnd strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up\na card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.\n\n\"I have no money with me,\" he said.\n\n\"I\'ll trust you.\"\n\nRostov staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and\nagain lost. Dolokhov \"killed,\" that is, beat, ten cards of Rostov\'s\nrunning.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Dolokhov after he had dealt for some time. \"Please\nplace your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.\"\n\nOne of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.\n\n\"Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I\nask you to put the money on your cards,\" replied Dolokhov. \"Don\'t\nstint yourself, we\'ll settle afterwards,\" he added, turning to Rostov.\n\nThe game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.\n\nAll Rostov\'s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles\nscored up against him. He wrote \"800 rubles\" on a card, but while\nthe waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to\nhis usual stake of twenty rubles.\n\n\"Leave it,\" said Dolokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking\nat Rostov, \"you\'ll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others\nbut win from you. Or are you afraid of me?\" he asked again.\n\nRostov submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a\nseven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the\nfloor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the\nseven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written\n\"800 rubles\" in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm\nchampagne that was handed him, smiled at Dolokhov\'s words, and with\na sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at Dolokhov\'s\nhands which held the pack. Much depended on Rostov\'s winning or losing\non that seven of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had\ngiven his son two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked\nspeaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all\nhe could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical\nthis time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough\nfor him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more\ntill the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that\nmoney, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of\nsixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word.\nWith a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov\'s hands and thought, \"Now\nthen, make haste and let me have this card and I\'ll take my cap and\ndrive home to supper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and will\ncertainly never touch a card again.\" At that moment his home life,\njokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with Natasha, piquet with\nhis father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the\nPovarskaya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm\nthat it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss,\nlong past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the\nseven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him\nof all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and\nplunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could\nnot be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov\'s\nhands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from\nunder the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a\npipe that were handed him.\n\n\"So you are not afraid to play with me?\" repeated Dolokhov, and as\nif about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in\nhis chair, and began deliberately with a smile:\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen, I\'ve been told there\'s a rumor going about Moscow\nthat I\'m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.\"\n\n\"Come now, deal!\" exclaimed Rostov.\n\n\"Oh, those Moscow gossips!\" said Dolokhov, and he took up the\ncards with a smile.\n\n\"Aah!\" Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The\nseven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He\nhad lost more than he could pay.\n\n\"Still, don\'t ruin yourself!\" said Dolokhov with a side glance at\nRostov as he continued to deal.');

Instead of sixteen\nhundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,\nwhich he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he\nvaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it\nalready exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dolokhov was no longer\nlistening to stories or telling them, but followed every movement of\nRostov\'s hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against\nhim. He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three\nthousand. He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the\nsum of his and Sonya\'s joint ages. Rostov, leaning his head on both\nhands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with\nspilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did\nnot leave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy\nwrists visible from under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he\nloved and hated, held him in their power.\n\n\"Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back\'s\nimpossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or\nquits... it can\'t be!... And why is he doing this to me?\" Rostov\npondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but Dolokhov refused to\naccept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him,\nand at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at\nthe bridge over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came\nfirst to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him,\nnow counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and\ntried staking the total of his losses on it, then he looked round\nfor aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of\nDolokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.\n\n\"He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can\'t want my\nruin. Wasn\'t he my friend? Wasn\'t I fond of him? But it\'s not his\nfault. What\'s he to do if he has such luck?... And it\'s not my fault\neither,\" he thought to himself, \"I have done nothing wrong. Have I\nkilled anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a\nterrible misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago\nI came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to\nbuy that casket for Mamma\'s name day and then going home. I was so\nhappy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I\nwas! When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things\nbegin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place\nat this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned\nagile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has happened?\nI am well and strong and still the same and in the same place. No,\nit can\'t be! Surely it will all end in nothing!\"\n\nHe was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not\nhot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its\nhelpless efforts to seem calm.\n\nThe score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three\nthousand. Rostov had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of\nwhich he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his\nscore, when Dolokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside\nand began rapidly adding up the total of Rostov\'s debt, breaking the\nchalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.\n\n\"Supper, it\'s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!\"\n\nSome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold\noutside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas\nunderstood that it was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:\n\n\"Well, won\'t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,\" as if it\nwere the fun of the game which interested him most.\n\n\"It\'s all up! I\'m lost!\" thought he. \"Now a bullet through my\nbrain--that\'s all that\'s left me!\" And at the same time he said in a\ncheerful voice:\n\n\"Come now, just this one more little card!\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Dolokhov, having finished the addition. \"All\nright! Twenty-one rubles,\" he said, pointing to the figure\ntwenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three\nthousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rostov\nsubmissively unbent the corner of his card and, instead of the six\nthousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.\n\n\"It\'s all the same to me,\" he said. \"I only want to see whether\nyou will let me win this ten, or beat it.\"\n\nDolokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostov detested at that\nmoment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy\nwrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.\n\n\"You owe forty-three thousand, Count,\" said Dolokhov, and stretching\nhimself he rose from the table. \"One does get tired sitting so\nlong,\" he added.\n\n\"Yes, I\'m tired too,\" said Rostov.\n\nDolokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for\nhim to jest.\n\n\"When am I to receive the money, Count?\"\n\nRostov, flushing, drew Dolokhov into the next room.\n\n\"I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?\" he said.\n\n\"I say, Rostov,\" said Dolokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas\nstraight in the eyes, \"you know the saying, \'Lucky in love, unlucky at\ncards.\' Your cousin is in love with you, I know.\"\n\n\"Oh, it\'s terrible to feel oneself so in this man\'s power,\"\nthought Rostov. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father\nand mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be\nto escape it all, and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him\nfrom all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a\ncat does with a mouse.\n\n\"Your cousin...\" Dolokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"My cousin has nothing to do with this and it\'s not necessary to\nmention her!\" he exclaimed fiercely.\n\n\"Then when am I to have it?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" replied Rostov and left the room.');

Excellent!\" exclaimed Natasha. \"Another verse,\" she\nsaid, without noticing Nicholas.\n\n\"Everything\'s still the same with them,\" thought Nicholas,\nglancing into the drawing room, where he saw Vera and his mother\nwith the old lady.\n\n\"Ah, and here\'s Nicholas!\" cried Natasha, running up to him.\n\n\"Is Papa at home?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am so glad you\'ve come!\" said Natasha, without answering him. \"We\nare enjoying ourselves! Vasili Dmitrich is staying a day longer for my\nsake! Did you know?\"\n\n\"No, Papa is not back yet,\" said Sonya.\n\n\"Nicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!\" called the old\ncountess from the drawing room.\n\nNicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently\nat her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the\ndancing room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to\npersuade Natasha to sing.\n\n\"All wight! All wight!\" shouted Denisov. \"It\'s no good making\nexcuses now! It\'s your turn to sing the ba\'cawolla--I entweat you!\"\n\nThe countess glanced at her silent son.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" said he, as if weary of being continually asked the\nsame question. \"Will Papa be back soon?\"\n\n\"I expect so.\"\n\n\"Everything\'s the same with them. They know nothing about it!\nWhere am I to go?\" thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing\nroom where the clavichord stood.\n\nSonya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to\nDenisov\'s favorite barcarolle. Natasha was preparing to sing.\nDenisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.\n\nNicholas began pacing up and down the room.\n\n\"Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There\'s\nnothing to be happy about!\" thought he.\n\nSonya struck the first chord of the prelude.\n\n\"My God, I\'m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my\nbrain is the only thing left me--not singing!\" his thoughts ran on.\n\"Go away? But where to? It\'s one--let them sing!\"\n\nHe continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denisov and the\ngirls and avoiding their eyes.\n\n\"Nikolenka, what is the matter?\" Sonya\'s eyes fixed on him seemed to\nask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.\n\nNicholas turned away from her. Natasha too, with her quick instinct,\nhad instantly noticed her brother\'s condition. But, though she noticed\nit, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from\nsorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself\nas young people often do. \"No, I am too happy now to spoil my\nenjoyment by sympathy with anyone\'s sorrow,\" she felt, and she said to\nherself: \"No, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as\nI am.\"\n\n\"Now, Sonya!\" she said, going to the very middle of the room,\nwhere she considered the resonance was best.\n\nHaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as\nballet dancers do, Natasha, rising energetically from her heels to her\ntoes, stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.\n\n\"Yes, that\'s me!\" she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with\nwhich Denisov followed her.\n\n\"And what is she so pleased about?\" thought Nicholas, looking at his\nsister. \"Why isn\'t she dull and ashamed?\"\n\nNatasha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose, her\neyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her\nsurroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may\nproduce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which\nleave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill\nyou and make you weep.\n\nNatasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing\nseriously, mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing. She\nno longer sang as a child, there was no longer in her singing that\ncomical, childish, painstaking effect that had been in it before;\nbut she did not yet sing well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her\nsaid: \"It is not trained, but it is a beautiful voice that must be\ntrained.\" Only they generally said this some time after she had\nfinished singing. While that untrained voice, with its incorrect\nbreathing and labored transitions, was sounding, even the connoisseurs\nsaid nothing, but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again. In\nher voice there was a virginal freshness, an unconsciousness of her\nown powers, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, which so mingled\nwith her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that\nvoice could be altered without spoiling it.\n\n\"What is this?\" thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely\nopened eyes. \"What has happened to her? How she is singing today!\" And\nsuddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the\nnext note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided\ninto three beats: \"Oh mio crudele affetto.\"... One, two, three... one,\ntwo, three... One... \"Oh mio crudele affetto.\"... One, two, three...\nOne. \"Oh, this senseless life of ours!\" thought Nicholas. \"All this\nmisery, and money, and Dolokhov, and anger, and honor--it\'s all\nnonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natasha, now then, dearest!\nNow then, darling! How will she take that si? She\'s taken it! Thank\nGod!\" And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si\nhe sung a second, a third below the high note. \"Ah, God! How fine! Did\nI really take it? How fortunate!\" he thought.\n\nOh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was\nfinest in Rostov\'s soul! And this something was apart from\neverything else in the world and above everything in the world.\n\"What were losses, and Dolokhov, and words of honor?... All\nnonsense! One might kill and rob and yet be happy...\"');

But no sooner had Natasha finished her barcarolle than\nreality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and\nwent downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old\ncount came in from his Club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing\nhim drive up, went to meet him.\n\n\"Well--had a good time?\" said the old count, smiling gaily and\nproudly at his son.\n\nNicholas tried to say \"Yes,\" but could not: and he nearly burst into\nsobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son\'s\ncondition.\n\n\"Ah, it can\'t be avoided!\" thought Nicholas, for the first and\nlast time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him\nfeel ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his\nfather to let him have the carriage to drive to town:\n\n\"Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting.\nI need some money.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said his father, who was in a specially good humor. \"I\ntold you it would not be enough. How much?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless\nsmile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, \"I have lost a\nlittle, I mean a good deal, a great deal--forty three thousand.\"\n\n\"What! To whom?... Nonsense!\" cried the count, suddenly reddening\nwith an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.\n\n\"I promised to pay tomorrow,\" said Nicholas.\n\n\"Well!...\" said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking\nhelplessly on the sofa.\n\n\"It can\'t be helped It happens to everyone!\" said the son, with a\nbold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as\na worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his\ncrime. He longed to kiss his father\'s hands and kneel to beg his\nforgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it\nhappens to everyone!\n\nThe old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\'s words and\nbegan bustlingly searching for something.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he muttered, \"it will be difficult, I fear, difficult to\nraise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\"\n\nAnd with a furtive glance at his son\'s face, the count went out of\nthe room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at\nall expected this.\n\n\"Papa! Pa-pa!\" he called after him, sobbing, \"forgive me!\" And\nseizing his father\'s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into\ntears.\n\nWhile father and son were having their explanation, the mother and\ndaughter were having one not less important. Natasha came running to\nher mother, quite excited.\n\n\"Mamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...\"\n\n\"Made what?\"\n\n\"Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!\" she exclaimed.\n\nThe countess did not believe her ears. Denisov had proposed. To\nwhom? To this chit of a girl, Natasha, who not so long ago was playing\nwith dolls and who was still having lessons.\n\n\"Don\'t, Natasha! What nonsense!\" she said, hoping it was a joke.\n\n\"Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,\" said Natasha\nindignantly. \"I come to ask you what to do, and you call it\n\'nonsense!\'\"\n\nThe countess shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"If it is true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal, tell him\nhe is a fool, that\'s all!\"\n\n\"No, he\'s not a fool!\" replied Natasha indignantly and seriously.\n\n\"Well then, what do you want? You\'re all in love nowadays. Well,\nif you are in love, marry him!\" said the countess, with a laugh of\nannoyance. \"Good luck to you!\"\n\n\"No, Mamma, I\'m not in love with him, I suppose I\'m not in love with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Well then, tell him so.\"\n\n\"Mamma, are you cross? Don\'t be cross, dear! Is it my fault?\"\n\n\"No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?\"\nsaid the countess smiling.\n\n\"No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It\'s all very\nwell for you,\" said Natasha, with a responsive smile. \"You should have\nseen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came out\naccidently.\"\n\n\"Well, all the same, you must refuse him.\"\n\n\"No, I mustn\'t. I am so sorry for him! He\'s so nice.\"\n\n\"Well then, accept his offer. It\'s high time for you to be married,\"\nanswered the countess sharply and sarcastically.\n\n\"No, Mamma, but I\'m so sorry for him. I don\'t know how I\'m to say\nit.\"\n\n\"And there\'s nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,\"\nsaid the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this\nlittle Natasha as grown up.\n\n\"No, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you\'ll listen\nat the door,\" and Natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing\nhall, where Denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord\nwith his face in his hands.\n\nHe jumped up at the sound of her light step.\n\n\"Nataly,\" he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, \"decide my\nfate. It is in your hands.\"\n\n\"Vasili Dmitrich, I\'m so sorry for you!... No, but you are so\nnice... but it won\'t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall\nalways love you.\"\n\nDenisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did\nnot understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this\ninstant, they heard the quick rustle of the countess\' dress. She\ncame up to them.\n\n\"Vasili Dmitrich, I thank you for the honor,\" she said, with an\nembarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denisov--\"but my\ndaughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son\'s friend, you\nwould have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would\nnot have obliged me to give this refusal.\"\n\n\"Countess...\" said Denisov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face. He\ntried to say more, but faltered.\n\nNatasha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She\nbegan to sob aloud.\n\n\"Countess, I have done w\'ong,\" Denisov went on in an unsteady voice,\n\"but believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I\nwould give my life twice over...\" He looked at the countess, and\nseeing her severe face said: \"Well, good-by, Countess,\" and kissing\nher hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without\nlooking at Natasha.\n\n\nNext day Rostov saw Denisov off. He did not wish to stay another day\nin Moscow. All Denisov\'s Moscow friends gave him a farewell\nentertainment at the gypsies\', with the result that he had no\nrecollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three\nstages of his journey.\n\nAfter Denisov\'s departure, Rostov spent another fortnight in Moscow,\nwithout going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could\nnot at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls\' room.\n\nSonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she\nwanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her\nlove him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of\nher.\n\nHe filled the girls\' albums with verses and music, and having at\nlast sent Dolokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and\nreceived his receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking\nleave of any of his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which\nwas already in Poland.');

At the\nTorzhok post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster\nwould not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,\nhe lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big\nfeet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.\n\n\"Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and\ntea?\" asked his valet.\n\nPierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had\nbegun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same\nquestion--one so important that he took no notice of what went on\naround him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to\nPetersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at\nthis station, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it\nwas a matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours\nor for the rest of his life.\n\nThe postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling\nTorzhok embroidery came into the room offering their services. Without\nchanging his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his\nspectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could\ngo on living without having solved the problems that so absorbed\nhim. He had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day\nhe returned from Sokolniki after the duel and had spent that first\nagonizing, sleepless night. But now, in the solitude of the journey,\nthey seized him with special force. No matter what he thought about,\nhe always returned to these same questions which he could not solve\nand yet could not cease to ask himself. It was as if the thread of the\nchief screw which held his life together were stripped, so that the\nscrew could not get in or out, but went on turning uselessly in the\nsame place.\n\nThe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his\nexcellency to wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let\nhis excellency have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying\nand only wanted to get more money from the traveler.\n\n\"Is this good or bad?\" Pierre asked himself. \"It is good for me, bad\nfor another traveler, and for himself it\'s unavoidable, because he\nneeds money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a\nthrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses.\nBut the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as\npossible. And I,\" continued Pierre, \"shot Dolokhov because I\nconsidered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they\nconsidered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who\nexecuted him--also for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What\nshould one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am\nI? What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?\"\n\nThere was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and\nthat not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer\nwas: \"You\'ll die and all will end. You\'ll die and know all, or cease\nasking.\" But dying was also dreadful.\n\nThe Torzhok peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering\nher wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. \"I have hundreds of\nrubles I don\'t know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered\ncloak looking timidly at me,\" he thought. \"And what does she want\nthe money for? As if that money could add a hair\'s breadth to\nhappiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me\nless a prey to evil and death?--death which ends all and must come\ntoday or tomorrow--at any rate, in an instant as compared with\neternity.\" And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,\nand again it turned uselessly in the same place.\n\nHis servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters,\nby Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous\nstruggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \"And why did she resist her\nseducer when she loved him?\" he thought. \"God could not have put\ninto her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife--as she\nonce was--did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has\nbeen found out, nothing discovered,\" Pierre again said to himself.\n\"All we can know is that we know nothing. And that\'s the height of\nhuman wisdom.\"\n\nEverything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and\nrepellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre\nfound a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.\n\n\"I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this\ngentleman,\" said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another\ntraveler, also detained for lack of horses.\n\nThe newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old\nman, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite\ngrayish color.\n\nPierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a\nbed that had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the\nnewcomer, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off\nhis wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With\na pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn,\nnankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa,\nleaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped\nhair, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, shrewd, and penetrating\nexpression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to\nthe stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a\nquestion about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His\nshriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them\nPierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a\ndeath\'s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as\nit seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant\nwas also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,\nevidently not because he was shaven but because they had never\ngrown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler\'s canteen\nand preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything\nwas ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled\na tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to\nwhom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the\nneed, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with\nthis stranger.\n\nThe servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down,* with an\nunfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be\nwanted.\n\n\n*To indicate he did not want more tea.\n\n\n\"No. Give me the book,\" said the stranger.\n\nThe servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional\nwork, and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him.\nAll at once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and\nagain, leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his\nformer position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not\ntime to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady\nand severe gaze straight on Pierre\'s face.\n\nPierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright\nold eyes attracted him irresistibly.');

Call it what you please, I know that what\nhappened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.\"--\"I regret it very\nmuch, my dear sir.\"\n\nPierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed,\nbent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.\n\n\"I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but\nfor greater reasons.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa\nby way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt\nreluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but,\nsubmitting to him involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.\n\n\"You are unhappy, my dear sir,\" the stranger continued. \"You are\nyoung and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my\npower.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Pierre, with a forced smile. \"I am very grateful\nto you.

On the contrary, I am very glad to make your\nacquaintance,\" said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger\'s\nhands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull--a Masonic\nsign.\n\n\"Allow me to ask,\" he said, \"are you a Mason?\"\n\n\"Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,\" said the\nstranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre\'s eyes. \"And in\ntheir name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the\nconfidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his\nown habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs--\"I am afraid I am very\nfar from understanding--how am I to put it?--I am afraid my way of\nlooking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not\nunderstand one another.\"\n\n\"I know your outlook,\" said the Mason, \"and the view of life you\nmention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,\nis the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit\nof pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if\nI had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of\nlife is a regrettable delusion.\"\n\n\"Just as I may suppose you to be deluded,\" said Pierre, with a faint\nsmile.\n\n\"I should never dare to say that I know the truth,\" said the\nMason, whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision\nand firmness. \"No one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying\nstone on stone with the cooperation of all, by the millions of\ngenerations from our forefather Adam to our own times, is that\ntemple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great\nGod,\" he added, and closed his eyes.\n\n\"I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in God,\"\nsaid Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to\nspeak the whole truth.\n\nThe Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with\nmillions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he,\npoor man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.\n\n\"Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,\" said the Mason. \"You cannot\nknow Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I am unhappy,\" assented Pierre. \"But what am I to do?\"\n\n\"You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You\ndo not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He\nis in thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just\nuttered!\" pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.\n\nHe paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.\n\n\"If He were not,\" he said quietly, \"you and I would not be speaking of\nHim, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou\ndenied?\" he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in\nhis voice. \"Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy\nconception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst\nthou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence\nof such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and\ninfinite in all His attributes?...\"\n\nHe stopped and remained silent for a long time.\n\nPierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.\n\n\"He exists, but to understand Him is hard,\" the Mason began again,\nlooking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the\nleaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could\nnot keep still. \"If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I\ncould bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to\nthee. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence,\nHis infinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts\nhis eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or\nunderstand his own vileness and sinfulness?\" He paused again. \"Who art\nthou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter\nthose blasphemous words,\" he went on, with a somber and scornful\nsmile. \"And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little\nchild, who, playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch, dares\nto say that, as he does not understand its use, he does not believe in\nthe master who made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, from our\nforefather Adam to our own day, we labor to attain that knowledge\nand are still infinitely far from our aim; but in our lack of\nunderstanding we see only our weakness and His greatness....\"\n\nPierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason\'s face\nwith shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but\nbelieving with his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he\naccepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason\'s words, or\nbelieved as a child believes, in the speaker\'s tone of conviction\nand earnestness, or the tremor of the speaker\'s voice--which sometimes\nalmost broke--or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this\nconviction, or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation,\nwhich radiated from his whole being (and which struck Pierre\nespecially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness)--at\nany rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did\nbelieve, and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration, and\nreturn to life.\n\n\"He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,\" said the\nMason.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts\nreawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness,\nin the Mason\'s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.\n\"I don\'t understand,\" he said, \"how it is that the mind of man\ncannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.\"\n\nThe Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.\n\n\"The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish\nto imbibe,\" he said. \"Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure\nvessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of\nmyself can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is so,\" said Pierre joyfully.\n\n\"The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those\nworldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into\nwhich intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.\nThe highest wisdom has but one science--the science of the whole--the\nscience explaining the whole creation and man\'s place in it. To\nreceive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one\'s inner\nself, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to\nperfect one\'s self. And to attain this end, we have the light called\nconscience that God has implanted in our souls.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" assented Pierre.\n\n\"Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask\nthyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained\nrelying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich,\nyou are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all\nthese good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?\"\n\n\"No, I hate my life,\" Pierre muttered, wincing.\n\n\"Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art\npurified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How\nhave you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving\neverything from society and giving nothing in return. You have\nbecome the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you\ndone for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of\nthousands of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally?\nNo! You have profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is\nwhat you have done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of\nservice to your neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness.\nThen you married, my dear sir--took on yourself responsibility for the\nguidance of a young woman; and what have you done? You have not helped\nher to find the way of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an\nabyss of deceit and misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and\nyou say you do not know God and hate your life. There is nothing\nstrange in that, my dear sir!\"\n\nAfter these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse,\nagain leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes.\nPierre looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face\nand moved his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, \"Yes, a\nvile, idle, vicious life!\" but dared not break the silence.\n\nThe Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called\nhis servant.\n\n\"How about the horses?\" he asked, without looking at Pierre.\n\n\"The exchange horses have just come,\" answered the servant. \"Will\nyou not rest here?\"\n\n\"No, tell them to harness.\"\n\n\"Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me\nall, and without promising to help me?\" thought Pierre, rising with\ndowncast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at\nthe Mason. \"Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a\ncontemptible and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not\nwant to,\" thought Pierre. \"But this man knows the truth and, if he\nwished to, could disclose it to me.\"\n\nPierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The\ntraveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began\nfastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bezukhov, and\nsaid in a tone of indifferent politeness:\n\n\"Where are you going to now, my dear sir?\"\n\n\"I?... I\'m going to Petersburg,\" answered Pierre, in a childlike,\nhesitating voice. \"I thank you. I agree with all you have said. But do\nnot suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what\nyou would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it\nis I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me,\nand perhaps I may...\"\n\nPierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.\n\nThe Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.\n\n\"Help comes from God alone,\" he said, \"but such measure of help as\nour Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to\nPetersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski\" (he took out his notebook\nand wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).\n\"Allow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital,\nfirst of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and\ndo not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good\njourney, my dear sir,\" he added, seeing that his servant had\nentered... \"and success.\"\n\nThe traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre saw from the\npostmaster\'s book. Bazdeev had been one of the best-known Freemasons\nand Martinists, even in Novikov\'s time. For a long while after he\nhad gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and\ndown the room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous\nsense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful,\nirreproachable, virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It\nseemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow\nforgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not a trace of his former\ndoubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed in the possibility\nof the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one\nanother in the path of virtue, and that is how Freemasonry presented\nitself to him.');

One thing\nhe continually realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto\nunknown to him, of believing in the possibility of attaining\nperfection, and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men,\nwhich Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to him. A week after his arrival,\nthe young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in\nPetersburg society, came into his room one evening in the official and\nceremonious manner in which Dolokhov\'s second had called on him,\nand, having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that\nthere was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre.\n\n\"I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,\" he said\nwithout sitting down. \"A person of very high standing in our\nBrotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order\nbefore the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I\nconsider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person\'s wishes. Do you wish\nto enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?\"\n\nThe cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always\nbefore met at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most\nbrilliant women, surprised Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, I do wish it,\" said he.\n\nWillarski bowed his head.\n\n\"One more question, Count,\" he said, \"which I beg you to answer in all\nsincerity--not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you\nrenounced your former convictions--do you believe in God?\"\n\nPierre considered.\n\n\"Yes... yes, I believe in God,\" he said.\n\n\"In that case...\" began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.\n\n\"Yes, I do believe in God,\" he repeated.\n\n\"In that case we can go,\" said Willarski. \"My carriage is at your\nservice.\"\n\nWillarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre\'s inquiries\nas to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied\nthat brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had\nonly to tell the truth.\n\nHaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had\nits headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a\nsmall well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the\naid of a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in\nstrange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him,\nsaid something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to\na small wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never\nseen before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski\nbound Pierre\'s eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching\nsome hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed\nhim, and taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the\nknot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a\nshamefaced smile. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a\npuckered, though smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain,\ntimid steps.\n\nHaving led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.\n\n\"Whatever happens to you,\" he said, \"you must bear it all manfully\nif you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.\" (Pierre nodded\naffirmatively.) \"When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover\nyour eyes,\" added Willarski. \"I wish you courage and success,\" and,\npressing Pierre\'s hand, he went out.\n\nLeft alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice he\nshrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to\ntake it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his\neyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs\nalmost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He\nexperienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of\nwhat would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He\nfelt curious to know what was going to happen and what would be\nrevealed to him; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had\ncome when he would at last start on that path of regeneration and on\nthe actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he\nmet Joseph Alexeevich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took\nthe bandage off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black\ndarkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre\nwent nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which\nlay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with\nthe lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth. After\nreading the first words of the Gospel: \"In the beginning was the\nWord and the Word was with God,\" Pierre went round the table and saw a\nlarge open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones\ninside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on\nan entirely new life quite unlike the old one, he expected\neverything to be unusual, even more unusual than what he was seeing. A\nskull, a coffin, the Gospel--it seemed to him that he had expected all\nthis and even more. Trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around.\n\"God, death, love, the brotherhood of man,\" he kept saying to himself,\nassociating these words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened\nand someone came in.\n\nBy the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed,\nhe saw rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the\ndarkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the\ntable and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.\n\nThis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his\nchest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which\nrose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit\nup from below.\n\n\"For what have you come hither?\" asked the newcomer, turning in\nPierre\'s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. \"Why have\nyou, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not\nseen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,\nenlightenment?\"\n\nAt the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre\nfelt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his\nboyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially\na complete stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man.\nWith bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by\nwhich name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the\nBrotherhood was known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor\na man he knew, Smolyaninov, and it mortified him to think that the\nnewcomer was an acquaintance--he wished him simply a brother and a\nvirtuous instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so\nthat the Rhetor had to repeat his question.\n\n\"Yes... I... I... desire regeneration,\" Pierre uttered with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Smolyaninov, and went on at once: \"Have you any\nidea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach\nyour aim?\" said he quietly and quickly.\n\n\"I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,\" said Pierre,\nwith a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his\nexcitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in\nRussian.\n\n\"What is your conception of Freemasonry?\"\n\n\"I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men\nwho have virtuous aims,\" said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the\ninadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he\nspoke. \"I imagine...\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this\nanswer. \"Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?\"\n\n\"No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,\" said\nPierre, so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him\nwhat he was saying. \"I have been an atheist,\" answered Pierre.\n\n\"You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,\ntherefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?\" said the\nRhetor, after a moment\'s pause.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" assented Pierre.\n\nThe Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his\nbreast, and began to speak.\n\n\"Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,\" he said,\n\"and if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood\nwith profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation\non which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the\npreservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important\nmystery... which has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from\nthe first man--a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends.\nBut since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use\nit unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not\neveryone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim,\nthat of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their\nhearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to\nus by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery,\nand thereby to render them capable of receiving it.\n\n\"By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to\nimprove the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of\npiety and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the\nevil which sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you\nagain.\"\n\n\"To combat the evil which sways the world...\" Pierre repeated, and a\nmental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his\nmind. He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and\nhe addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself\nvicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and\ndeed, imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the\nthree objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving\nmankind, especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery\nmentioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem\nto him essential, and the second aim, that of purifying and\nregenerating himself, did not much interest him because at that moment\nhe felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former\nfaults and was ready for all that was good.\n\nHalf an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of\nthe seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon\'s\ntemple, which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These\nvirtues were:  1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order.\n 2. Obedience to those of higher ranks in the Order.  3. Morality.  4.\nLove of mankind.  5. Courage.  6. Generosity.  7. The love of death.\n\n\"In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,\" the\nRhetor said, \"to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but\nas a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue\nfrom this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense\nand peace.\"\n\n\"Yes, that must be so,\" thought Pierre, when after these words the\nRhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. \"It must be\nso, but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which\nis only now gradually opening before me.\" But five of the other\nvirtues which Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt\nalready in his soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind,\nand especially obedience--which did not even seem to him a virtue, but\na joy. (He now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to\nsubmit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot\nwhat the seventh virtue was and could not recall it.\n\nThe third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre\nwhether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to\nall that would be required of him.\n\n\"I am ready for everything,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"I must also inform you,\" said the Rhetor, \"that our Order\ndelivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which\nmay perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after\nwisdom and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see\ntherein should already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere,\nmore than words could do. You will perhaps also see in your further\ninitiation a like method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the\nancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A\nhieroglyph,\" said the Rhetor, \"is an emblem of something not\ncognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling\nthose of the symbol.\"\n\nPierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He\nlistened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his\nordeal was about to begin.\n\n\"If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,\" said the Rhetor\ncoming closer to Pierre. \"In token of generosity I ask you to give\nme all your valuables.\"\n\n\"But I have nothing here,\" replied Pierre, supposing that he was\nasked to give up all he possessed.\n\n\"What you have with you: watch, money, rings....\"\n\nPierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage\nfor some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that\nhad been done, the Rhetor said:\n\n\"In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.\"\n\nPierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to\nthe Rhetor\'s instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre\'s\nleft breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his\ntrousers to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his\nright boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save\nthis stranger the trouble, but the Mason told him that was not\nnecessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike\nsmile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on\nhis face against his will, Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and\nlegs apart, before his brother Rhetor, and awaited his further\ncommands.\n\n\"And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief\npassion,\" said the latter.\n\n\"My passion! I have had so many,\" replied Pierre.\n\n\"That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on\nthe path of virtue,\" said the Mason.\n\nPierre paused, seeking a reply.\n\n\"Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?\" He\nwent over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to\ngive the pre-eminence.\n\n\"Women,\" he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.\n\nThe Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this\nanswer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that\nlay on the table, again bound his eyes.\n\n\"For the last time I say to you--turn all your attention upon\nyourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in\npassion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not\nwithout us but within....\"\n\nPierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing\nsource of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.');

To fresh questions as to the firmness of his\nresolution Pierre replied: \"Yes, yes, I agree,\" and with a beaming,\nchildlike smile, his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and\ntimidly in one slippered and one booted foot, he advanced, while\nWillarski held a sword to his bare chest. He was conducted from that\nroom along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was at last\nbrought to the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was\nanswered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors opened before\nthem. A bass voice (Pierre was still blindfolded) questioned him as to\nwho he was, when and where he was born, and so on. Then he was again\nled somewhere still blindfolded, and as they went along he was told\nallegories of the toils of his pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of\nthe Eternal Architect of the universe, and of the courage with which\nhe should endure toils and dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre\nnoticed that he was spoken of now as the \"Seeker,\" now as the\n\"Sufferer,\" and now as the \"Postulant,\" to the accompaniment of\nvarious knockings with mallets and swords. As he was being led up to\nsome object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his\nconductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of\nthem insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet. After\nthat they took his right hand, placed it on something, and told him to\nhold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to\nrepeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of\nthe Order. The candles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted,\nas Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told that he would now see the\nlesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint\nlight of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men\nstanding before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor\'s and holding\nswords in their hands pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man\nwhose white shirt was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved\nforward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce\nit. But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once\nblindfolded again.\n\n\"Now thou hast seen the lesser light,\" uttered a voice. Then the\ncandles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light;\nthe bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said\ntogether: \"Sic transit gloria mundi.\"\n\nPierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the\nroom and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black\nsat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some\nof them Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President\'s chair\nsat a young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from\nhis neck. On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre had met at\nAnna Pavlovna\'s two years before. There were also present a very\ndistinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the\nKuragins\'. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words\nof the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was\na star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet\nwith various figures worked upon it, at the other was something\nresembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it\nstood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the\nbrothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right\nangles, and bade him lie down, saying that he must prostrate himself\nat the Gates of the Temple.\n\n\"He must first receive the trowel,\" whispered one of the brothers.\n\n\"Oh, hush, please!\" said another.\n\nPierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without\nobeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. \"Where am I? What am I\ndoing? Aren\'t they laughing at me? Shan\'t I be ashamed to remember\nthis?\" But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the\nserious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone\nthrough, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast at\nhis hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,\nprostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the\nfeeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before.\nWhen he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white\nleather apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a\ntrowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master\naddressed him. He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain\nthe whiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength and purity;\nthen of the unexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse\nhis own heart from vice, and indulgently to smooth with it the heart\nof his neighbor. As to the first pair of gloves, a man\'s, he said that\nPierre could not know their meaning but must keep them. The second\npair of man\'s gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of\nthe third, a pair of women\'s gloves, he said: \"Dear brother, these\nwoman\'s gloves are intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom\nyou shall honor most of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity\nof heart to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in\nMasonry.\" And after a pause, he added: \"But beware, dear brother, that\nthese gloves do not deck hands that are unclean.\" While the Grand\nMaster said these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew\nembarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more confused, blushed like a\nchild till tears came to his eyes, began looking about him uneasily,\nand an awkward pause followed.\n\nThis silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to\nthe rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation\nof all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a\ntrowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows,\nand so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs\nof the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit\ndown. The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very\nlong, and Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a\nstate to understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the\nlast words of the statutes and these remained in his mind.\n\n\"In our temples we recognize no other distinctions,\" read the\nGrand Master, \"but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any\ndistinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother\'s aid\nwhoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that\nfalleth, never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and\ncourteous. Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy\nhappiness with thy neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that\nbliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him\ngood. Thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of\nthe ancient dignity which thou hast lost.\"\n\nHe finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with\ntears of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to\nanswer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met\nhim on all sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all\nthese men only brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work\nwith them.\n\nThe Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down\nin their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the\nnecessity of humility.\n\nThe Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed,\nand the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of \"Collector of\nAlms\" went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to\nsubscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride\nsubscribed the same amount as the others.\n\nThe meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he\nhad returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of\nyears, had become completely changed, and had quite left behind his\nformer habits and way of life.');

Now\nand then his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he\nformed in imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at\nthe Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the\nEmperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre\nproposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to\nthe welfare of his serfs. He was joyfully planning this new life, when\nPrince Vasili suddenly entered the room.\n\n\"My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you\nquarreled with Helene, mon cher? You are under a delusion,\" said\nPrince Vasili, as he entered. \"I know all about it, and I can tell you\npositively that Helene is as innocent before you as Christ was\nbefore the Jews.\"\n\nPierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasili interrupted him.\n\n\"And why didn\'t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I\nknow all about it and understand it all,\" he said. \"You behaved as\nbecomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won\'t go\ninto that. But consider the position in which you are placing her\nand me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,\" he added,\nlowering his voice. \"She is living in Moscow and you are here.\nRemember, dear boy,\" and he drew Pierre\'s arm downwards, \"it is simply\na misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her\na letter at once, and she\'ll come here and all will be explained, or\nelse, my dear boy, let me tell you it\'s quite likely you\'ll have to\nsuffer for it.\"\n\nPrince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look.\n\n\"I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a\nkeen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to\nHelene.\"\n\nPierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vasili\ndid not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to\nspeak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he\nhad firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words\nof the Masonic statutes, \"be kindly and courteous,\" recurred to him.\nHe blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with\nhimself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life--to\nsay an unpleasant thing to a man\'s face, to say what the other,\nwhoever he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to\nPrince Vasili\'s tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he\nwould be unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what\nhe said now his future depended--whether he would follow the same\nold road, or that new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on\nwhich he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life.\n\n\"Now, dear boy,\" said Prince Vasili playfully, \"say \'yes,\' and\nI\'ll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.\"\n\nBut before Prince Vasili had finished his playful speech, Pierre,\nwithout looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his\nfather, muttered in a whisper:\n\n\"Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!\" And he jumped up\nand opened the door for him.\n\n\"Go!\" he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of\nconfusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasili\'s face.\n\n\"What\'s the matter with you? Are you ill?\"\n\n\"Go!\" the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasili had to go\nwithout receiving any explanation.\n\nA week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the\nMasons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went\naway to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and\nOdessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new\nactivity.');

But the story of the\nduel, confirmed by Pierre\'s rupture with his wife, was the talk of\nsociety. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension\nwhen he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was\nthe best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society\nafter his marriage--when the marriageable daughters and their\nmothers had nothing to hope from him--especially as he did not know\nhow, and did not wish, to court society\'s favor. Now he alone was\nblamed for what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and\nsubject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after\nPierre\'s departure Helene returned to Petersburg, she was received\nby all her acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade\nof deference due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her\nhusband Helene assumed a dignified expression, which with\ncharacteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its\nsignificance. This expression suggested that she had resolved to\nendure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross\nlaid upon her by God. Prince Vasili expressed his opinion more openly.\nHe shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and, pointing to\nhis forehead, remarked:\n\n\"A bit touched--I always said so.\"\n\n\"I said from the first,\" declared Anna Pavlovna referring to Pierre,\n\"I said at the time and before anyone else\" (she insisted on her\npriority) \"that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved\nideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody was\nin raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and\nwhen, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my\nsoirees. And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then\nand foretold all that has happened.\"\n\nAnna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of\nsoirees as before--such as she alone had the gift of arranging--at\nwhich was to be found \"the cream of really good society, the bloom\nof the intellectual essence of Petersburg,\" as she herself put it.\nBesides this refined selection of society Anna Pavlovna\'s receptions\nwere also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new\nand interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the\nstate of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court\nsociety so dearly and distinctly indicated.\n\nToward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon\'s\ndestruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the\nsurrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when\nour troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with\nNapoleon was beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one of her soirees. The\n\"cream of really good society\" consisted of the fascinating Helene,\nforsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte\nwho had just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a\nyoung man referred to in that drawing room as \"a man of great merit\"\n(un homme de beaucoup de merite), a newly appointed maid of honor\nand her mother, and several other less noteworthy persons.\n\nThe novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening\nwas Boris Drubetskoy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from\nthe Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.\n\nThe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company\nthat evening was this:\n\n\"Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to\ncountenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance\nand mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not\ncease to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say\nto the King of Prussia and others: \'So much the worse for you. Tu l\'as\nvoulu, George Dandin,\' that\'s all we have to say about it!\"\n\nWhen Boris, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the\ndrawing room, almost all the company had assembled, and the\nconversation, guided by Anna Pavlovna, was about our diplomatic\nrelations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her.\n\nBoris, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and\nself-possessed, entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the\nuniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his\nrespects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle.\n\nAnna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him\nto several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered\ndescription of each.\n\n\"Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, M. Krug, the charge d\'affaires from\nCopenhagen--a profound intellect,\" and simply, \"Mr. Shitov--a\nman of great merit\"--this of the man usually so described.\n\nThanks to Anna Mikhaylovna\'s efforts, his own tastes, and the\npeculiarities of his reserved nature, Boris had managed during his\nservice to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a\nvery important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to\nPrussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He\nhad become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which\nhe had been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign\nmight rank incomparably higher than a general, and according to\nwhich what was needed for success in the service was not effort or\nwork, or courage, or perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to\nget on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself often\nsurprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of\nothers to understand these things. In consequence of this discovery\nhis whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends, all\nhis plans for his future, were completely altered. He was not rich,\nbut would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others, and\nwould rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to\nbe seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in\nan old uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of\nonly those above him in position and who could therefore be of use\nto him. He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of\nthe Rostovs\' house and of his childish love for Natasha was unpleasant\nto him and he had not once been to see the Rostovs since the day of\nhis departure for the army. To be in Anna Pavlovna\'s drawing room he\nconsidered an important step up in the service, and he at once\nunderstood his role, letting his hostess make use of whatever interest\nhe had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each face, appraising\nthe possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of those present,\nand the advantages that might accrue. He took the seat indicated to\nhim beside the fair Helene and listened to the general conversation.\n\n\"Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable\nthat not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure\nthem, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the\nactual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,\" said the Danish charge\nd\'affaires.\n\n\"The doubt is flattering,\" said \"the man of profound intellect,\"\nwith a subtle smile.\n\n\"We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of\nAustria,\" said Mortemart. \"The Emperor of Austria can never have\nthought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear vicomte,\" put in Anna Pavlovna, \"L\'Urope\" (for some\nreason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined\nFrench pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing\nwith a Frenchman), \"L\'Urope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere.\"*\n\n\n*\"Europe will never be our sincere ally.\"\n\n\nAfter that Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the\nKing of Prussia, in order to draw Boris into the conversation.\n\nBoris listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his\nturn, but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his\nneighbor, the beautiful Helene, whose eyes several times met those\nof the handsome young aide-de-camp with a smile.\n\nSpeaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna very naturally\nasked Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state\nhe found the Prussian army. Boris, speaking with deliberation, told\nthem in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies\nand the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of\nhis own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he\nengrossed the general attention, and Anna Pavlovna felt that the\nnovelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her\nvisitors. The greatest attention of all to Boris\' narrative was\nshown by Helene. She asked him several questions about his journey and\nseemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army. As soon\nas he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile.\n\n\"You absolutely must come and see me,\" she said in a tone that\nimplied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this\nwas absolutely necessary.\n\n\"On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.\"\n\nBoris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a\nconversation with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away on the\npretext that her aunt wished to hear him.\n\n\"You know her husband, of course?\" said Anna Pavlovna, closing her\neyes and indicating Helene with a sorrowful gesture. \"Ah, she is\nsuch an unfortunate and charming woman! Don\'t mention him before\nher--please don\'t! It is too painful for her!\"');

The life of old Prince Bolkonski,\nPrince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.\n\nIn 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief\nthen appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout\nRussia. Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly\nnoticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed,\nhe did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been\nappointed by the Emperor himself, and this fresh opportunity for\naction gave him new energy and strength. He was continually\ntraveling through the three provinces entrusted to him, was pedantic\nin the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruelty with his\nsubordinates, and went into everything down to the minutest details\nhimself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from\nher father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with\nthe wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called\nhim). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse\nSavishna in the late princess\' rooms and Princess Mary spent most of\nthe day in the nursery, taking a mother\'s place to her little nephew\nas best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passionately\nfond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give\nher friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel--as she called\nher nephew--and playing with him.\n\nNear the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over\nthe tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble\nmonument brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread\nwings ready to fly upwards. The angel\'s upper lip was slightly\nraised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the\nchapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that\nthe angel\'s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But\nwhat was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing\nto his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to\ngive the angel\'s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he\nhad read on the face of his dead wife: \"Ah, why have you done this\nto me?\"\n\nSoon after Prince Andrew\'s return the old prince made over to him\na large estate, Bogucharovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald\nHills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with\nBald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal\nto bearing with his father\'s peculiarities, and partly because he\nneeded solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo, began building\nand spent most of his time there.\n\nAfter the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved\nnot to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and\neverybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the\nrecruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his\nson seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old\nman, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new\ncampaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the\nwar and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.\n\nOn February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.\nPrince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father\'s\nabsence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman\nwho had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and\nletters for Prince Andrew.\n\nNot finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the\nletters to Princess Mary\'s apartments, but did not find him there.\nHe was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.\n\n\"If you please, your excellency, Petrusha has brought some\npapers,\" said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting\non a child\'s little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he\npoured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of\nwater.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said crossly, and, his hand shaking\nunintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the\nmixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought\nit.\n\nThere were in the room a child\'s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a\ntable, a child\'s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew\nwas sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was\nburning on the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light\ndid not fall on the cot.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside\nthe cot where she was standing, \"better wait a bit... later...\"\n\n\"Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things\noff--and this is what comes of it!\" said Prince Andrew in an\nexasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.\n\n\"My dear, really... it\'s better not to wake him... he\'s asleep,\"\nsaid the princess in a tone of entreaty.\n\nPrince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed,\nwineglass in hand.\n\n\"Perhaps we\'d really better not wake him,\" he said hesitating.\n\n\"As you please... really... I think so... but as you please,\" said\nPrincess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had\nprevailed. She drew her brother\'s attention to the maid who was\ncalling him in a whisper.\n\nIt was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the\nboy who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their\nhousehold doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town,\nthey had been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by\nsleeplessness and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one\nanother and reproached and disputed with each other.\n\n\"Petrusha has come with papers from your father,\" whispered the\nmaid.\n\nPrince Andrew went out.\n\n\"Devil take them!\" he muttered, and after listening to the verbal\ninstructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his\nfather\'s letter, he returned to the nursery.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"Still the same. Wait, for heaven\'s sake. Karl Ivanich always says\nthat sleep is more important than anything,\" whispered Princess Mary\nwith a sigh.\n\nPrince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.\n\n\"Confound you and your Karl Ivanich!\" He took the glass with the\ndrops and again went up to the cot.\n\n\"Andrew, don\'t!\" said Princess Mary.\n\nBut he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his\neyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.\n\n\"But I wish it,\" he said. \"I beg you--give it him!\"\n\nPrincess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively\nand calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed\nhoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and\nsat down on a sofa in the next room.\n\nHe still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them\nmechanically he began reading. The old prince, now and then using\nabbreviations, wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as\nfollows:\n\n\nHave just this moment received by special messenger very joyful\nnews--if it\'s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete\nvictory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,\nand the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a\nGerman--I congratulate him! I can\'t make out what the commander at\nKorchevo--a certain Khandrikov--is up to; till now the additional\nmen and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say\nI\'ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week. Have\nreceived another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from\nPetenka--he took part in it--and it\'s all true. When mischief-makers\ndon\'t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is said to be\nfleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to Korchevo without\ndelay and carry out instructions!\n\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It\nwas a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin. He folded\nit up without reading it and reread his father\'s letter, ending with\nthe words: \"Gallop off to Korchevo and carry out instructions!\"\n\n\"No, pardon me, I won\'t go now till the child is better,\" thought\nhe, going to the door and looking into the nursery.\n\nPrincess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the\nbaby.\n\n\"Ah yes, and what else did he say that\'s unpleasant?\" thought Prince\nAndrew, recalling his father\'s letter. \"Yes, we have gained a\nvictory over Bonaparte, just when I\'m not serving. Yes, yes, he\'s\nalways poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!\" And he began reading\nBilibin\'s letter which was written in French. He read without\nunderstanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment,\nwhat he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of\nall else.');

Bilibin wrote that the obligation\nof diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in\nPrince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the\nbile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the\narmy. The letter was old, having been written before the battle at\nPreussisch-Eylau.\n\n\"Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,\" wrote\nBilibin, \"as you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I\nhave certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for\nme; what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.\n\n\"I begin ab ovo. \'The enemy of the human race,\' as you know, attacks\nthe Prussians.

We have\neverything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,\na commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success\nmight have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so\nyoung, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozorovski and\nKamenski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,\nSuvorov-like, in a kibitka, and is received with acclamations of joy\nand triumph.\n\n\"On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails\nare taken to the field marshal\'s room, for he likes to do everything\nhimself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those\nmeant for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters\naddressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field\nmarshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters\nfrom the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts\ninto one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything,\nseizes the letters, opens them, and reads those from the Emperor\naddressed to others. \'Ah! So that\'s the way they treat me! No\nconfidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then!\nGet along with you!\' So he writes the famous order of the day to\nGeneral Bennigsen:\n\n\'I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the\narmy.

I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I\nrecover. In regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the\ninformation that if the army remains in its present bivouac another\nfortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring.\n\n\"\'Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is\nalready in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great\nand glorious task for which he was chosen.

My\nremoval from the army does not produce the slightest stir--a blind man\nhas left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.\'\n\n\"The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,\nisn\'t it logical?\n\n\"This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly\ninteresting and entertaining. After the field marshal\'s departure it\nappears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.\nBuxhowden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen\ndoes not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who\nare within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the\nopportunity to fight a battle \'on his own hand\' as the Germans say. He\ndoes so. This is the battle of Pultusk, which is considered a great\nvictory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as\nyou know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or\nlost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say;\nand according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk. In\nshort, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg\nwith news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from\nPetersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory,\ndoes not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden. During\nthis interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of\nmaneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack\nthe enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxhowden who by right of\nseniority should be our chief. So energetically do we pursue this aim\nthat after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to\nseparate ourselves from our enemy, who at the moment is not Bonaparte\nbut Buxhowden. General Buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by\na superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that\nenabled us to escape him. Buxhowden pursues us--we scuttle. He hardly\ncrosses the river to our side before we recross to the other. At last\nour enemy. Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are angry,\nand the result is a challenge on Buxhowden\'s part and an epileptic fit\non Bennigsen\'s. But at the critical moment the courier who carried the\nnews of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg returns bringing our\nappointment as commander in chief, and our first foe, Buxhowden, is\nvanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But\nas it turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before\nus--namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread,\nmeat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads\nimpassable. The Orthodox begin looting, and in a way of which our last\ncampaign can give you no idea. Half the regiments form bands and scour\nthe countryside and put everything to fire and sword. The inhabitants\nare totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is\neverywhere. Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters, and the\ncommander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them. During\none of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my\ndressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of\ndivisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear this will\noblige one half the army to shoot the other.\"\n\nAt first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,\nin spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust\nBilibin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When\nhe had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away.\nIt was not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life\nout there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his\neyes, rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what\nhe had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly\nhe thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized\nwith alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he\nwas reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and\nopened it.\n\nJust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from\nhim with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the\ncot.\n\n\"My dear,\" he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind\nhim.\n\nAs often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was\nseized by an unreasoning panic--it occurred to him that the child\nwas dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.\n\n\"All is over,\" he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his\nforehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find\nit empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the\ncurtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could\nnot find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about\ntill he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and\nwas smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.\n\nPrince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had\nalready lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught\nhim, tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The\nsoft forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand;\neven the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was\nnot dead, but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent.\nPrince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart,\nthis helpless little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him,\ngazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed\nunder the blanket. He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow\nappeared under the curtain of the cot. He did not look round, but\nstill gazing at the infant\'s face listened to his regular breathing.\nThe dark shadow was Princess Mary, who had come up to the cot with\nnoiseless steps, lifted the curtain, and dropped it again behind\nher. Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his\nhand to her. She pressed it.\n\n\"He has perspired,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"I was coming to tell you so.\"\n\nThe child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his\nforehead against the pillow.\n\nPrince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain\nher luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy\nthat were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him,\nslightly catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a\nwarning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain\nas if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut\noff from all the world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away,\nruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain.\n\n\"Yes, this is the one thing left me now,\" he said with a sigh.');

He told them that\nsteps would be taken immediately to free his serfs--and that till then\nthey were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their\nbabies were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to\nthe serfs, punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and\nhospitals, asylums, and schools were to be established on all the\nestates. Some of the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among\nthem) listened with alarm, supposing these words to mean that the\nyoung count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of\nmoney, some after their first fright were amused by Pierre\'s lisp\nand the new words they had not heard before, others simply enjoyed\nhearing how the master talked, while the cleverest among them,\nincluding the chief steward, understood from this speech how they\ncould best handle the master for their own ends.\n\nThe chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre\'s intentions,\nbut remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go\ninto the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.\n\nDespite Count Bezukhov\'s enormous wealth, since he had come into\nan income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a\nyear, Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him\nan allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the\nfollowing budget:\n\nAbout 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank,\nabout 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town\nhouse, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was\ngiven in pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was\nsent to the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The\nbuilding of a new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in\neach of the last two years, and he did not know how the rest, about\n100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost every year he was obliged to\nborrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of\nfires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuilding factories\nand workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face was one for\nwhich he had very little aptitude or inclination--practical business.\n\nHe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But he\nfelt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these\nconsultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with\nthem or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the\nstate of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the\nnecessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities\nwith serf labor, to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand,\nPierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs,\nwhich the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the\nloans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of a speedy\nemancipation.\n\nThe steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested\nselling the forests in the province of Kostroma, the land lower down\nthe river, and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all\nof which operations according to him were connected with such\ncomplicated measures--the removal of injunctions, petitions,\npermits, and so on--that Pierre became quite bewildered and only\nreplied:\n\n\"Yes, yes, do so.\"\n\nPierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled\nhim to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only\ntried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The\nsteward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he\nconsidered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and\ntroublesome to himself.\n\nIn Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened\nto make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer,\nthe largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre\'s\ngreatest weakness--the one to which he had confessed when admitted\nto the Lodge--were so strong that he could not resist them. Again\nwhole days, weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush\nand were as much occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches,\nand balls, giving him no time for reflection, as in Petersburg.\nInstead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old\nlife, only in new surroundings.\n\nOf the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not\nfulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral\nlife, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two--morality and the\nlove of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled\nanother of the precepts--that of reforming the human race--and had\nother virtues--love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.\n\nIn the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way\nhe intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his\norders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom\nGod had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.\n\nThe chief steward, who considered the young count\'s attempts\nalmost insane--unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the\nserfs--made some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation\nof the serfs as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large\nbuildings--schools, hospitals, and asylums--on all the estates\nbefore the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for\nceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for\njust such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the\nbread and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of\nhis master, would touch and delude him.\n\nThe southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna\ncarriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on\nPierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more\npicturesque than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and\ntouchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere\nwere receptions, which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a\njoyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In one place the peasants\npresented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint\nPaul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits\nhe had conferred on them, to build a new chantry to the church at\ntheir own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In\nanother place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him\nfor releasing them from hard work. On a third estate the priest,\nbearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded by children whom, by\nthe count\'s generosity, he was instructing in reading, writing, and\nreligion. On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick\nbuildings erected or in course of erection, all on one plan, for\nhospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon to be opened.\nEverywhere he saw the stewards\' accounts, according to which the\nserfs\' manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching\nthanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats.\n\nWhat Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him\nwith bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter\nand Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter\'s\nday, and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had\nbegun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in\nthat villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know\nthat since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his\nland, they did still harder work on their own land. He did not know\nthat the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by\nhis exactions, and that the pupils\' parents wept at having to let\nhim take their children and secured their release by heavy payments.\nHe did not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being\nbuilt by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased, though\nlessened on paper. He did not know that where the steward had shown\nhim in the accounts that the serfs\' payments had been diminished by\na third, their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a\nhalf. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and\nquite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left\nPetersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his \"brother-instructor\"\nas he called the Grand Master.\n\n\"How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,\"\nthought Pierre, \"and how little attention we pay to it!\"\n\nHe was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at\nreceiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do\nfor these simple, kindly people.\n\nThe chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly\nthrough the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with\na toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,\npressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above\nall the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it\nwas.\n\nPierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be\ndifficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would\nhappen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though\nreluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward promised to do\nall in his power to carry out the count\'s wishes, seeing clearly\nthat not only would the count never be able to find out whether all\nmeasures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to\nrelease them from the Land Bank, but would probably never even inquire\nand would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing\nempty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all\nthat other people\'s serfs gave--that is to say, all that could be\ngot out of them.');

The\nhouse lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and\nwith banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that\nstretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which\nwere a few fir trees.\n\nThe homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables,\na bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular facade\nstill in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly\nlaid out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps\nand a water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were\nstraight, the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore\nan impress of tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre\nmet, in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a\nsmall newly built lodge close to the pond. Anton, a man who had looked\nafter Prince Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage,\nsaid that the prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little\nanteroom.\n\nPierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house\nafter the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend\nin Petersburg.\n\nHe quickly entered the small reception room with its\nstill-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone\nfarther, but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" came a sharp, unpleasant voice.\n\n\"A visitor,\" answered Anton.\n\n\"Ask him to wait,\" and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed\nback.\n\nPierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to\nface with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre\nembraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek\nand looked at him closely.\n\n\"Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\nPierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with\nsurprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly\nand there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and\nlifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give\nthem a joyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner,\npaler, and more manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre\ntill he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow\nindicating prolonged concentration on some one thought.\n\nAs is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged\nseparation, it was long before their conversation could settle on\nanything. They put questions and gave brief replies about things\nthey knew ought to be talked over at length. At last the\nconversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first\nlightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierre\'s\njourneys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and\ndespondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend\'s look was now\nstill more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to\nPierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past\nor the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to\nsympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter\nbegan to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms,\ndreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew\'s\npresence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had\nbeen particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He\nchecked himself, fearing to seem naive, yet he felt an irresistible\ndesire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a\nquite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.\n\n\"I can\'t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly\nknow myself again.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\" said Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\"Well, and you? What are your plans?\"\n\n\"Plans!\" repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \"My plans?\" he said,\nas if astonished at the word. \"Well, you see, I\'m building. I mean\nto settle here altogether next year....\"\n\nPierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\'s face,\nwhich had grown much older.\n\n\"No, I meant to ask...\" Pierre began, but Prince Andrew\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your\ntravels and all you have been doing on your estates.\"\n\nPierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as\nfar as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had\nbeen made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre\'s story of what\nhe had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he\nlistened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what\nPierre was telling him.\n\nPierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend\'s company\nand at last became silent.\n\n\"I\'ll tell you what, my dear fellow,\" said Prince Andrew, who\nevidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, \"I\nam only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am\ngoing back to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of\ncourse you know her already,\" he said, evidently trying to entertain a\nvisitor with whom he now found nothing in common. \"We will go after\ndinner. And would you now like to look round my place?\"\n\nThey went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the\npolitical news and common acquaintances like people who do not know\neach other intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and\ninterest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its\nbuildings, but even here, while on the scaffolding, in the midst of\na talk explaining the future arrangements of the house, he interrupted\nhimself:\n\n\"However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and\nthen we\'ll set off.\"\n\nAt dinner, conversation turned on Pierre\'s marriage.\n\n\"I was very much surprised when I heard of it,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\nPierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said\nhurriedly: \"I will tell you some time how it all happened. But you\nknow it is all over, and forever.\"\n\n\"Forever?\" said Prince Andrew. \"Nothing\'s forever.\"\n\n\"But you know how it all ended, don\'t you? You heard of the duel?\"\n\n\"And so you had to go through that too!\"\n\n\"One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,\" said\nPierre.\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Prince Andrew. \"To kill a vicious dog is a very good\nthing really.\"\n\n\"No, to kill a man is bad--wrong.\"\n\n\"Why is it wrong?\" urged Prince Andrew. \"It is not given to man to\nknow what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will\nerr, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.\"\n\n\"What does harm to another is wrong,\" said Pierre, feeling with\npleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was\nroused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought\nhim to his present state.\n\n\"And who has told you what is bad for another man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Bad! Bad!\" exclaimed Pierre. \"We all know what is bad for\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is\nsomething I cannot inflict on others,\" said Prince Andrew, growing\nmore and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new\noutlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. \"I only know two very real\nevils in life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of\nthose evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole\nphilosophy now.\"\n\n\"And love of one\'s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?\" began Pierre. \"No,\nI can\'t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to\nhave to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself\nand ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least trying\"\n(Pierre\'s modesty made him correct himself) \"to live for others,\nonly now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I shall\nnot agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are\nsaying.\" Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.\n\n\"When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you\'ll get on with her,\"\nhe said. \"Perhaps you are right for yourself,\" he added after a\nshort pause, \"but everyone lives in his own way. You lived for\nyourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found\nhappiness when you began living for others. I experienced just the\nreverse. I lived for glory.--And after all what is glory? The same\nlove of others, a desire to do something for them, a desire for\ntheir approval.--So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite,\nruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"But what do you mean by living only for yourself?\" asked Pierre,\ngrowing excited. \"What about your son, your sister, and your father?\"\n\n\"But that\'s just the same as myself--they are not others,\" explained\nPrince Andrew. \"The others, one\'s neighbors, le prochain, as you and\nPrincess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil.\nLe prochain--your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.\"\n\nAnd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He\nevidently wished to draw him on.\n\n\"You are joking,\" replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.\n\"What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even\ndoing a little--though I did very little and did it very badly? What\nevil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people\nlike ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and\ntruth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed\nin a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and\nconsolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying\nof disease without help while material assistance could so easily be\nrendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum\nfor the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a\npeasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give\nthem rest and leisure?\" said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. \"And I have\ndone that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done\nsomething toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a\ngood action, and more than that, you can\'t make me believe that you do\nnot think so yourself. And the main thing is,\" he continued, \"that I\nknow, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is\nthe only sure happiness in life.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you put it like that it\'s quite a different matter,\" said\nPrince Andrew. \"I build a house and lay out a garden, and you build\nhospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what\'s\nright and what\'s good must be judged by one who knows all, but not\nby us. Well, you want an argument,\" he added, \"come on then.\"\n\nThey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which\nserved as a veranda.\n\n\"Come, let\'s argue then,\" said Prince Andrew, \"You talk of schools,\"\nhe went on, crooking a finger, \"education and so forth; that is, you\nwant to raise him\" (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking\noff his cap) \"from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual\nneeds, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only\nhappiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him\nof. I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him\nmy means. Then you say, \'lighten his toil.\' But as I see it,\nphysical labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his\nexistence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can\'t help\nthinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I\ncan\'t sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can\'t help\nthinking, just as he can\'t help plowing and mowing; if he didn\'t, he\nwould go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand\nhis terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he\ncould not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die.\nThe third thing--what else was it you talked about?\" and Prince Andrew\ncrooked a third finger. \"Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit,\nhe is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch him up. He will drag\nabout as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for another ten years. It\nwould be far easier and simpler for him to die. Others are being\nborn and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be different if\nyou grudged losing a laborer--that\'s how I regard him--but you want to\ncure him from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides,\nwhat a notion that medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!\" said\nhe, frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that\nit was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he\nspoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long\ntime. His glance became more animated as his conclusions became more\nhopeless.\n\n\"Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!\" said Pierre. \"I don\'t understand\nhow one can live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long\nago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so\nthat I don\'t live at all--everything seems hateful to me... myself\nmost of all. Then I don\'t eat, don\'t wash... and how is it with\nyou?...\"\n\n\"Why not wash? That is not cleanly,\" said Prince Andrew; \"on the\ncontrary one must try to make one\'s life as pleasant as possible.\nI\'m alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best\nI can without hurting others.\"\n\n\"But with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would\nsit without moving, undertaking nothing....\"\n\n\"Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do\nnothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me\nthe honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to\nget out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary\nqualifications for it--the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness\nnecessary for the position. Then there\'s this house, which must be\nbuilt in order to have a nook of one\'s own in which to be quiet. And\nnow there\'s this recruiting.\"\n\n\"Why aren\'t you serving in the army?\"\n\n\"After Austerlitz!\" said Prince Andrew gloomily. \"No, thank you very\nmuch! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active\nRussian army. And I won\'t--not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk\nthreatening Bald Hills--even then I wouldn\'t serve in the Russian\narmy! Well, as I was saying,\" he continued, recovering his\ncomposure, \"now there\'s this recruiting. My father is chief in command\nof the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active service is\nto serve under him.\"\n\n\"Then you are serving?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nHe paused a little while.\n\n\"And why do you serve?\"\n\n\"Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men\nof his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he\nhas too energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited\npower that he is terrible, and now he has this authority of a\ncommander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had\nbeen two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster\'s\nclerk at Yukhnovna hanged,\" said Prince Andrew with a smile. \"So I\nam serving because I alone have any influence with my father, and\nnow and then can save him from actions which would torment him\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Well, there you see!\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is not as you imagine,\" Prince Andrew continued. \"I did\nnot, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who\nhad stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been\nvery glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father--that again\nis for myself.\"\n\nPrince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered\nfeverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there\nwas no desire to do good to his neighbor.\n\n\"There now, you wish to liberate your serfs,\" he continued; \"that is\na very good thing, but not for you--I don\'t suppose you ever had\nanyone flogged or sent to Siberia--and still less for your serfs. If\nthey are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don\'t suppose they are\nany the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and\nthe stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it\nis a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon\nthemselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being\nable to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people\nI pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You\nmay not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those\ntraditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more\nirritable, become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot\nrestrain themselves and grow more and more miserable.\"\n\nPrince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking\nthat these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his\nfather\'s case.\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n\"So that\'s what I\'m sorry for--human dignity, peace of mind, purity,\nand not the serfs\' backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you\nmay, always remain the same backs and foreheads.\"\n\n\"No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,\" said\nPierre.');

Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the\nsilence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good\ntemper.\n\nPointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making\nin his husbandry.\n\nPierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and\napparently immersed in his own thoughts.\n\nHe was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did\nnot see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid,\nenlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he\nshould say, he felt that Prince Andrew with one word, one argument,\nwould upset all his teaching, and he shrank from beginning, afraid\nof exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred.\n\n\"No, but why do you think so?\" Pierre suddenly began, lowering his\nhead and looking like a bull about to charge, \"why do you think so?\nYou should not think so.\"\n\n\"Think? What about?\" asked Prince Andrew with surprise.\n\n\"About life, about man\'s destiny. It can\'t be so. I myself thought\nlike that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don\'t\nsmile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it\nwas: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal,\naspects of humanity.\"\n\nAnd he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince\nAndrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed\nfrom the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality,\nbrotherhood, and love.\n\n\"Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the\nrest is a dream,\" said Pierre. \"Understand, my dear fellow, that\noutside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree\nwith you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to\nlive out his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But\nmake our fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood,\ngive yourself up to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once\nfeel yourself, as I have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible\nchain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven,\" said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence\nto Pierre\'s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels\nprevented his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it,\nand by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew\'s eyes and by\nhis silence, Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that\nPrince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.\n\nThey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they\nhad to cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed\non it, they also stepped on the raft.\n\nPrince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed\nsilently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.\n\n\"Well, what do you think about it?\" Pierre asked. \"Why are you\nsilent?\"\n\n\"What do I think about it? I am listening to you. It\'s all very\nwell.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of\nlife, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who\nare we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see\nwhat you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I\ndon\'t see it.\"\n\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\"Do you believe in a future life?\" he asked.\n\n\"A future life?\" Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no\ntime to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as\nhe knew Prince Andrew\'s former atheistic convictions.\n\n\"You say you can\'t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor\ncould I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the\nend of everything. On earth, here on this earth\" (Pierre pointed to\nthe fields), \"there is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the\nuniverse, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we\nwho are now the children of earth are--eternally--children of the\nwhole universe. Don\'t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast\nharmonious whole? Don\'t I feel that I form one link, one step, between\nthe lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of\nbeings in whom the Deity--the Supreme Power if you prefer the term--is\nmanifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to\nman, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go\nfarther and farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing\nvanishes in this world, but that I shall always exist and always\nhave existed. I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits,\nand that in this world there is truth.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is Herder\'s theory,\" said Prince Andrew, \"but it is not\nthat which can convince me, dear friend--life and death are what\nconvince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound\nup with one\'s own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped\nto make it right\" (Prince Andrew\'s voice trembled and he turned away),\n\"and suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to\nexist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe\nthere is.... That\'s what convinces, that is what has convinced me,\"\nsaid Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" said Pierre, \"isn\'t that what I\'m saying?\"\n\n\"No. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the\nnecessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with\nsomeone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere,\nand you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have\nlooked in....\"\n\n\"Well, that\'s it then! You know that there is a there and there is a\nSomeone? There is the future life. The Someone is--God.\"\n\nPrince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long\nsince been taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The\nsun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was\nstarring the puddles near the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the\nastonishment of the footmen, coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on\nthe raft and talked.\n\n\"If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and\nman\'s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must\nlive, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on\nthis scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there,\nin the Whole,\" said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.\n\nPrince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening\nto Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of\nthe sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness.\nPierre became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the\nwaves of the current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew\nfelt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre\'s words,\nwhispering:\n\n\"It is true, believe it.\"\n\nHe sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at\nPierre\'s face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his\nsuperior friend.\n\n\"Yes, if it only were so!\" said Prince Andrew. \"However, it is\ntime to get on,\" he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at\nthe sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since\nAusterlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on\nthat battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering,\nsomething that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and\nyouthful, in his soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the\ncustomary conditions of his life, but he knew that this feeling\nwhich he did not know how to develop existed within him. His meeting\nwith Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew\'s life. Though\noutwardly he continued to live in the same old way, inwardly he\nbegan a new life.');

As they approached the\nhouse, Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre\'s attention to a\ncommotion going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a\nwallet on her back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black\ngarment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up.\nTwo women ran out after them, and all four, looking round at the\ncarriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch.\n\n\"Those are Mary\'s \'God\'s folk,\'\" said Prince Andrew. \"They have\nmistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she\ndisobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she\nreceives them.\"\n\n\"But what are \'God\'s folk\'?\" asked Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet\nthem, and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was\nexpected back soon.\n\nThe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any\nminute.\n\nPrince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always\nkept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father\'s house;\nhe himself went to the nursery.\n\n\"Let us go and see my sister,\" he said to Pierre when he returned.\n\"I have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her\n\'God\'s folk.\' It will serve her right, she will be confused, but you\nwill see her \'God\'s folk.\' It\'s really very curious.\"\n\n\"What are \'God\'s folk\'?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Come, and you\'ll see for yourself.\"\n\nPrincess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her\nface when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before\nthe icon stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing\na monk\'s cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near\nthem, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek\nexpression on her childlike face.\n\n\"Andrew, why didn\'t you warn me?\" said the princess, with mild\nreproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her\nchickens.\n\n\"Charmee de vous voir. Je suis tres contente de vous voir,\"* she\nsaid to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child,\nand now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife,\nand above all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward\nhim. She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to\nsay, \"I like you very much, but please don\'t laugh at my people.\"\nAfter exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.\n\n\n*\"Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.\"\n\n\n\"Ah, and Ivanushka is here too!\" said Prince Andrew, glancing with a\nsmile at the young pilgrim.\n\n\"Andrew!\" said Princess Mary, imploringly. \"Il faut que vous sachiez\nque c\'est une femme,\"* said Prince Andrew to Pierre.\n\n\"Andrew, au nom de Dieu!\"*[2] Princess Mary repeated.\n\n\n*\"You must know that this is a woman.\"\n\n*[2] \"For heaven\'s sake.\"\n\n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew\'s ironical tone toward the\npilgrims and Princess Mary\'s helpless attempts to protect them were\ntheir customary long-established relations on the matter.\n\n\"Mais, ma bonne amie,\" said Prince Andrew, \"vous devriez au\ncontraire m\'etre reconnaissante de ce que j\'explique a Pierre votre\nintimite avec ce jeune homme.\"*\n\n\n*\"But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for\nexplaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man.\"\n\n\n\"Really?\" said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and\nseriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him)\ninto Ivanushka\'s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about,\nlooked round at them all with crafty eyes.\n\nPrincess Mary\'s embarrassment on her people\'s account was quite\nunnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman,\nlowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had\nturned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside\nit, and sat quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered\nanother cup of tea. Ivanushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked\nwith sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men.\n\n\"Where have you been? To Kiev?\" Prince Andrew asked the old woman.\n\n\"I have, good sir,\" she answered garrulously. \"Just at Christmastime\nI was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at\nthe shrine of the saint. And now I\'m from Kolyazin, master, where a\ngreat and wonderful blessing has been revealed.\"\n\n\"And was Ivanushka with you?\"\n\n\"I go by myself, benefactor,\" said Ivanushka, trying to speak in a\nbass voice. \"I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo...\"\n\nPelageya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell\nwhat she had seen.\n\n\"In Kolyazin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.\"\n\n\"What is it? Some new relics?\" asked Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Andrew, do leave off,\" said Princess Mary. \"Don\'t tell him,\nPelageya.\"\n\n\"No... why not, my dear, why shouldn\'t I? I like him. He is kind, he\nis one of God\'s chosen, he\'s a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles,\nI remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he\'s one of\nGod\'s own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says, \'Why are\nyou not going to the right place? Go to Kolyazin where a\nwonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.\' On\nhearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.\"\n\nAll were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,\ndrawing in her breath.\n\n\"So I come, master, and the people say to me: \'A great blessing\nhas been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed\nMother, the Holy Virgin Mother of God\'....\"\n\n\"All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,\" said Princess\nMary, flushing.\n\n\"Let me ask her,\" said Pierre. \"Did you see it yourselves?\" he\ninquired.\n\n\"Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the\nface like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother\'s cheek\nit drops and drops....\"\n\n\"But, dear me, that must be a fraud!\" said Pierre, naively, who\nhad listened attentively to the pilgrim.\n\n\"Oh, master, what are you saying?\" exclaimed the horrified Pelageya,\nturning to Princess Mary for support.\n\n\"They impose on the people,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Lord Jesus Christ!\" exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing\nherself. \"Oh, don\'t speak so, master! There was a general who did\nnot believe, and said, \'The monks cheat,\' and as soon as he\'d said\nit he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the\nKiev catacombs came to him and said, \'Believe in me and I will make\nyou whole.\' So he begged: \'Take me to her, take me to her.\' It\'s the\nreal truth I\'m telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought,\nquite blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and\nsays, \'Make me whole,\' says he, \'and I\'ll give thee what the Tsar\nbestowed on me.\' I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the\nicon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! It\'s a sin\nto speak so. God will punish you,\" she said admonishingly, turning\nto Pierre.\n\n\"How did the star get into the icon?\" Pierre asked.\n\n\"And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?\" said\nPrince Andrew, with a smile.\n\nPelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.\n\n\"Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!\" she began,\nher pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. \"Master, what have you\nsaid? God forgive you!\" And she crossed herself. \"Lord forgive him! My\ndear, what does it mean?...\" she asked, turning to Princess Mary.\nShe got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She\nevidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a\nhouse where such things could be said, and was at the same time\nsorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house.\n\n\"Now, why need you do it?\" said Princess Mary. \"Why did you come\nto me?...\"\n\n\"Come, Pelageya, I was joking,\" said Pierre. \"Princesse, ma\nparole, je n\'ai pas voulu l\'offenser.* I did not mean anything, I\nwas only joking,\" he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his\noffense. \"It was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.\"\n\n\n*\"Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.\"\n\n\nPelageya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre\'s face there was such a\nlook of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now\nat her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.');

Today he is cheerful and in\ngood spirits, but that is the effect of your visit--he is not often\nlike that. If you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs\nactivity, and this quiet regular life is very bad for him. Others\ndon\'t notice it, but I see it.\"\n\nToward ten o\'clock the men servants rushed to the front door,\nhearing the bells of the old prince\'s carriage approaching. Prince\nAndrew and Pierre also went out into the porch.\n\n\"Who\'s that?\" asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out\nof the carriage.\n\n\"Ah! Very glad! Kiss me,\" he said, having learned who the young\nstranger was.\n\nThe old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.\n\nBefore supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father\'s study,\nfound him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining\nthat a time would come when there would be no more wars. The old\nprince disputed it chaffingly, but without getting angry.\n\n\"Drain the blood from men\'s veins and put in water instead, then\nthere will be no more war! Old women\'s nonsense--old women\'s\nnonsense!\" he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately on\nthe shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,\nevidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over\nthe papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to\nhim and began to talk business.\n\n\"The marshal, a Count Rostov, hasn\'t sent half his contingent. He\ncame to town and wanted to invite me to dinner--I gave him a pretty\ndinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,\" the old prince\nwent on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. \"A\nfine fellow--your friend--I like him! He stirs me up. Another says\nclever things and one doesn\'t care to listen, but this one talks\nrubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps\nI\'ll come and sit with you at supper. We\'ll have another dispute. Make\nfriends with my little fool, Princess Mary,\" he shouted after\nPierre, through the door.\n\nOnly now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the\nstrength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm\nwas not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his\nfamily and with the household. With the stern old prince and the\ngentle, timid Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre\nat once felt like an old friend. They were all fond of him already.\nNot only Princess Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the\npilgrims, gave him her most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old\n\"Prince Nicholas\" (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and\nlet himself be taken in his arms, and Michael Ivanovich and\nMademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he\ntalked to the old prince.\n\nThe old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre\'s\naccount. And during the two days of the young man\'s visit he was\nextremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.\n\nWhen Pierre had gone and the members of the household met\ntogether, they began to express their opinions of him as people always\ndo after a new acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one\nsaid anything but what was good of him.');

When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned\nuniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dementyev and\nsaw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrushka gleefully\nshouted to his master, \"The count has come!\" and Denisov, who had been\nasleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace\nhim, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostov\nexperienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his\nsister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could\nnot speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and\nprecious as his parents\' house.\n\nWhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and\nhad been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had\ngone out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little\ninterests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and\nbound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense\nof peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in\nhis own place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was\nnone of all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not\nknow his right place and took mistaken decisions; here was no Sonya\nwith whom he ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was\nno possibility of going there or not going there; here there were\nnot twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a\nvariety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of\nwhom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there\nwere none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his\nfather, and nothing to recall that terrible loss to Dolokhov. Here, in\nthe regiment, all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided\ninto two unequal parts: one, our Pavlograd regiment; the other, all\nthe rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment,\neverything was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a\ngood fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The\ncanteenkeeper gave one credit, one\'s pay came every four months, there\nwas nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do nothing that\nwas considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and, when given an order,\nto do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely ordered--and all\nwould be well.\n\nHaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this\nregimental life, Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on\nlying down to rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was\nall the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to Dolokhov (for\nwhich, in spite of all his family\'s efforts to console him, he could\nnot forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault\nby serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a\nperfectly first-rate comrade and officer--in a word, a splendid man\naltogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so\npossible in the regiment.\n\nAfter his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his\nparents in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now\nresolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the\ndebt to his parents.\n\nOur army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at\nPultusk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It\nwas awaiting the Emperor\'s arrival and the beginning of a new\ncampaign.\n\nThe Pavlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had\nserved in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in\nRussia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of\nthe campaign. It had been neither at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau\nand, when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the\ncampaign, was attached to Platov\'s division.\n\nPlatov\'s division was acting independently of the main army. Several\ntimes parts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the\nenemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal\nOudinot\'s carriages. In April the Pavlograds were stationed\nimmovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German\nvillage.\n\nA thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river\nbroke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions\nfor the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no\ntransports could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and\ndeserted villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of\nthese.\n\nEverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled--if\nany remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be\ntaken from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead\nof taking anything from them, often gave them the last of their\nrations.\n\nThe Pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but\nhad lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the\nhospitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or\nthe swelling that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and\nhardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the\nhospitals. When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just\nshowing out of the ground that looked like asparagus, which, for\nsome reason, they called \"Mashka\'s sweet root.\" It was very bitter,\nbut they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with\ntheir sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not to do so, as\nit was a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke\nout among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face,\nwhich the doctors attributed to eating this root. But in spite of\nall this, the soldiers of Denisov\'s squadron fed chiefly on\n\"Mashka\'s sweet root,\" because it was the second week that the last of\nthe biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man\nand the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.\n\nThe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the\nthatched roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with\ntufts of felty winter hair.\n\nDespite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living\njust as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms,\nthe hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed\ntheir horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the\nthatched roofs in place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the\ncaldrons from which they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food\nand their hunger. As usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires,\nsteamed themselves before them naked; smoked, picked out and baked\nsprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened to stories of\nPotemkin\'s and Suvorov\'s campaigns, or to legends of Alesha the Sly,\nor the priest\'s laborer Mikolka.\n\nThe officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,\nhalf-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes\nand, in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied\nthemselves as before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money,\nthough there was no food), some with more innocent games, such as\nquoits and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely\nspoken of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly\nbecause there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly.\n\nRostov lived, as before, with Denisov, and since their furlough they\nhad become more friendly than ever. Denisov never spoke of Rostov\'s\nfamily, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him,\nRostov felt that the elder hussar\'s luckless love for Natasha played a\npart in strengthening their friendship. Denisov evidently tried to\nexpose Rostov to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action\ngreeted his safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging\nexpeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come\nin search of provisions, Rostov found a family consisting of an old\nPole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad,\nhungry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a\nconveyance. Rostov brought them to his quarters, placed them in his\nown lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old man was\nrecovering. One of his comrades, talking of women, began chaffing\nRostov, saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it\nwould not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish\ngirl he had saved. Rostov took the joke as an insult, flared up, and\nsaid such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all Denisov\ncould do to prevent a duel. When the officer had gone away, Denisov,\nwho did not himself know what Rostov\'s relations with the Polish\ngirl might be, began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper, and\nRostov replied:\n\n\"Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can\'t\ntell you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....\"\n\nDenisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room\nwithout looking at Rostov, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.\n\n\"Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs are!\" he muttered, and Rostov\nnoticed tears in his eyes.');

Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut,\ndug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf.\nThe hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into\nvogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight\ninches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were\ncut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself\nwas the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander,\nhad a board, lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve\nas a table. On each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a\nbreadth of about two and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads\nand couches. The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in\nthe middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew\nclose to the table. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the\nsoldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at\nthe farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a\nwindow. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers\' campfire were\nplaced on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the \"reception\nroom\"--as Denisov called that part of the hut--and it was then so warm\nthat the officers, of whom there were always some with Denisov and\nRostov, sat in their shirt sleeves.\n\nIn April, Rostov was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and\neight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers,\nchanged his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got\nwarm, then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner,\nand, his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on\nbut his shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his\nhead. He was pleasantly considering the probability of being\npromoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition, and\nwas awaiting Denisov, who had gone out somewhere and with whom he\nwanted a talk.\n\nSuddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the\nhut, evidently much excited. Rostov moved to the window to see whom he\nwas speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topcheenko.\n\n\"I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff!\" Denisov\nwas shouting. \"And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some\nfwom the fields.\"\n\n\"I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they\ndon\'t obey,\" answered the quartermaster.\n\nRostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: \"Let\nhim fuss and bustle now, my job\'s done and I\'m lying down--capitally!\"\nHe could hear that Lavrushka--that sly, bold orderly of Denisov\'s--was\ntalking, as well as the quartermaster. Lavrushka was saying\nsomething about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when\nhe had gone out for provisions.\n\nThen Denisov\'s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.\n\"Saddle! Second platoon!\"\n\n\"Where are they off to now?\" thought Rostov.\n\nFive minutes later, Denisov came into the hut, climbed with muddy\nboots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things\nabout, took his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again.\nIn answer to Rostov\'s inquiry where he was going, he answered\nvaguely and crossly that he had some business.\n\n\"Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!\" said Denisov\ngoing out, and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing\nthrough the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had\ngone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not\nleave the hut till toward evening. Denisov had not yet returned. The\nweather had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet\nwere playing svayka, laughing as they threw their missiles which\nburied themselves in the soft mud. Rostov joined them. In the middle\nof the game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen\nhussars on their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the\nhussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars\nsurrounded them.\n\n\"There now, Denisov has been worrying,\" said Rostov, \"and here are\nthe provisions.\"\n\n\"So they are!\" said the officers. \"Won\'t the soldiers be glad!\"\n\nA little behind the hussars came Denisov, accompanied by two\ninfantry officers with whom he was talking.\n\nRostov went to meet them.\n\n\"I warn you, Captain,\" one of the officers, a short thin man,\nevidently very angry, was saying.\n\n\"Haven\'t I told you I won\'t give them up?\" replied Denisov.\n\n\"You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny--seizing the\ntransport of one\'s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two\ndays.\"\n\n\"And mine have had nothing for two weeks,\" said Denisov.\n\n\"It is robbery! You\'ll answer for it, sir!\" said the infantry\nofficer, raising his voice.\n\n\"Now, what are you pestewing me for?\" cried Denisov, suddenly losing\nhis temper. \"I shall answer for it and not you, and you\'d better not\nbuzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!\" he shouted at the\nofficers.\n\n\"Very well, then!\" shouted the little officer, undaunted and not\nriding away. \"If you are determined to rob, I\'ll...\"\n\n\"Go to the devil! quick ma\'ch, while you\'re safe and sound!\" and\nDenisov turned his horse on the officer.\n\n\"Very well, very well!\" muttered the officer, threateningly, and\nturning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.\n\n\"A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!\" shouted Denisov\nafter him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a\nmounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostov, he burst out laughing.\n\n\"I\'ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!\" he said.\n\"After all, can\'t let our men starve.\"\n\nThe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an\ninfantry regiment, but learning from Lavrushka that the transport\nwas unescorted, Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force. The\nsoldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared\nthem with the other squadrons.\n\nThe next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov, and\nholding his fingers spread out before his eyes said:\n\n\"This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and\nwon\'t begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff\nand settle the business there in the commissariat department and if\npossible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not,\nas the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a\nrow and the affair may end badly.\"\n\nFrom the regimental commander\'s, Denisov rode straight to the\nstaff with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he\ncame back to his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen\nhim in. Denisov could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rostov\nasked what was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and\nthreats in a hoarse, feeble voice.\n\nAlarmed at Denisov\'s condition, Rostov suggested that he should\nundress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.\n\n\"Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but\nI\'ll always thwash scoundwels... and I\'ll tell the Empewo\'...\nIce...\" he muttered.\n\nThe regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely\nnecessary to bleed Denisov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken\nfrom his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had\nhappened to him.\n\n\"I get there,\" began Denisov. \"\'Now then, where\'s your chief\'s\nquarters?\' They were pointed out. \'Please to wait.\' \'I\'ve widden\ntwenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait.\nAnnounce me.\' Vewy well, so out comes their head chief--also took it\ninto his head to lecture me: \'It\'s wobbewy!\'--\'Wobbewy,\' I say, \'is\nnot done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him\nwho takes them to fill his own pockets!\' \'Will you please be silent?\'\n\'Vewy good!\' Then he says: \'Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner,\nbut your affair will be passed on to headquarters.\' I go to the\ncommissioner. I enter, and at the table... who do you think? No, but\nwait a bit!... Who is it that\'s starving us?\" shouted Denisov, hitting\nthe table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the\ntable nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about.\n\"Telyanin! \'What? So it\'s you who\'s starving us to death! Is it? Take\nthis and this!\' and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... \'Ah,\nwhat a... what a...!\' and I sta\'ted fwashing him... Well, I\'ve had a\nbit of fun I can tell you!\" cried Denisov, gleeful and yet angry, his\nwhite teeth showing under his black mustache. \"I\'d have killed him if\nthey hadn\'t taken him away!\"\n\n\"But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,\" said Rostov. \"You\'ve\nset your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again.\"\n\nDenisov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke\ncalm and cheerful.\n\nBut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov\'s and\nDenisov\'s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully\nshowed them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental\ncommander in which inquiries were made about yesterday\'s occurrence.\nThe adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad\nturn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the\nseverity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded,\ndegradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.\n\nThe case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after\nseizing the transports, Major Denisov, being drunk, went to the\nchief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief,\nthreatened to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the\noffice and given two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm\nof one of them.\n\nIn answer to Rostov\'s renewed questions, Denisov said, laughing,\nthat he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed\nup in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not\nin the least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels\ndared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not\neasily forget.\n\nDenisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostov knew\nhim too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart\nhe feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was\nevidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices\nfrom the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov was ordered\nto hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before\nthe staff of his division to explain his violence at the\ncommissariat office. On the previous day Platov reconnoitered with two\nCossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Denisov, as was his\nwont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A\nbullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of\nhis leg. Perhaps at another time Denisov would not have left the\nregiment for so slight a wound, but now he took advantage of it to\nexcuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital.');

Rostov, who felt his friend\'s absence very much, having no\nnews of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and\nthe progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get\nleave to visit Denisov in hospital.\n\nThe hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice\ndevastated by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when\nit is so beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a\nparticularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its\nfoul streets, tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken\nsoldiers wandering about.\n\nThe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window\nframes and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a\nwooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged\nsoldiers, with pale swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in\nthe sunshine in the yard.\n\nDirectly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of\nputrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army\ndoctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian\nassistant.\n\n\"I can\'t tear myself to pieces,\" the doctor was saying. \"Come to\nMakar Alexeevich in the evening. I shall be there.\"\n\nThe assistant asked some further questions.\n\n\"Oh, do the best you can! Isn\'t it all the same?\" The doctor noticed\nRostov coming upstairs.\n\n\"What do you want, sir?\" said the doctor. \"What do you want? The\nbullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a\npesthouse, sir.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Rostov.\n\n\"Typhus, sir. It\'s death to go in. Only we two, Makeev and I\" (he\npointed to the assistant), \"keep on here. Some five of us doctors have\ndied in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,\"\nsaid the doctor with evident satisfaction. \"Prussian doctors have been\ninvited here, but our allies don\'t like it at all.\"\n\nRostov explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the hussars,\nwho was wounded.\n\n\"I don\'t know. I can\'t tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in\ncharge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It\'s\nwell that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of\ncoffee and some lint each month or we should be lost!\" he laughed.\n\"Four hundred, sir, and they\'re always sending me fresh ones. There\nare four hundred? Eh?\" he asked, turning to the assistant.\n\nThe assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and\nimpatient for the talkative doctor to go.\n\n\"Major Denisov,\" Rostov said again. \"He was wounded at Molliten.\"\n\n\"Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makeev?\" queried the doctor, in a tone of\nindifference.\n\nThe assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor\'s words.\n\n\"Is he tall and with reddish hair?\" asked the doctor.\n\nRostov described Denisov\'s appearance.\n\n\"There was one like that,\" said the doctor, as if pleased. \"That one\nis dead, I fancy. However, I\'ll look up our list. We had a list.\nHave you got it, Makeev?\"\n\n\"Makar Alexeevich has the list,\" answered the assistant. \"But if\nyou\'ll step into the officers\' wards you\'ll see for yourself,\" he\nadded, turning to Rostov.\n\n\"Ah, you\'d better not go, sir,\" said the doctor, \"or you may have to\nstay here yourself.\"\n\nBut Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the\nassistant to show him the way.\n\n\"Only don\'t blame me!\" the doctor shouted up after him.\n\nRostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell\nwas so strong there that Rostov held his nose and had to pause and\ncollect his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the\nright, and an emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in\nunderclothing, limped out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked\nwith glittering envious eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at\nthe door, Rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor\non straw and overcoats.\n\n\"May I go in and look?\"\n\n\"What is there to see?\" said the assistant.\n\nBut, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,\nRostov entered the soldiers\' ward. The foul air, to which he had\nalready begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It\nwas a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where\nit originated.\n\nIn the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large\nwindows, the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to\nthe walls, and leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were\nunconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were\nconscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all\nlooked intently at Rostov with the same expression of hope, of relief,\nreproach, and envy of another\'s health. Rostov went to the middle of\nthe room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining\nrooms saw the same thing there. He stood still, looking silently\naround. He had not at all expected such a sight. Just before him,\nalmost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor, lay a\nsick man, probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair. The\nman lay on his back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. His face was\npurple, his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen,\nand on his bare legs and arms which were still red, the veins stood\nout like cords. He was knocking the back of his head against the\nfloor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating. Rostov\nlistened and made out the word. It was \"drink, drink, a drink!\" Rostov\nglanced round, looking for someone who would put this man back in\nhis place and bring him water.\n\n\"Who looks after the sick here?\" he asked the assistant.\n\nJust then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from\nthe next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rostov.\n\n\"Good day, your honor!\" he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostov and\nevidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.\n\n\"Get him to his place and give him some water,\" said Rostov,\npointing to the Cossack.\n\n\"Yes, your honor,\" the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his\neyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not\nmove.\n\n\"No, it\'s impossible to do anything here,\" thought Rostov,\nlowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an\nintense look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the\ncorner, on an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier\nas thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently\nfixed on Rostov. The man\'s neighbor on one side whispered something to\nhim, pointing at Rostov, who noticed that the old man wanted to\nspeak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg\nbent under him, the other had been amputated above the knee. His\nneighbor on the other side, who lay motionless some distance from\nhim with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with a snub nose.\nHis pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled\nback. Rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his\nback.\n\n\"Why, this one seems...\" he began, turning to the assistant.\n\n\"And how we\'ve been begging, your honor,\" said the old soldier,\nhis jaw quivering. \"He\'s been dead since morning. After all we\'re men,\nnot dogs.\"\n\n\"I\'ll send someone at once. He shall be taken away--taken away at\nonce,\" said the assistant hurriedly. \"Let us go, your honor.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, let us go,\" said Rostov hastily, and lowering his eyes\nand shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of\nreproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the\nroom.');

There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers\nwere lying or sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in\nhospital dressing gowns. The first person Rostov met in the\nofficers\' ward was a thin little man with one arm, who was walking\nabout the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with\na pipe between his teeth. Rostov looked at him, trying to remember\nwhere he had seen him before.\n\n\"See where we\'ve met again!\" said the little man. \"Tushin, Tushin,\ndon\'t you remember, who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern? And I\'ve had\na bit cut off, you see...\" he went on with a smile, pointing to the\nempty sleeve of his dressing gown. \"Looking for Vasili Dmitrich\nDenisov? My neighbor,\" he added, when he heard who Rostov wanted.\n\"Here, here,\" and Tushin led him into the next room, from whence\ncame sounds of several laughing voices.\n\n\"How can they laugh, or even live at all here?\" thought Rostov,\nstill aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong\nin the soldiers\' ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those\nenvious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face\nof that young soldier with eyes rolled back.\n\nDenisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket,\nthough it was nearly noon.\n\n\"Ah, Wostov? How are you, how are you?\" he called out, still in\nthe same voice as in the regiment, but Rostov noticed sadly that under\nthis habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling\nshowed itself in the expression of Denisov\'s face and the\nintonations of his voice.\n\nHis wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six\nweeks after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as\nthe faces of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that\nstruck Rostov. What struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to\nsee him, and smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the\nregiment, nor about the general state of affairs, and when Rostov\nspoke of these matters did not listen.\n\nRostov even noticed that Denisov did not like to be reminded of the\nregiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on\noutside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and was\nonly interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On\nRostov\'s inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from\nunder his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the\nrough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began\nreading his paper and specially drew Rostov\'s attention to the\nstinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions,\nwho had gathered round Rostov--a fresh arrival from the world\noutside--gradually began to disperse as soon as Denisov began reading\nhis answer. Rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had\nalready heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the\nman who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,\ngloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed Tushin\nstill listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the\nreading, the Uhlan interrupted Denisov.\n\n\"But what I say is,\" he said, turning to Rostov, \"it would be best\nsimply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will\nnow be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....\"\n\n\"Me petition the Empewo\'!\" exclaimed Denisov, in a voice to which he\ntried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like\nan expression of irritable impotence. \"What for? If I were a wobber\nI would ask mercy, but I\'m being court-martialed for bwinging\nwobbers to book. Let them twy me, I\'m not afwaid of anyone. I\'ve\nserved the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I\nto be degwaded?... Listen, I\'m w\'iting to them stwaight. This is\nwhat I say: \'If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...\'\"\n\n\"It\'s certainly well written,\" said Tushin, \"but that\'s not the\npoint, Vasili Dmitrich,\" and he also turned to Rostov. \"One has to\nsubmit, and Vasili Dmitrich doesn\'t want to. You know the auditor told\nyou it was a bad business.\"\n\n\"Well, let it be bad,\" said Denisov.\n\n\"The auditor wrote out a petition for you,\" continued Tushin, \"and\nyou ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he\"\n(indicating Rostov) \"has connections on the staff. You won\'t find a\nbetter opportunity.\"\n\n\"Haven\'t I said I\'m not going to gwovel?\" Denisov interrupted him,\nwent on reading his paper.\n\nRostov had not the courage to persuade Denisov, though he\ninstinctively felt that the way advised by Tushin and the other\nofficers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of\nservice to Denisov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward\nhasty temper.\n\nWhen the reading of Denisov\'s virulent reply, which took more than an\nhour, was over, Rostov said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day\nin a most dejected state of mind amid Denisov\'s hospital comrades, who\nhad gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to\ntheir stories. Denisov was moodily silent all the evening.\n\nLate in the evening, when Rostov was about to leave, he asked\nDenisov whether he had no commission for him.\n\n\"Yes, wait a bit,\" said Denisov, glancing round at the officers, and\ntaking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where\nhe had an inkpot, and sat down to write.\n\n\"It seems it\'s no use knocking one\'s head against a wall!\" he\nsaid, coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope. In it\nwas the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which\nDenisov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat\nofficials, simply asked for pardon.\n\n\"Hand it in.

Boris Drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom\nhe was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the\nstay at Tilsit.\n\n\"I should like to see the great man,\" he said, alluding to Napoleon,\nwhom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.\n\n\"You are speaking of Buonaparte?\" asked the general, smiling.\n\nBoris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that\nhe was being tested.\n\n\"I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,\" he replied. The\ngeneral patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.\n\n\"You will go far,\" he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.\n\nBoris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two\nEmperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon\npass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw\nthe pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a\ntavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon\'s arrival, saw both\nEmperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleon--reaching the raft\nfirst--stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand\nto him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had\nbegun to move in the highest circles Boris had made it his habit to\nwatch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At\nthe time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had\ncome with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened\nattentively to words spoken by important personages. At the moment the\nEmperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not\nforget to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview had\nlasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same\nevening, among other facts he felt to be of historic importance. As\nthe Emperor\'s suite was a very small one, it was a matter of great\nimportance, for a man who valued his success in the service, to be at\nTilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors, and\nhaving succeeded in this, Boris felt that henceforth his position was\nfully assured. He had not only become known, but people had grown\naccustomed to him and accepted him. Twice he had executed commissions\nto the Emperor himself, so that the latter knew his face, and all\nthose at court, far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they\nconsidered him a newcomer, would now have been surprised had he been\nabsent.\n\nBoris lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilinski.\nZhilinski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond\nof the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French\nofficers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and\nlunching with him and Boris.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinski\narranged a supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an\naide-de-camp of Napoleon\'s, there were also several French officers of\nthe Guard, and a page of Napoleon\'s, a young lad of an old\naristocratic French family. That same day, Rostov, profiting by the\ndarkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit\nand went to the lodging occupied by Boris and Zhilinski.\n\nRostov, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far\nfrom having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and\nthe French--who from being foes had suddenly become friends--that\nhad taken place at headquarters and in Boris. In the army, Bonaparte\nand the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger,\ncontempt, and fear. Only recently, talking with one of Platov\'s\nCossack officers, Rostov had argued that if Napoleon were taken\nprisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal.\nQuite lately, happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the\nroad, Rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible\nbetween a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rostov\nwas therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers\nin Boris\' lodging, dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see\nfrom quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank.\nAs soon as he noticed a French officer, who thrust his head out of the\ndoor, that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at\nthe sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He stopped at the\nthreshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there.\nBoris, hearing a strange voice in the anteroom, came out to meet\nhim. An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face\non first recognizing Rostov.\n\n\"Ah, it\'s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,\" he said, however,\ncoming toward him with a smile. But Rostov had noticed his first\nimpulse.\n\n\"I\'ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have\nbusiness,\" he said coldly.\n\n\"No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.\nDans un moment je suis a vous,\"* he said, answering someone who called\nhim.\n\n\n*\"In a minute I shall be at your disposal.\"\n\n\n\"I see I\'m intruding,\" Rostov repeated.\n\nThe look of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris\' face:\nhaving evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly\ntook both Rostov\'s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes,\nlooking serenely and steadily at Rostov, seemed to be veiled by\nsomething, as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it\nseemed to Rostov.\n\n\"Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!\" said Boris,\nand he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and\nintroduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian,\nbut an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.\n\n\"Count Zhilinski--le Comte N. N.--le Capitaine S. S.,\" said he,\nnaming his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed\nreluctantly, and remained silent.\n\nZhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very\nwillingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov. Boris did not\nappear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the\nsame pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with\nwhich he had met Rostov, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the\nFrenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,\naddressed the obstinately taciturn Rostov, saying that the latter\nhad probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.\n\n\"No, I came on business,\" replied Rostov, briefly.\n\nRostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look\nof dissatisfaction on Boris\' face, and as always happens to those in a\nbad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion\nand that he was in everybody\'s way. He really was in their way, for he\nalone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The\nlooks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: \"And what is he\nsitting here for?\" He rose and went up to Boris.\n\n\"Anyhow, I\'m in your way,\" he said in a low tone. \"Come and talk\nover my business and I\'ll go away.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not at all,\" said Boris. \"But if you are tired, come and\nlie down in my room and have a rest.\"\n\n\"Yes, really...\"\n\nThey went into the little room where Boris slept. Rostov, without\nsitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Boris were to blame in\nsome way) telling him about Denisov\'s affair, asking him whether,\nthrough his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor\non Denisov\'s behalf and get Denisov\'s petition handed in. When he\nand Boris were alone, Rostov felt for the first time that he could not\nlook Boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness. Boris, with one\nleg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender\nfingers of his right, listened to Rostov as a general listens to the\nreport of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight\ninto Rostov\'s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this\nhappened Rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.\n\n\"I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe\nin such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the\nEmperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in\ngeneral, I think...\"\n\n\"So you don\'t want to do anything? Well then, say so!\" Rostov almost\nshouted, not looking Boris in the face.\n\nBoris smiled.\n\n\"On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...\"\n\nAt that moment Zhilinski\'s voice was heard calling Boris.\n\n\"Well then, go, go, go...\" said Rostov, and refusing supper and\nremaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long\ntime, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.');

He could not himself go to the general in attendance\nas he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so,\nand Boris, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the\nfollowing day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were\nsigned. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the\nCross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of\nthe First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening,\ngiven by a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk\nbattalion. The Emperors were to be present at that banquet.\n\nRostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris that, when\nthe latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and\nearly next morning went away, avoiding Boris. In his civilian\nclothes and a round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the\nFrench and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the\nRussian and French Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables\nbeing set up and preparations made for the dinner; he saw the\nRussian and French colors draped from side to side of the streets,\nwith huge monograms A and N. In the windows of the houses also flags\nand bunting were displayed.\n\n\"Boris doesn\'t want to help me and I don\'t want to ask him. That\'s\nsettled,\" thought Nicholas. \"All is over between us, but I won\'t leave\nhere without having done all I can for Denisov and certainly not\nwithout getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is\nhere!\" thought Rostov, who had unconsciously returned to the house\nwhere Alexander lodged.\n\nSaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were\nassembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.\n\n\"I may see him at any moment,\" thought Rostov. \"If only I were to\nhand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really\narrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand\non whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows\neverything. Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even\nif they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?\" thought\nhe, looking at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor\noccupied. \"After all, people do go in.... It\'s all nonsense! I\'ll go\nin and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for\nDrubetskoy who drives me to it!\" And suddenly with a determination\nhe himself did not expect, Rostov felt for the letter in his pocket\nand went straight to the house.\n\n\"No, I won\'t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,\" he\nthought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious\nof the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. \"I will fall\nat his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will\neven thank me. \'I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice\nis the greatest happiness,\'\" Rostov fancied the sovereign saying.\nAnd passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the\nporch of the Emperor\'s house.\n\nA broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right\nhe saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading\nto the lower floor.\n\n\"Whom do you want?\" someone inquired.\n\n\"To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,\" said Nicholas,\nwith a tremor in his voice.\n\n\"A petition? This way, to the officer on duty\" (he was\nshown the door leading downstairs), \"only it won\'t be accepted.\"\n\nOn hearing this indifferent voice, Rostov grew frightened at what he\nwas doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so\nfascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run\naway, but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and\nRostov entered.\n\nA short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots\nand a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing\nin that room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his\nbreeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some\nreason, attracted Rostov\'s attention. This man was speaking to someone\nin the adjoining room.\n\n\"A good figure and in her first bloom,\" he was saying, but on seeing\nRostov, he stopped short and frowned.\n\n\"What is it? A petition?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the person in the other room.\n\n\"Another petitioner,\" answered the man with the braces.\n\n\"Tell him to come later. He\'ll be coming out directly, we must go.\"\n\n\"Later... later! Tomorrow. It\'s too late...\"\n\nRostov turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped\nhim.\n\n\"Whom have you come from? Who are you?\"\n\n\"I come from Major Denisov,\" answered Rostov.\n\n\"Are you an officer?\"\n\n\"Lieutenant Count Rostov.\"\n\n\"What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with\nyou... go,\" and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed\nhim.\n\nRostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there\nwere many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to\npass.\n\nCursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding\nhimself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to\nshame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety\nof his conduct and repenting of it, Rostov, with downcast eyes, was\nmaking his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a\nfamiliar voice called him and a hand detained him.\n\n\"What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?\" asked a deep\nvoice.\n\nIt was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor\'s special\nfavor during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the\ndivision in which Rostov was serving.\n\nRostov, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the\nkindly, jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an\nexcited voice told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for\nDenisov, whom the general knew. Having heard Rostov to the end, the\ngeneral shook his head gravely.\n\n\"I\'m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.\"\n\nHardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining\nDenisov\'s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were\nheard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the\nporch. The gentlemen of the Emperor\'s suite ran down the stairs and\nwent to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at\nAusterlitz, led up the Emperor\'s horse, and the faint creak of a\nfootstep Rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the\ndanger of being recognized, Rostov went close to the porch, together\nwith some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw those\nfeatures he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the\nsame union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm\nand love for his sovereign rose again in Rostov\'s soul in all its\nold force. In the uniform of the Preobrazhensk regiment--white\nchamois-leather breeches and high boots--and wearing a star Rostov did\nnot know (it was that of the Legion d\'honneur), the monarch came out\ninto the porch, putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his\narm. He stopped and looked about him, brightening everything around by\nhis glance. He spoke a few words to some of the generals, and,\nrecognizing the former commander of Rostov\'s division, smiled and\nbeckoned to him.\n\nAll the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general talking for\nsome time to the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his\nhorse. Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers\n(among whom was Rostov) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside\nhis horse, with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the\ncavalry general and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be\nheard by all:\n\n\"I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than\nI,\" and he raised his foot to the stirrup.\n\nThe general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and\nrode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm,\nRostov ran after him with the crowd.');

It\ncould be no one else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue\nuniform open over a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his\nshoulder. He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse\nwith a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. On approaching\nAlexander he raised his hat, and as he did so, Rostov, with his\ncavalryman\'s eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit\nwell or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted \"Hurrah!\" and\n\"Vive l\'Empereur!\" Napoleon said something to Alexander, and both\nEmperors dismounted and took each other\'s hands. Napoleon\'s face\nwore an unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying\nsomething affable to him.\n\nIn spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes\' horses, which\nwere pushing back the crowd, Rostov kept his eyes on every movement of\nAlexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander\ntreated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease\nwith the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday\nmatter to him.\n\nAlexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites,\napproached the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and came\nstraight up to the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly\nfound itself so close to the Emperors that Rostov, standing in the\nfront row, was afraid he might be recognized.\n\n\"Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the\nbravest of your soldiers,\" said a sharp, precise voice, articulating\nevery letter.\n\nThis was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into\nAlexander\'s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to\nhim and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,\"\nadded Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and\nassurance exasperating to Rostov, he ran his eyes over the Russian\nranks drawn up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes\nfixed on their Emperor.\n\n\"Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?\" said\nAlexander and took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlovski, the\ncommander of the battalion.\n\nBonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,\ntore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him\nrushed forward and picked it up.\n\n\"To whom shall it be given?\" the Emperor Alexander asked\nKoslovski, in Russian in a low voice.\n\n\"To whomever Your Majesty commands.\"\n\nThe Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing\nback, remarked:\n\n\"But we must give him an answer.\"\n\nKozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostov in his\nscrutiny.\n\n\"Can it be me?\" thought Rostov.\n\n\"Lazarev!\" the colonel called, with a frown, and Lazarev, the\nfirst soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.\n\n\"Where are you off to? Stop here!\" voices whispered to Lazarev who\ndid not know where to go. Lazarev stopped, casting a sidelong look\nat his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to\nsoldiers called before the ranks.\n\nNapoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out\nbehind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing\nat once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed\nsomething from one to another, and a page--the same one Rostov had\nseen the previous evening at Boris\'--ran forward and, bowing\nrespectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a\nmoment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without\nlooking, pressed two fingers together and the badge was between\nthem. Then he approached Lazarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently\ngazed at his own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to\nimply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally,\nand the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lazarev\'s\nbuttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his\nhand to deign to touch that soldier\'s breast for the soldier to be\nforever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone else in the\nworld. Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarev\'s breast and,\ndropping his hand, turned toward Alexander as though sure that the\ncross would adhere there. And it really did.\n\nOfficious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross\nand fastened it to the uniform. Lazarev glanced morosely at the little\nman with white hands who was doing something to him and, still\nstanding motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into\nAlexander\'s eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go\naway, or do something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for\nsome time in that rigid position.\n\nThe Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhensk battalion,\nbreaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the\ntables prepared for them.\n\nLazarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers\nembraced him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of\nofficers and civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of\nRussian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables\nin the square. Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and\nhappy, passed by Rostov.\n\n\"What d\'you think of the treat? All on silver plate,\" one of them\nwas saying. \"Have you seen Lazarev?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what luck for Lazarev! Twelve hundred francs\' pension\nfor life.\"\n\n\"Here\'s a cap, lads!\" shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier, donning a\nshaggy French cap.\n\n\"It\'s a fine thing! First-rate!\"\n\n\"Have you heard the password?\" asked one Guards\' officer of another.\n\"The day before yesterday it was \'Napoleon, France, bravoure\';\nyesterday, \'Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.\' One day our Emperor gives it\nand next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. George\'s\nCross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be done. He\nmust respond in kind.\"\n\nBoris, too, with his friend Zhilinski, came to see the Preobrazhensk\nbanquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostov standing by the corner\nof a house.\n\n\"Rostov! How d\'you do? We missed one another,\" he said, and could\nnot refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and\ntroubled was Rostov\'s face.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" replied Rostov.\n\n\"You\'ll call round?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will.\"\n\nRostov stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from\na distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on\nwhich he could not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in\nhis soul. Now he remembered Denisov with his changed expression, his\nsubmission, and the whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and\nits dirt and disease. So vividly did he recall that hospital stench of\ndead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from. Next\nhe thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white\nhand, who was now an Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then\nwhy those severed arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he\nthought of Lazarev rewarded and Denisov punished and unpardoned. He\ncaught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.\n\nThe smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of\nhunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to\neat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.\nThere he found so many people, among them officers who, like\nhimself, had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in\ngetting a dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The\nconversation naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his\ncomrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied with the peace\nconcluded after the battle of Friedland. They said that had we held\nout a little longer Napoleon would have been done for, as his troops\nhad neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly\nthe latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by\nhimself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without\nreaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet\ncould not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers\' saying\nthat it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov began shouting\nwith uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the\nofficers:\n\n\"How can you judge what\'s best?\" he cried, the blood suddenly rushing\nto his face. \"How can you judge the Emperor\'s actions? What right have\nwe to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor\'s aims or his\nactions!\"\n\n\"But I never said a word about the Emperor!\" said the officer,\njustifying himself, and unable to understand Rostov\'s outburst, except\non the supposition that he was drunk.\n\nBut Rostov did not listen to him.\n\n\"We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,\"\nhe went on. \"If we are ordered to die, we must die. If we\'re punished,\nit means that we have deserved it, it\'s not for us to judge. If the\nEmperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an\nalliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If\nonce we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred\nwill be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God--nothing!\"\nshouted Nicholas, banging the table--very little to the point as it\nseemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own\nthoughts.\n\n\"Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That\'s\nall....\" said he.\n\n\"And to drink,\" said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.\n\n\"Yes, and to drink,\" assented Nicholas. \"Hullo there! Another\nbottle!\" he shouted.\n\nIn 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview\nwith the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg\nthere was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.');

He was not\nthinking of anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from\nside to side.\n\nThey crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year\nbefore. They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and\ngreen fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near\nthe bridge, uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past\nstrips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there,\nand into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the\nforest it was almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with\ntheir sticky green leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers\nand the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last\nyear\'s leaves. The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees\nscattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant\nreminder of winter. On entering the forest the horses began to snort\nand sweated visibly.\n\nPeter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter\nassented. But apparently the coachman\'s sympathy was not enough for\nPeter, and he turned on the box toward his master.\n\n\"How pleasant it is, your excellency!\" he said with a respectful\nsmile.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It\'s pleasant, your excellency!\"\n\n\"What is he talking about?\" thought Prince Andrew. \"Oh, the\nspring, I suppose,\" he thought as he turned round. \"Yes, really\neverything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry\nand alders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah,\nhere is one oak!\"\n\n At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of\nthe birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and\ntwice as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as\ngreat as a man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its\nbranches had been broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge\nungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and\nfingers, it stood an aged, stern, and scornful monster among the\nsmiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about\nin the forest, and this oak, refused to yield to the charm of spring\nor notice either the spring or the sunshine.\n\n\"Spring, love, happiness!\" this oak seemed to say. \"Are you not\nweary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always\nthe same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness!\nLook at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too,\nsticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have\ngrown, whether from my back or my sides: as they have grown so I\nstand, and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies.\"\n\nAs he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times\nto look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,\ntoo, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling,\nrigid, misshapen, and grim as ever.\n\n\"Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,\" thought Prince\nAndrew. \"Let others--the young--yield afresh to that fraud, but we\nknow life, our life is finished!\"\n\nA whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully\npleasant, rose in his soul in connection with that tree. During this\njourney he, as it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at\nhis old conclusion, restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for\nhim to begin anything anew--but that he must live out his life,\ncontent to do no harm, and not disturbing himself or desiring\nanything.');

This Marshal was Count Ilya Rostov, and in the\nmiddle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him.\n\nIt was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already\nclothed in green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water\none longed to bathe.\n\nPrince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about\nwhich he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the\ngrounds of the Rostovs\' house at Otradnoe. He heard merry girlish\ncries behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to\ncross the path of his caleche. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran\na dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz\ndress, with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose\nlocks of hair escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing\nthat he was a stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.\n\nSuddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so\nbeautiful, the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim\npretty girl did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was\ncontented and cheerful in her own separate--probably foolish--but\nbright and happy life. \"What is she so glad about? What is she\nthinking of? Not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of\nthe Ryazan serfs\' quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so\nhappy?\" Prince Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.\n\nIn 1809 Count Ilya Rostov was living at Otradnoe just as he had done\nin former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province\nwith hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince\nAndrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his\nstaying the night.\n\nDuring the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by\nhis elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old\ncount\'s house was crowded on account of an approaching name day),\nPrince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Natasha, gay and laughing among\nthe younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, \"What\nis she thinking about? Why is she so glad?\"\n\nThat night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to\nsleep. He read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It\nwas hot in the room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He\nwas cross with the stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had\nmade him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not\nyet arrived from town, and he was vexed with himself for having\nstayed.\n\nHe got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened\nthe shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for\nthis, burst into the room. He opened the casement. The night was\nfresh, bright, and very still. Just before the window was a row of\npollard trees, looking black on one side and with a silvery light on\nthe other. Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush, wet, bushy\nvegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there. Farther\nback beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew, to the right was\na leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches, and above it\nshone the moon, nearly at its full, in a pale, almost starless, spring\nsky. Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his\neyes rested on that sky.\n\nHis room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were\nalso awake. He heard female voices overhead.\n\n\"Just once more,\" said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew\nrecognized at once.\n\n\"But when are you coming to bed?\" replied another voice.\n\n\"I won\'t, I can\'t sleep, what\'s the use? Come now for the last\ntime.\"\n\n Two girlish voices sang a musical passage--the end of some song.\n\n\"Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there\'s an end of it.\"\n\n\"You go to sleep, but I can\'t,\" said the first voice, coming\nnearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the\nrustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard.\nEverything was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the\nshadows. Prince Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his\nunintentional presence.\n\n\"Sonya! Sonya!\" he again heard the first speaker. \"Oh, how can you\nsleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,\nSonya!\" she said almost with tears in her voice. \"There never, never\nwas such a lovely night before!\"\n\nSonya made some reluctant reply.\n\n\"Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come\nhere.... Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like\nsitting down on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this,\nstraining tight, as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....\"\n\n\"Take care, you\'ll fall out.\"\n\nHe heard the sound of a scuffle and Sonya\'s disapproving voice:\n\"It\'s past one o\'clock.\"\n\n\"Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!\"\n\nAgain all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting\nthere. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.\n\n\"O God, O God! What does it mean?\" she suddenly exclaimed. \"To bed\nthen, if it must be!\" and she slammed the casement.\n\n\"For her I might as well not exist!\" thought Prince Andrew while\nhe listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that\nshe might say something about him. \"There she is again! As if it\nwere on purpose,\" thought he.\n\nIn his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of\nyouthful thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his\nlife, that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down\nand fell asleep at once.');

In the forest the\nharness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks\nbefore, for now all was thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs\ndotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but,\nlending themselves to the mood around, were delicately green with\nfluffy young shoots.\n\nThe whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but\nonly a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling\nthe road and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in\nthe shade, the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and\nscarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the\nnightingales trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now\nfar away.\n\n\"Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,\" thought\nPrince Andrew. \"But where is it?\" he again wondered, gazing at the\nleft side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with\nadmiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured,\nspreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and\nslightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled\nfingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in\nevidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were\nno twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old\nveteran could have produced.\n\n\"Yes, it is the same oak,\" thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he\nwas seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal.\nAll the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory.\nAusterlitz with the lofty heavens, his wife\'s dead reproachful face,\nPierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night,\nand that night itself and the moon, and.... all this rushed suddenly\nto his mind.\n\n\"No, life is not over at thirty-one!\" Prince Andrew suddenly decided\nfinally and decisively. \"It is not enough for me to know what I have\nin me--everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted\nto fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may\nnot be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it,\nbut so that it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live\nin harmony!\"\n\n\nOn reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that\nautumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole\nseries of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be\nessential for him to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the\nservice, kept springing up in his mind. He could not now understand\nhow he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an\nactive share in life, just as a month before he had not understood how\nthe idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head. It\nnow seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be\nsenselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again\nplayed an active part in life. He did not even remember how\nformerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments, it\nhad seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now, after\nthe lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe in the\npossibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or\nlove. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey to\nRyazan he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer\ninterested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,\nwent to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he\nwould turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled\na la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame.\nShe did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked\nsimply, merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing\nhis arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling,\nas he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as\na crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with\nPierre, with fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman\'s\nbeauty and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he\nwas particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.\n\n\"My dear,\" Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say,\n\"little Nicholas can\'t go out today, it\'s very cold.\"\n\n\"If it were hot,\" Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly\nto his sister, \"he could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he\nmust wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That\nis what follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child\nwho needs fresh air should remain at home,\" he would add with\nextreme logic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical\nemotions that stirred within him.\n\nAt such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work\ndries men up.');

It was the time\nwhen the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his\nreforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That\nsame August the Emperor was thrown from his caleche, injured his\nleg, and remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving Speranski every\nday and no one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being\nprepared that so agitated society--abolishing court ranks and\nintroducing examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate\nAssessor and State Councilor--and not merely these but a whole state\nconstitution, intended to change the existing order of government in\nRussia: legal, administrative, and financial, from the Council of\nState down to the district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams\nwith which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he\nhad tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates,\nCzartoryski, Novosiltsev, Kochubey, and Strogonov--whom he himself\nin jest had called his Comite de salut public--were taking shape and\nbeing realized.\n\nNow all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil side,\nand Arakcheev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew,\nas a gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a\nlevee. The Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with\na single word. It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he\nwas antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his\nface and personality generally, and in the cold, repellent glance\nthe Emperor gave him, he now found further confirmation of this\nsurmise. The courtiers explained the Emperor\'s neglect of him by His\nMajesty\'s displeasure at Bolkonski\'s not having served since 1805.\n\n\"I know myself that one cannot help one\'s sympathies and\nantipathies,\" thought Prince Andrew, \"so it will not do to present\nmy proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor\npersonally, but the project will speak for itself.\"\n\nHe mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend\nof his father\'s. The field marshal made an appointment to see him,\nreceived him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few\ndays later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see\nthe Minister of War, Count Arakcheev.\n\n\nOn the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev\'s waiting\nroom at nine in the morning.\n\nHe did not know Arakcheev personally, had never seen him, and all he\nhad heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.\n\n\"He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not\nconcern myself about his personal qualities: he has been\ncommissioned to consider my project, so he alone can get it\nadopted,\" thought Prince Andrew as he waited among a number of\nimportant and unimportant people in Count Arakcheev\'s waiting room.\n\nDuring his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen\nthe anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such\nrooms were well known to him. Count Arakcheev\'s anteroom had quite a\nspecial character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting\ntheir turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the\nfaces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of\nawkwardness, covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of\nthemselves, their situation, and the person for whom they were\nwaiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others whispered and\nlaughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname \"Sila Andreevich\" and the\nwords, \"Uncle will give it to us hot,\" in reference to Count\nArakcheev. One general (an important personage), evidently feeling\noffended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing his\nlegs and smiling contemptuously to himself.\n\nBut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all\nfaces--that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the\nadjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look\nand was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others\nhad been shown in and out of the minister\'s room by the adjutant on\nduty, an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and\nfrightened air was admitted at that terrible door. This officer\'s\naudience lasted a long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a\nharsh voice was heard from the other side of the door, and the\nofficer--with pale face and trembling lips--came out and passed\nthrough the waiting room, clutching his head.\n\nAfter this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer\non duty said in a whisper, \"To the right, at the window.\"\n\nPrince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man\nof forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep\nwrinkles, scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an\noverhanging red nose. Arakcheev turned his head toward him without\nlooking at him.\n\n\"What is your petition?\" asked Arakcheev.\n\n\"I am not petitioning, your excellency,\" returned Prince Andrew\nquietly.\n\nArakcheev\'s eyes turned toward him.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said he. \"Prince Bolkonski?\"\n\n\"I am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has\ndeigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me...\"\n\n\"You see, my dear sir, I have read your project,\" interrupted\nArakcheev, uttering only the first words amiably and then--again\nwithout looking at Prince Andrew--relapsing gradually into a tone of\ngrumbling contempt. \"You are proposing new military laws? There are\nmany laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody\ndesigns laws, it is easier writing than doing.\"\n\n\"I came at His Majesty the Emperor\'s wish to learn from your\nexcellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have\npresented,\" said Prince Andrew politely.\n\n\"I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to\nthe committee. I do not approve of it,\" said Arakcheev, rising and\ntaking a paper from his writing table. \"Here!\" and he handed it to\nPrince Andrew.\n\nAcross the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,\nmisspelled, and without punctuation: \"Unsoundly constructed because\nresembles an imitation of the French military code and from the\nArticles of War needlessly deviating.\"\n\n\"To what committee has the memorandum been referred?\" inquired\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\"To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that\nyour honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.\"\n\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\n\"I don\'t want one.\"\n\n\"A member without salary,\" repeated Arakcheev. \"I have the\nhonor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?\" he shouted, bowing\nto Prince Andrew.');

From the irritation of the\nolder men, the curiosity of the uninitiated, the reserve of the\ninitiated, the hurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the\ninnumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned\nevery day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast\ncivil conflict was in preparation, the commander in chief of which was\na mysterious person he did not know, but who was supposed to be a\nman of genius--Speranski. And this movement of reconstruction of which\nPrince Andrew had a vague idea, and Speranski its chief promoter,\nbegan to interest him so keenly that the question of the army\nregulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness.\n\nPrince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception\nin the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The\nreforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place\nbecause he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly\nbecause by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of\nbeing a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured\nthe innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy in their\ndisapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the son of his\nfather. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because he was\nrich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a\nhalo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss\nof his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him\npreviously was that he had greatly improved during these last five\nyears, having softened and grown more manly, lost his former\naffectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and acquired the\nserenity that comes with years. People talked about him, were\ninterested in him, and wanted to meet him.\n\nThe day after his interview with Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrew\nspent the evening at Count Kochubey\'s. He told the count of his\ninterview with Sila Andreevich (Kochubey spoke of Arakcheev by that\nnickname with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the\nMinister of War\'s anteroom).\n\n\"Mon cher, even in this case you can\'t do without Michael\nMikhaylovich Speranski. He manages everything. I\'ll speak to him. He\nhas promised to come this evening.\"\n\n\"What has Speranski to do with the army regulations?\" asked Prince\nAndrew.\n\nKochubey shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolkonski\'s\nsimplicity.\n\n\"We were talking to him about you a few days ago,\" Kochubey\ncontinued, \"and about your freed plowmen.\"\n\n\"Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?\" said an old\nman of Catherine\'s day, turning contemptuously toward Bolkonski.\n\n\"It was a small estate that brought in no profit,\" replied Prince\nAndrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old\nman uselessly.\n\n\"Afraid of being late...\" said the old man, looking at Kochubey.\n\n\"There\'s one thing I don\'t understand,\" he continued. \"Who will plow\nthe land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but difficult\nto rule.... Just the same as now--I ask you, Count--who will be\nheads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?\"\n\n\"Those who pass the examinations, I suppose,\" replied Kochubey,\ncrossing his legs and glancing round.\n\n\"Well, I have Pryanichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a\npriceless man, but he\'s sixty. Is he to go up for examination?\"\n\n\"Yes, that\'s a difficulty, as education is not at all general,\nbut...\"\n\nCount Kochubey did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the\narm, and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a\nlarge open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness,\nwho was just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with\na cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It\nwas Speranski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a\nthrob within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it\nwas from respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know.\nSperanski\'s whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily\nrecognizable. In the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never\nseen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed\nsuch calmness and self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet\ngentle an expression as that in those half-closed, rather humid\neyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; nor had he heard such\na refined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such\ndelicate whiteness of face or hands--hands which were broad, but\nvery plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew\nhad only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in\nhospital. This was Speranski, Secretary of State, reporter to the\nEmperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he had more than once met\nand talked with Napoleon.\n\nSperanski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as\npeople involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no\nhurry to speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be\nlistened to, and he looked only at the person with whom he was\nconversing.\n\nPrince Andrew followed Speranski\'s every word and movement with\nparticular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men who\njudge those near to them severely, he always on meeting anyone\nnew--especially anyone whom, like Speranski, he knew by\nreputation--expected to discover in him the perfection of human\nqualities.\n\nSperanski told Kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come\nsooner as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that\nthe Emperor had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation\nof modesty. When Kochubey introduced Prince Andrew, Speranski slowly\nturned his eyes to Bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at\nhim in silence.\n\n\"I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as\neveryone has,\" he said after a pause.\n\nKochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given\nBolkonski. Speranski smiled more markedly.\n\n\"The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend\nMonsieur Magnitski,\" he said, fully articulating every word and\nsyllable, \"and if you like I can put you in touch with him.\" He paused\nat the full stop. \"I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to\nco-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.\"\n\nA circle soon formed round Speranski, and the old man who had talked\nabout his subordinate Pryanichnikov addressed a question to him.\n\nPrince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every\nmovement of Speranski\'s: this man, not long since an insignificant\ndivinity student, who now, Bolkonski thought, held in his hands--those\nplump white hands--the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the\nextraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speranski answered the\nold man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an\nimmeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,\nSperanski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or\ndisadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.\n\nHaving talked for a little while in the general circle, Speranski\nrose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of\nthe room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest\nhimself in Bolkonski.\n\n\"I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated\nconversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\" he said\nwith a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile\nthat he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the\npeople with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince\nAndrew. \"I have known of you for a long time: first from your action\nwith regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very\ndesirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because\nyou are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not\nconsidered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the\nranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and\ntittle-tattle.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Prince Andrew, \"my father did not wish me to take\nadvantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.\"\n\n\"Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above\nour contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely\nreestablishes natural justice.\"\n\n\"I think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,\"\nreturned Prince Andrew, trying to resist Speranski\'s influence, of\nwhich he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in\neverything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke\neasily and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now\nwhile talking with Speranski. He was too much absorbed in observing\nthe famous man\'s personality.\n\n\"Grounds of personal ambition maybe,\" Speranski put in quietly.\n\n\"And of state interest to some extent,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Speranski quietly, lowering his eyes.\n\n\"I am an admirer of Montesquieu,\" replied Prince Andrew, \"and his\nidea that le principe des monarchies est l\'honneur me parait\nincontestable. Certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me\nparaissent etre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.\"*\n\n\n*\"The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable.\nCertain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means\nof maintaining that sentiment.\"\n\n\nThe smile vanished from Speranski\'s white face, which was much\nimproved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew\'s thought interested\nhim.\n\n\"Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,\"* he began,\npronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower\nthan in Russian but quite calmly.\n\n\n*\"If you regard the question from that point of view.\"\n\n\nSperanski went on to say that honor, l\'honeur, cannot be upheld by\nprivileges harmful to the service; that honor, l\'honneur, is either\na negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a\nsource of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which\nrecognize it. His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.\n\n\"An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one\nsimilar to the Legion d\'honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not\nharmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class\nor court privilege.\"\n\n\"I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court\nprivileges have attained the same end,\" returned Prince Andrew. \"Every\ncourtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.\"\n\n\"Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,\"\nsaid Speranski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably\nan argument which was embarrassing for his companion. \"If you will\ndo me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,\" he added, \"I will,\nafter talking with Magnitski, let you know what may interest you,\nand shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.\"\n\nClosing his eyes, he bowed a la francaise, without taking leave, and\ntrying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.');

The\nmechanism of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time\neverywhere, absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did\nnothing, did not even think or find time to think, but only talked,\nand talked successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.\n\nHe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the\nsame remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy\nfor whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was\nthinking of nothing.\n\nAs he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey\'s, Speranski\nproduced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when\nhe received him tete-a-tate at his own house and talked to him long\nand confidentially.\n\nTo Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant\ncreatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of\nthat perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that\nin Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and\nvirtuous man. Had Speranski sprung from the same class as himself and\npossessed the same breeding and traditions, Bolkonski would soon have\ndiscovered his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speranski\'s\nstrange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the\nmore because he did not quite understand him. Moreover, Speranski,\neither because he appreciated the other\'s capacity or because he\nconsidered it necessary to win him to his side, showed off his\ndispassionate calm reasonableness before Prince Andrew and flattered\nhim with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with\nself-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one\'s companion\nis the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of\nthe rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one\'s own\nideas.\n\nDuring their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speranski\nmore than once remarked: \"We regard everything that is above the\ncommon level of rooted custom...\" or, with a smile: \"But we want the\nwolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe...\" or: \"They cannot\nunderstand this...\" and all in a way that seemed to say: \"We, you\nand I, understand what they are and who we are.\"\n\nThis first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened in\nPrince Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first\nmeeting. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast\nintellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power,\nwhich he was using solely for the welfare of Russia. In Prince\nAndrew\'s eyes Speranski was the man he would himself have wished to\nbe--one who explained all the facts of life reasonably, considered\nimportant only what was rational, and was capable of applying the\nstandard of reason to everything. Everything seemed so simple and\nclear in Speranski\'s exposition that Prince Andrew involuntarily\nagreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued, it was\nonly because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit\nto Speranski\'s opinions entirely. Everything was right and\neverything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince\nAndrew. This was Speranski\'s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not\nallow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands,\nwhich Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the\nhands of those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those\ndelicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was\nunpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he\nobserved in Speranski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he\nused to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental\ndevice, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince\nAndrew, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a\npractical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and\nlaugh ironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or\nsuddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one\nhe very frequently employed.) He would transfer a question to\nmetaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time, and\nthought, and, having deduced the refutation he needed, would again\ndescend to the level of the original discussion.\n\nIn general the trait of Speranski\'s mentality which struck Prince\nAndrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and\nauthority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur\nto him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is\nafter all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had\nnever felt the doubt, \"Is not all I think and believe nonsense?\" And\nit was just this peculiarity of Speranski\'s mind that particularly\nattracted Prince Andrew.\n\nDuring the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt a\npassionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt\nfor Bonaparte. The fact that Speranski was the son of a village\npriest, and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account\nof his humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to\ncherish his sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to\nstrengthen it.\n\nOn that first evening Bolkonski spent with him, having mentioned the\nCommission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speranski told him\nsarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and\nfifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that\nRosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the\ndifferent codes.\n\n\"And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,\"\nsaid he. \"We want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have\nno laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to\nserve in these times!\"\n\nPrince Andrew said that for that work an education in\njurisprudence was needed which he did not possess.\n\n\"But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious\ncircle from which we must break a way out.\"\n\nA week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army\nRegulations and--what he had not at all expected--was chairman of a\nsection of the committee for the revision of the laws. At\nSperanski\'s request he took the first part of the Civil Code that\nwas being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the\nInstitutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section on\nPersonal Rights.');

He\narranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members,\nand busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic\ncharters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented\nas far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the\nmajority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported almost\nsinglehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg.\n\nHis life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations\nand dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he\nconsidered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations\nof the bachelor circles in which he moved.\n\nAmid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre\nat the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to\nrest upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under\nhim. At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under\nhim the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had\njoined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who\nconfidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his\nfoot down it sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground,\nhe put his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in\nit, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.\n\nJoseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg--he had of late stood\naside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost\nentirely in Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew\nin ordinary life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely\nas Brothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Ivan Vasilevich D.,\nwhom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under\nthe Masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at\nwhich they aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and\nreckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in\npromises from a dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay\nas himself, Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother\npromised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on\nwhich he tried not to dwell arose in his soul.\n\nHe divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first\nhe put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the\nlodges or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the\nmystical science of the order: with questions of the threefold\ndesignation of God, the three primordial elements--sulphur, mercury,\nand salt--or the meaning of the square and all the various figures\nof the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to\nwhich the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought,\nJoseph Alexeevich himself, but he did not share their interests. His\nheart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.\n\nIn the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like\nhim, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a\nstraight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.\n\nIn the third category he included those Brothers (the majority)\nwho saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and\nceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without\ntroubling about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and\neven the Grand Master of the principal lodge.\n\nFinally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,\nparticularly those who had lately joined. These according to\nPierre\'s observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor\ndesire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate\nwith the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their\nconnections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.\n\nPierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing.\nFreemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him\nbased merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry\nitself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path\nand deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end of\nthe year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the\norder.\n\nIn the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our\nFreemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov\nhad obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons, had been\ninitiated into many mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade,\nand was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the\nadvantage of the Masonic cause in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons\nall came to see him, tried to ingratiate themselves with him, and it\nseemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and\nconcealing it.\n\nA solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened,\nat which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers\nwhat he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their\norder. The meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre\nrose and began his address.\n\n\"Dear Brothers,\" he began, blushing and stammering, with a written\nspeech in his hand, \"it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries\nin the seclusion of our lodge--we must act--act! We are drowsing,\nbut we must act.\" Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.\n\n\"For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of\nvirtue,\" he read, \"we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse\nprinciples in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the\neducation of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the\nwisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity,\nand folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by\nunity of purpose and possessed of authority and power.\n\n\"To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over\nvice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this\nworld, receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great\nendeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of\ntoday. What is to be done in these circumstances? To favor\nrevolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?... No! We are\nvery far from that. Every violent reform deserves censure, for it\nquite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, and also\nbecause wisdom needs no violence.\n\n\"The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of\npreparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of\nconviction--aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and\npatronizing talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and\nattaching them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the\npower unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder\nand to control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we\nmust found a form of government holding universal sway, which should\nbe diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of\ncitizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue in\ntheir customary course and do everything except what impedes the great\naim of our order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice.\nThis aim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and\ngood and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction\nof the best and wisest men.\n\n\"At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching\nalone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her\nwith special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods.\nIt is now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in\nvirtue a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate\nthe passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it\nis therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his\npassions within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means\nto that end.\n\n\"As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,\neach of them again training two others and all being closely united,\neverything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret\naccomplished much for the welfare of mankind.\"\n\nThis speech not only made a strong impression, but created\nexcitement in the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it\ndangerous designs of Illuminism,* met it with a coldness that\nsurprised Pierre. The Grand Master began answering him, and Pierre\nbegan developing his views with more and more warmth. It was long\nsince there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties were formed, some\naccusing Pierre of Illuminism, others supporting him. At that\nmeeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of\nmen\'s minds, which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself\nidentically to two persons. Even those members who seemed to be on his\nside understood him in their own way with limitations and\nalterations he could not agree to, as what he always wanted most was\nto convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it.\n\n\n*The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical\ninstitutions.\n\n\nAt the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will\nreproved Bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue\nalone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.\nPierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would\nbe accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for\nthe usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.');

For\nthree days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a\nsofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere.\n\nIt was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who\nimplored him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and\nhow she wished to devote her whole life to him.\n\nAt the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she\nwould return to Petersburg from abroad.\n\nFollowing this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre\nrespected less than the others forced his way in to see him and,\nturning the conversation upon Pierre\'s matrimonial affairs, by way\nof fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his\nwife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of\nFreemasonry by not forgiving the penitent.\n\nAt the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasili\'s wife, sent to\nhim imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a\nmost important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy\nagainst him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and\nin the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him.\nNothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much\nimportance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed\nhim he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his\nwife.\n\n\"No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to\nblame,\" he thought.\n\nIf he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife,\nit was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to\ntake any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned\nher away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of\nindifference whether he lived with his wife or not?\n\nWithout replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre\nlate one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see\nJoseph Alexeevich. This is what he noted in his diary:\n\n\nMoscow, 17th November\n\nI have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I\nhave experienced. Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three\nyears been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has\never heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till\nlate at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working at\nscience. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on\nwhich he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of\nJerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild\nsmile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.\nI told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed\nto our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of\nmy rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alexeevich, having remained silent\nand thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which\nat once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.\nHe surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the\norder: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The\npurification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The\nimprovement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which\nis the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and\nself-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently\nof circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the\ngreatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of\nthis aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our\nimpurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of the\nhuman race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and\nprofligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is\nattracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground\nJoseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the\ndepth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said\nto me, \"the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in\nperfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties\nof our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary, my\ndear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain\nour three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge--for man can only know himself\nby comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by\nconflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue--love of death.\nOnly the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our\ninnate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.\" These words are all\nthe more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,\nJoseph Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death, for\nwhich--in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man--he does\nnot yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained\nto me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out\nto me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He\nadvised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to\ntake up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting\nthe Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path\nself-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for\nmyself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end\nhe gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will\nin future note down all my actions.\n\n\nPetersburg, 23rd November\n\nI am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears\nand said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her;\nthat she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I\nknew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to\ngo on refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know\nwhose aid and advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would\nhave told me what to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph\nAlexeevich\'s letters and recalled my conversations with him, and\ndeduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a suppliant, and\nought to reach a helping hand to everyone--especially to one so\nclosely bound to me--and that I must bear my cross. But if I forgive\nher for the sake of doing right, then let union with her have only a\nspiritual aim. That is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph\nAlexeevich. I told my wife that I begged her to forget the past, to\nforgive me whatever wrong I may have done her, and that I had\nnothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need not know\nhow hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on the upper\nfloor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of\nregeneration.');

The largest of these was the French\ncircle of the Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumyantsev\nand Caulaincourt. In this group Helene, as soon as she had settled\nin Petersburg with her husband, took a very prominent place. She was\nvisited by the members of the French embassy and by many belonging\nto that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners.\n\nHelene had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the\nEmperors and had brought from there these connections with the\nNapoleonic notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant.\nNapoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her:\n\"C\'est un superbe animal.\"* Her success as a beautiful and elegant\nwoman did not surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer\nthan before. What did surprise him was that during these last two\nyears his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation \"d\' une femme\ncharmante, aussi spirituelle que belle.\"*[2] The distinguished\nPrince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. Bilibin saved up his\nepigrams to produce them in Countess Bezukhova\'s presence. To be\nreceived in the Countess Bezukhova\'s salon was regarded as a diploma\nof intellect. Young men read books before attending Helene\'s evenings,\nto have something to say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy,\nand even ambassadors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a\nway Helene was a power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid,\nsometimes attended, with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her\nevenings and dinner parties, where politics, poetry, and philosophy\nwere discussed. At these parties his feelings were like those of a\nconjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment.\nBut whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a\nsalon, or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the\ndeception, at any rate it remained unexposed and Helene Bezukhova\'s\nreputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established\nthat she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody\nwould go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound\nmeaning in it of which she herself had no conception.\n\n\n*\"That\'s a superb animal.\"\n\n*[2] \"Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.\"\n\n\nPierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He\nwas that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no\none\'s way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general\nimpression of the drawing room, he served, by the contrast he\npresented to her, as an advantageous background to his elegant and\ntactful wife. Pierre during the last two years, as a result of his\ncontinual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt\nfor all else, had acquired in his wife\'s circle, which did not\ninterest him, that air of unconcern, indifference, and benevolence\ntoward all, which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore\ninspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife\'s drawing room as\none enters a theater, was acquainted with everybody, equally pleased\nto see everyone, and equally indifferent to them all. Sometimes he\njoined in a conversation which interested him and, regardless of\nwhether any \"gentlemen of the embassy\" were present or not,\nlispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not at all in\naccord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general opinion\nconcerning the queer husband of \"the most distinguished woman in\nPetersburg\" was so well established that no one took his freaks\nseriously.\n\nAmong the many young men who frequented her house every day, Boris\nDrubetskoy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was\nthe most intimate friend of the Bezukhov household since Helene\'s\nreturn from Erfurt. Helene spoke of him as \"mon page\" and treated\nhim like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody, but\nsometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Boris\nbehaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade of\ndeference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three\nyears before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected\nhim that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition,\nfirst by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing\nhimself to suspect.\n\n\"No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally\nrenounced her former infatuations,\" he told himself. \"There has\nnever been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs\nof the heart\"--a statement which, though gathered from an unknown\nsource, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Boris\' presence\nin his wife\'s drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a\nphysical effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed\nthe unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.\n\n\"What a strange antipathy,\" thought Pierre, \"yet I used to like\nhim very much.\"\n\nIn the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather\nblind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who\ndid nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured\nfellow.

I ate and\ndrank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the\nBrothers. In the evening I went down to the countess and told a\nfunny story about B., and only remembered that I ought not to have\ndone so when everybody laughed loudly at it.\n\nI am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me\nto walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and\ndeliberation, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion,\n(3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the\nstate, (b) family duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the\nmanagement of my affairs.\n\n\n27th November\n\nI got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,\nhelp and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the\nScriptures, but without proper feeling. Brother Urusov came and we\ntalked about worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor\'s new\nprojects. I began to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my\nbenefactor\'s words--that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker\nfor the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not\ncalled on to assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O.\nvisited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a\nnew Brother. They laid on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak\nand unworthy. Then our talk turned to the interpretation of the\nseven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven sciences, the seven\nvirtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.\nBrother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the admission took place.\nThe new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the\nmagnificence of the spectacle. It was Boris Drubetskoy who was\nadmitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange feeling\nagitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber. I\ncaught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I\nvainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like to save him\nfrom evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of\nhim did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in entering\nthe Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of\nour lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several times\nwhether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I\ncould not reply) and that according to my observation he is\nincapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied\nand satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I\nhad no cause to doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all\nthe time I stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me\nthat he was smiling contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to\nstab his bare breast with the sword I held to it. I could not be\neloquent, nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to\nthe Grand Master. Great Architect of Nature, help me to find the\ntrue path out of the labyrinth of lies!\n\n\n After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then\nthe following was written:\n\n\nI have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who\nadvised me to hold fast by brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was\nrevealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim\nis the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name\nunutterable which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen,\nrefresh, and support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt\nhas no place. The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane\nscience and our sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human\nsciences dissect everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to\nexamine it. In the holy science of our order all is one, all is\nknown in its entirety and life. The Trinity--the three elements of\nmatter--are sulphur, mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and\nfiery nature; in combination with salt by its fiery nature it\narouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts\nmercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination produces other\nbodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence. Christ, the\nHoly Spirit, Him!...\n\n\n3rd December\n\nAwoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went\nand paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but\ninstead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago,\nwhen Dolokhov, meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I\nwas enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife\'s absence. At\nthe time I gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that\nmeeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter\nreplies. I recollected myself and drove away that thought only when\nI found myself glowing with anger, but I did not sufficiently\nrepent. Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy came and began relating various\nadventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I said something\ndisagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much that was\nunpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I recollected\nmyself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with him\nat all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so\nbecome much worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on\nthe contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his\npresence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave so that he too\nmay benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I\nclearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, \"Thy day!\"\n\nI dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded\nby dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my\nleft thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it\nwith my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger\none, began biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the\nbigger and heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking\nmy arm, led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a\nnarrow plank. I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to\nclamber up a fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After\nmuch effort I dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one\nside and my body on the other. I looked round and saw Brother A.\nstanding on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden,\nand in the garden was a large and beautiful building. I woke up. O\nLord, great Architect of Nature, help me to tear from myself these\ndogs--my passions especially the last, which unites in itself the\nstrength of all the former ones, and aid me to enter that temple of\nvirtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream.\n\n\n7th December\n\nI dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house, and that I\nwas very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered\nincessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this\ncould not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace\nhim. But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and\ngrown young, and he was quietly telling me something about the\nteaching of our order, but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it\nseemed that we all left the room and something strange happened. We\nwere sitting or lying on the floor. He was telling me something, and I\nwished to show him my sensibility, and not listening to what he was\nsaying I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and\nthe grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and I\nwas glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation and jumped\nup, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he\nhad been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a\nkind look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where\nthere is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with\nlonging to caress him and lie down too. And he said, \"Tell me\nfrankly what is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think you\nknow it already.\" Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was\nmy chief temptation. He shook his head incredulously; and even more\nabashed, I said that though I was living with my wife as he advised, I\nwas not living with her as her husband. To this he replied that one\nshould not deprive a wife of one\'s embraces and gave me to\nunderstand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should be\nashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and\nfound in my mind the text from the Gospel: \"The life was the light\nof men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness\ncomprehended it not.\" Joseph Alexeevich\'s face had looked young and\nbright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he\nwrote about \"conjugal duties.\"\n\n\n9th December\n\nI had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw\nthat I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and\nJoseph Alexeevich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at\nonce that the process of regeneration had already taken place in\nhim, and I rushed to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands,\nand he said, \"Hast thou noticed that my face is different?\" I looked\nat him, still holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young,\nbut that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite\nchanged. And I said, \"I should have known you had I met you by\nchance,\" and I thought to myself, \"Am I telling the truth?\" And\nsuddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered\nand went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of\ndrawing paper; I said, \"I drew that,\" and he answered by bowing his\nhead. I opened the book, and on all the pages there were excellent\ndrawings. And in my dream I knew that these drawings represented the\nlove adventures of the soul with its beloved. And on its pages I saw a\nbeautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and\nwith a transparent body, flying up to the clouds. And I seemed to know\nthat this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the Song of\nSongs. And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt that I was doing\nwrong, but could not tear myself away from them. Lord, help me! My\nGod, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but if I am\nmyself the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall perish of my\ndebauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!');

The only resource obviously\npresenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official\npost, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he\nsaid, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time.\n\nSoon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vera and was\naccepted.\n\nThough in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society without\nthemselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of\nacquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they\nwere provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow\nwithout inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.\n\nThe Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in\nMoscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country\nneighbors from Otradnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,\nPeronskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bezukhov, and the son of their\ndistrict postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the\nmen who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostovs\' house in\nPetersburg were Boris, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and\ndragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostovs\'\nand paid the eldest daughter, Countess Vera, the attentions a young\nman pays when he intends to propose.\n\nNot in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at\nAusterlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He\nnarrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air\nthat everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he\nhad obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.\n\nIn the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had\npicked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp\nstanding near the commander in chief and had taken it to his\ncommander. Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this\noccurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again\nbelieved it had been necessary to do this, and he received two\ndecorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in\nthe Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in\nPetersburg.\n\nThough some skeptics smiled when told of Berg\'s merits, it could not\nbe denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent\nterms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant\ncareer before him and an assured position in society.\n\nFour years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a\nMoscow theater, Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him and had\nsaid in German, \"das soll mein Weib werden,\"* and from that moment had\nmade up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered\nthe Rostovs\' position and his own, he decided that the time had come\nto propose.\n\n\n*\"That girl shall be my wife.\"\n\n\nBerg\'s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not\nflattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an\nobscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess\nRostova; but Berg\'s chief characteristic was such a naive and good\nnatured egotism that the Rostovs involuntarily came to think it\nwould be a good thing, since he himself was so firmly convinced that\nit was good, indeed excellent. Moreover, the Rostovs\' affairs were\nseriously embarrassed, as the suitor could not but know; and above\nall, Vera was twenty-four, had been taken out everywhere, and though\nshe was certainly good-looking and sensible, no one up to now had\nproposed to her. So they gave their consent.\n\n\"You see,\" said Berg to his comrade, whom he called \"friend\" only\nbecause he knew that everyone has friends, \"you see, I have considered\nit all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if\nit were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and\nmamma are now provided for--I have arranged that rent for them in\nthe Baltic Provinces--and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with\nher fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not\nmarrying for money--I consider that dishonorable--but a wife should\nbring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the\nservice, she has connections and some means. In our times that is\nworth something, isn\'t it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable\ngirl, and she loves me...\"\n\nBerg blushed and smiled.\n\n\"And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.\nNow the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite\ndifferent--an unpleasant character and has not the same\nintelligence. She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my\nfiancee!... Well, you will be coming,\" he was going to say, \"to dine,\"\nbut changed his mind and said \"to take tea with us,\" and quickly\ndoubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke,\nperfectly embodying his dream of happiness.\n\nAfter the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by\nBerg\'s proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times\ntook possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and\ninsincere. In the family\'s feeling toward this wedding a certain\nawkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not\nhaving loved Vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off\ntheir hands. The old count felt this most. He would probably have been\nunable to state the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from\nthe state of his affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what\nhis debts amounted to, or what dowry he could give Vera. When his\ndaughters were born he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an\nestate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had\nalready been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so\nmuch in arrears that it would have to be sold, so that it was\nimpossible to give it to Vera. Nor had he any money.\n\nBerg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained\nbefore the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own\nmind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At\none time the count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of\nselling a forest, at another time of borrowing money on a note of\nhand. A few days before the wedding Berg entered the count\'s study\nearly one morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his\nfuture father-in-law to let him know what Vera\'s dowry would be. The\ncount was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without\nconsideration he gave the first reply that came into his head. \"I like\nyour being businesslike about it.... I like it. You shall be\nsatisfied....\"\n\nAnd patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the\nconversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did\nnot know for certain how much Vera would have and did not receive at\nleast part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters\noff.\n\n\"Because, consider, Count--if I allowed myself to marry now\nwithout having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be\nacting badly....\"\n\nThe conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and\nto avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand\nfor eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on\nthe shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was\nimpossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty\nthousand in ready money. \"Or at least twenty thousand, Count,\" he\nadded, \"and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, all right!\" said the count hurriedly. \"Only excuse me, my\ndear fellow, I\'ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for\neighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.\"');

Since then she had not seen him. Before Sonya and her\nmother, if Boris happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of\nthat episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not\nworth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question\nwhether her engagement to Boris was a jest or an important, binding\npromise tormented her.\n\nSince Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen\nthe Rostovs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed\nnear Otradnoe, but had never been to see them.\n\nSometimes it occurred to Natasha that he did not wish to see her, and\nthis conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders\nspoke of him.\n\n\"Nowadays old friends are not remembered,\" the countess would say\nwhen Boris was mentioned.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently,\nseemed to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke\nrapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the\nbrilliant career on which he had entered. When the Rostovs came to\nPetersburg Boris called on them.\n\nHe drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natasha was\nhis most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of\nletting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between\nhimself and Natasha could not be binding either on her or on him. He\nhad a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with\nCountess Bezukhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to\nthe patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he\nenjoyed, and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the\nrichest heiresses in Petersburg, plans which might very easily be\nrealized. When he entered the Rostovs\' drawing room Natasha was in her\nown room. When she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the\ndrawing room, flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile.\n\nBoris remembered Natasha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining\nfrom under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had\nknown her four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a\ndifferent Natasha entered, and his face expressed rapturous\nastonishment. This expression on his face pleased Natasha.\n\n\"Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?\" asked the\ncountess.\n\nBoris kissed Natasha\'s hand and said that he was astonished at the\nchange in her.\n\n\"How handsome you have grown!\"\n\n\"I should think so!\" replied Natasha\'s laughing eyes.\n\n\"And is Papa older?\" she asked.\n\nNatasha sat down and, without joining in Boris\' conversation with\nthe countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood\'s suitor. He\nfelt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced\nat her occasionally.\n\nBoris\' uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were\nall comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natasha noticed at\nonce. He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess,\narranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his\nleft hand like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined\ncompression of his lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg\nsociety, recalling with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow\nacquaintances. It was not accidentally, Natasha felt, that he alluded,\nwhen speaking of the highest aristocracy, to an ambassador\'s ball he\nhad attended, and to invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.\n\nAll this time Natasha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her\nbrows. This gaze disturbed and confused Boris more and more. He looked\nround more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.\nHe did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.\nThe same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still\nlooked at him. After his first visit Boris said to himself that\nNatasha attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield\nto that feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune,\nwould mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations\nwithout intending to marry her would be dishonorable. Boris made up\nhis mind to avoid meeting Natasha, but despite that resolution he\ncalled again a few days later and began calling often and spending\nwhole days at the Rostovs\'. It seemed to him that he ought to have an\nexplanation with Natasha and tell her that the old times must be\nforgotten, that in spite of everything... she could not be his wife,\nthat he had no means, and they would never let her marry him. But he\nfailed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an\nexplanation. From day to day he became more and more entangled. It\nseemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love with Boris as\nof old. She sang him his favorite songs, showed him her album, making\nhim write in it, did not allow him to allude to the past, letting it\nbe understood how delightful was the present; and every day he went\naway in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and not knowing\nwhat he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end. He left off\nvisiting Helene and received reproachful notes from her every day, and\nyet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs.');

The countess--her prayerful mood dispelled--looked\nround and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: \"Can it be\nthat this couch will be my grave?\" Natasha, flushed and eager,\nseeing her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down,\nand unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing\nthat her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and,\nrapidly slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her\nslippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might\nbecome her grave. This couch was high, with a feather bed and five\npillows each smaller than the one below. Natasha jumped on it, sank\ninto the feather bed, rolled over to the wall, and began snuggling\nup the bedclothes as she settled down, raising her knees to her\nchin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly, now covering\nherself up head and all, and now peeping at her mother. The countess\nfinished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face, but\nseeing, that Natasha\'s head was covered, she smiled in her kind,\nweak way.\n\n\"Now then, now then!\" said she.\n\n\"Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?\" said Natasha. \"Now, just one on\nyour throat and another... that\'ll do!\" And seizing her mother round\nthe neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her\nmother Natasha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that\nhowever she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without\nhurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.\n\n\"Well, what is it tonight?\" said the mother, having arranged her\npillows and waited until Natasha, after turning over a couple of\ntimes, had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her\narms, and assumed a serious expression.\n\nThese visits of Natasha\'s at night before the count returned from\nhis club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and\ndaughter.\n\n\"What is it tonight?--But I have to tell you...\"\n\nNatasha put her hand on her mother\'s mouth.\n\n\"About Boris... I know,\" she said seriously; \"that\'s what I have\ncome about. Don\'t say it--I know. No, do tell me!\" and she removed her\nhand. \"Tell me, Mamma! He\'s nice?\"\n\n\"Natasha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say\nBoris is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what\nthen?... What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his\nhead, I can see that....\"\n\nAs she said this the countess looked round at her daughter.\nNatasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the\nmahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the\ncountess only saw her daughter\'s face in profile. That face struck her\nby its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.\n\nNatasha was listening and considering.\n\n\"Well, what then?\" said she.\n\n\"You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him?\nYou know you can\'t marry him.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Natasha, without changing her position.\n\n\"Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a\nrelation... and because you yourself don\'t love him.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I know. It is not right, darling!\"\n\n \"But if I want to...\" said Natasha.\n\n\"Leave off talking nonsense,\" said the countess.\n\n\"But if I want to...\"\n\n\"Natasha, I am in earnest...\"\n\nNatasha did not let her finish. She drew the countess\' large hand to\nher, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned\nit over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between\nthe knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, \"January, February,\nMarch, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don\'t you say anything? Speak!\"\nsaid she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her\ndaughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she\nhad wished to say.\n\n\"It won\'t do, my love! Not everyone will understand this\nfriendship dating from your childish days, and to see him so\nintimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who\nvisit us, and above all it torments him for nothing. He may already\nhave found a suitable and wealthy match, and now he\'s half crazy.\"\n\n\"Crazy?\" repeated Natasha.\n\n\"I\'ll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...\"\n\n\"I know! Cyril Matveich... but he is old.\"\n\n\"He was not always old. But this is what I\'ll do, Natasha, I\'ll have\na talk with Boris. He need not come so often....\"\n\n\"Why not, if he likes to?\"\n\n\"Because I know it will end in nothing....\"\n\n\"How can you know? No, Mamma, don\'t speak to him! What nonsense!\"\nsaid Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. \"Well,\nI won\'t marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it.\"\nNatasha smiled and looked at her mother. \"Not to marry, but just\nso,\" she added.\n\n\"How so, my pet?\"\n\n\"Just so. There\'s no need for me to marry him. But... just so.\"\n\n\"Just so, just so,\" repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she\nwent off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.\n\n\"Don\'t laugh, stop!\" cried Natasha. \"You\'re shaking the whole bed!\nYou\'re awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...\" and she\nseized the countess\' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little\nfinger, saying, \"June,\" and continued, kissing, \"July, August,\" on the\nother hand. \"But, Mamma, is he very much in love?

Police were stationed at the brightly lit\nentrance which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but\ndozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood\nat the porch. Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving,\nwith red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the\ncarriages emerged men wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while\nladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps\nwhich were let down for them with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly\nand noiselessly over the baize at the entrance.\n\nAlmost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through\nthe crowd and caps were doffed.\n\n\"The Emperor?... No, a minister.... prince... ambassador. Don\'t\nyou see the plumes?...\" was whispered among the crowd.\n\nOne person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone\nand mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.\n\nA third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostovs, who\nwere to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.\n\nThere had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in\nthe Rostov family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive,\nthat the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be\narranged as it should be.\n\nMarya Ignatevna Peronskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at\nthe court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the\ncountess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg high\nsociety, was to accompany them to the ball.\n\nThey were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten\no\'clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were\nnot yet dressed.\n\nNatasha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight\nthat morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all\nday. All her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring\nthat they all--she herself, Mamma, and Sonya--should be as well\ndressed as possible. Sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in\nher hands. The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and\nthe two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their\nbodices and their hair dressed a la grecque.\n\nEverything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks,\nand ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the\nopenwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were\nalready on; the hairdressing was almost done. Sonya was finishing\ndressing and so was the countess, but Natasha, who had bustled about\nhelping them all, was behindhand. She was still sitting before a\nlooking-glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender\nshoulders. Sonya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and,\npressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger, was\nfixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through it.\n\n\"That\'s not the way, that\'s not the way, Sonya!\" cried Natasha\nturning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the\nmaid who was dressing it had not time to release. \"That bow is not\nright. Come here!\"\n\nSonya sat down and Natasha pinned the ribbon on differently.\n\n\"Allow me, Miss! I can\'t do it like that,\" said the maid who was\nholding Natasha\'s hair.\n\n\"Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That\'s right, Sonya.\"\n\n\"Aren\'t you ready? It is nearly ten,\" came the countess\' voice.\n\n\"Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?\"\n\n\"I have only my cap to pin on.\"\n\n\"Don\'t do it without me!\" called Natasha. \"You won\'t do it right.\"\n\n\"But it\'s already ten.\"\n\nThey had decided to be at the ball by half past ten, and Natasha had\nstill to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.\n\nWhen her hair was done, Natasha, in her short petticoat from under\nwhich her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother\'s dressing jacket,\nran up to Sonya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother.\nTurning her mother\'s head this way and that, she fastened on the cap\nand, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were\nturning up the hem of her skirt.\n\nThe cause of the delay was Natasha\'s skirt, which was too long.\nTwo maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of\nthread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the\ncountess and Sonya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer\ngarment up high on one uplifted hand.\n\n\"Mavra, quicker, darling!\"\n\n\"Give me my thimble, Miss, from there...\"\n\n\"Whenever will you be ready?\" asked the count coming to the door.\n\"Here is some scent. Peronskaya must be tired of waiting.\"\n\n\"It\'s ready, Miss,\" said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze\ndress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as\nif by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of\nwhat she held.\n\nNatasha began putting on the dress.\n\n\"In a minute! In a minute! Don\'t come in, Papa!\" she cried to her\nfather as he opened the door--speaking from under the filmy skirt\nwhich still covered her whole face.\n\nSonya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in.\nHe was wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and\nwas perfumed and his hair pomaded.\n\n\"Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!\" cried Natasha, as she stood\nin the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.\n\n\"If you please, Miss! allow me,\" said the maid, who on her knees was\npulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of\nher mouth to the other with her tongue.\n\n\"Say what you like,\" exclaimed Sonya, in a despairing voice as she\nlooked at Natasha, \"say what you like, it\'s still too long.\"\n\nNatasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress\nwas too long.\n\n\"Really, madam, it is not at all too long,\" said Mavra, crawling\non her knees after her young lady.\n\n\"Well, if it\'s too long we\'ll take it up... we\'ll tack it up in\none minute,\" said the resolute Dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck\non the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set\nto work once more.\n\nAt that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in\nher cap and velvet gown.\n\n\"Oo-oo, my beauty!\" exclaimed the count, \"she looks better than\nany of you!\"\n\nHe would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside\nfearing to be rumpled.\n\n\"Mamma, your cap, more to this side,\" said Natasha. \"I\'ll arrange\nit,\" and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up\nher skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn\noff.\n\n\"Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!\"\n\n\"Never mind, I\'ll run it up, it won\'t show,\" said Dunyasha.\n\n\"What a beauty--a very queen!\" said the nurse as she came to the\ndoor. \"And Sonya! They are lovely!\"\n\nAt a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and\nstarted. But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.\n\nPeronskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she\nhad gone through the same process as the Rostovs, but with less\nflurry--for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was\nwashed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed\nbehind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing\nroom in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her\nold lady\'s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs\'\nservants had been.\n\nShe praised the Rostovs\' toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,\nand at eleven o\'clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they\nsettled themselves in their carriages and drove off.');

The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it\nwould come true, so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness\nand closeness of the carriage. She understood all that awaited her\nonly when, after stepping over the red baize at the entrance, she\nentered the hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside Sonya and in\nfront of her mother, mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between\nthe flowers. Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball,\nand tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable\nfor a girl on such an occasion. But, fortunately for her, she felt her\neyes growing misty, she saw nothing clearly, her pulse beat a\nhundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed at her heart. She\ncould not assume that pose, which would have made her ridiculous,\nand she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all\nher might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that became\nher best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering, also\ntalking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the\nlanding reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with\ndiamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.\n\nNatasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her\nreflection from the others. All was blended into one brilliant\nprocession. On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices,\nfootsteps, and greetings deafened Natasha, and the light and glitter\ndazzled her still more. The host and hostess, who had already been\nstanding at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to\nthe various arrivals, \"Charme de vous voir,\"* greeted the Rostovs\nand Peronskaya in the same manner.\n\n\n*\"Delighted to see you.\"\n\n\nThe two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her\nblack hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess\' eye\ninvoluntarily rested longer on the slim Natasha. She looked at her and\ngave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as\nhostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden,\nirrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The\nhost also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was\nhis daughter.\n\n\"Charming!\" said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.\n\nIn the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting\nthe Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front\nrows of that crowd. Natasha heard and felt that several people were\nasking about her and looking at her. She realized that those\nnoticing her liked her, and this observation helped to calm her.\n\n\"There are some like ourselves and some worse,\" she thought.\n\nPeronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important\npeople at the ball.\n\n\"That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,\"\nshe said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray\ncurly hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he\nsaid.\n\n\"Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezukhova,\" said\nPeronskaya, indicating Helene who had just entered. \"How lovely! She\nis quite equal to Marya Antonovna. See how the men, young and old, pay\ncourt to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince--is quite mad\nabout her. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even\nmore run after.\"\n\nShe pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very\nplain daughter.\n\n\"She is a splendid match, a millionairess,\" said Peronskaya. \"And\nlook, here come her suitors.\"\n\n\"That is Bezukhova\'s brother, Anatole Kuragin,\" she said, indicating\na handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head\nerect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies. \"He\'s\nhandsome, isn\'t he? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl.\nBut your cousin, Drubetskoy, is also very attentive to her. They say\nshe has millions. Oh yes, that\'s the French ambassador himself!\" she\nreplied to the countess\' inquiry about Caulaincourt. \"Looks as if he\nwere a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.\nNo one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still\nthe most beautiful of them all, our Marya Antonovna! And how simply\nshe is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the\nuniversal Freemason,\" she went on, indicating Pierre. \"Put him\nbeside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!\"\n\nPierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the\ncrowd and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly\nas if he were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through,\nevidently looking for someone.\n\nNatasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, \"the\nbuffoon,\" as Peronskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for\nthem, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and\nintroduce partners to her.\n\nBut before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome,\ndark man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a\nwindow talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natasha at\nonce recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it\nwas Bolkonski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger,\nhappier, and better-looking.\n\n\"There\'s someone else we know--Bolkonski, do you see, Mamma?\" said\nNatasha, pointing out Prince Andrew. \"You remember, he stayed a\nnight with us at Otradnoe.\"\n\n\"Oh, you know him?\" said Peronskaya. \"I can\'t bear him. Il fait a\npresent la pluie et le beau temps.* He\'s too proud for anything.\nTakes after his father. And he\'s hand in glove with Speranski, writing\nsome project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There\'s one\ntalking to him and he has turned away,\" she said, pointing at him.\n\"I\'d give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.\"\n\n\n*\"He is all the rage just now.\"');

He walked in rapidly, bowing\nto right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the\nreception over. The band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on\naccount of the words that had been set to it, beginning: \"Alexander,\nElisaveta, all our hearts you ravish quite...\" The Emperor passed on\nto the drawing room, the crowd made a rush for the doors, and\nseveral persons with excited faces hurried there and back again.\nThen the crowd hastily retired from the drawing-room door, at which\nthe Emperor reappeared talking to the hostess. A young man, looking\ndistraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking them to move aside.\nSome ladies, with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the\nrules of decorum, pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets.\nThe men began to choose partners and take their places for the\npolonaise.\n\nEveryone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing\nroom leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the\nmusic. The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina; then came\nambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Peronskaya\ndiligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners and\nwere taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the\npolonaise. Natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and\nSonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not\nhaving been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms\nhanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly,\nand with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight\nbefore her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She\nwas not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people\nwhom Peronskaya was pointing out--she had but one thought: \"Is it\npossible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to\ndance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?\nThey do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they\nwere saying, \'Ah, she\'s not the one I\'m after, so it\'s not worth\nlooking at her!\' No, it\'s impossible,\" she thought. \"They must know\nhow I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would\nenjoy dancing with me.\"\n\nThe strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable\ntime, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha\'s ears.\nShe wanted to cry. Peronskaya had left them. The count was at the\nother end of the room. She and the countess and Sonya were standing by\nthemselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of\nstrangers, with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone.\nPrince Andrew with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them.\nThe handsome Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and\nlooked at Natasha as one looks at a wall. Boris passed them twice\nand each time turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing,\ncame up to them.\n\nThis family gathering seemed humiliating to Natasha--as if there\nwere nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did\nnot listen to or look at Vera, who was telling her something about her\nown green dress.\n\nAt last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced\nwith three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the\nRostovs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they\nwere already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the\ndistinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The\nEmperor looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had\nyet begun dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went\nup to Countess Bezukhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly\nraised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him.\nThe aide-de-camp, an adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly\nround her waist, with confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding\nfirst round the edge of the circle, then at the corner of the room\nhe caught Helene\'s left hand and turned her, the only sound audible,\napart from the ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of\nthe spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his\npartner\'s velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled\nround. Natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not\nshe who was dancing that first turn of the waltz.\n\nPrince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing\nstockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in\nthe front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs. Baron Firhoff\nwas talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State\nto be held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with\nSperanski and participating in the work of the legislative commission,\ncould give reliable information about that sitting, concerning which\nvarious rumors were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was\nsaying, he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men\nintending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the\ncircle.\n\nPrince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor\'s\npresence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to\ndance.\n\nPierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.\n\n\"You always dance. I have a protegee, the young Rostova, here. Ask\nher,\" he said.\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Bolkonski. \"Excuse me!\" he added, turning to\nthe baron, \"we will finish this conversation elsewhere--at a ball\none must dance.\" He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.\nThe despairing, dejected expression of Natasha\'s face caught his\neye. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her\ndebut, remembered her conversation at the window, and with an\nexpression of pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostova.\n\n\"Allow me to introduce you to my daughter,\" said the countess,\nwith heightened color.\n\n\"I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess\nremembers me,\" said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite\nbelying Peronskaya\'s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching\nNatasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed\nhis invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on\nNatasha\'s face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly\nbrightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.\n\n\"I have long been waiting for you,\" that frightened happy little\ngirl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as\nshe raised her hand to Prince Andrew\'s shoulder. They were the\nsecond couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best\ndancers of his day and Natasha danced exquisitely. Her little feet\nin their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly,\nand independently of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic\nhappiness. Her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful--compared\nto Helene\'s her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But\nHelene seemed, as it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands\nof looks that had scanned her person, while Natasha was like a girl\nexposed for the first time, who would have felt very much ashamed\nhad she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary.\n\nPrince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as\npossible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed\nto him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he\ndisliked, caused by the Emperor\'s presence, he danced, and had\nchosen Natasha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she\nwas the first pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he\nembraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close\nto him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to\nhis head, and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after\nleaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.');

She\nnoticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did\nshe fail to notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French\nambassador, and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or\nthat Prince So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and\nthat Helene had great success and was honored by the special attention\nof So-and-so, but she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed\nthat he had gone because the ball became livelier after his departure.\nFor one of the merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again\nher partner. He reminded her of their first encounter in the Otradnoe\navenue, and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and\ntold her how he had involuntarily overheard her. Natasha blushed at\nthat recollection and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been\nsomething to be ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.\n\nLike all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked\nmeeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And\nsuch was Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and\neven her mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special\ncare and tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest\nand most unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the\nmiddle of the cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Natasha,\nstill out of breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer\nchose her. She was tired and panting and evidently thought of\ndeclining, but immediately put her hand gaily on the man\'s shoulder,\nsmiling at Prince Andrew.\n\n\"I\'d be glad to sit beside you and rest: I\'m tired; but you see\nhow they keep asking me, and I\'m glad of it, I\'m happy and I love\neverybody, and you and I understand it all,\" and much, much more was\nsaid in her smile. When her partner left her Natasha ran across the\nroom to choose two ladies for the figure.\n\n\"If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she\nwill be my wife,\" said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own\nsurprise, as he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.\n\n\"What rubbish sometimes enters one\'s head!\" thought Prince Andrew,\n\"but what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,\nthat she won\'t be dancing here a month before she will be\nmarried.... Such as she are rare here,\" he thought, as Natasha,\nreadjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself\nbeside him.\n\nWhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up\nto the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and\nasked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natasha did not\nanswer at once but only looked up with a smile that said\nreproachfully: \"How can you ask such a question?\"\n\n\"I have never enjoyed myself so much before!\" she said, and Prince\nAndrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her\nfather and instantly dropped again. Natasha was happier than she had\never been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one\nbecomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the\npossibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.\n\nAt that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the\nposition his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and\nabsent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing\nby a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one.\n\nOn her way to supper Natasha passed him.\n\nPierre\'s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of\nhim. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of\nher own happiness.\n\n\"How delightful it is, Count!\" said she. \"Isn\'t it?\"\n\nPierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.\n\n\"Yes, I am very glad,\" he said.\n\n\"How can people be dissatisfied with anything?\" thought Natasha.\n\"Especially such a capital fellow as Bezukhov!\" In Natasha\'s eyes\nall the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people,\nloving one another; none of them capable of injuring another--and so\nthey ought all to be happy.');

Today\'s events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our\nhistory,\" he concluded.\n\nPrince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the\nCouncil of State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which\nhe had attached such importance, and was surprised that this event,\nnow that it had taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite\ninsignificant. He listened with quiet irony to Bitski\'s enthusiastic\naccount of it. A very simple thought occurred to him: \"What does it\nmatter to me or to Bitski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the\nCouncil? Can all that make me any happier or better?\"\n\nAnd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest\nPrince Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to\ndine that evening at Speranski\'s, \"with only a few friends,\" as the\nhost had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the\nintimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested\nPrince Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his\ndomestic surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.\n\nAt the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house\nSperanski owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room\nthis small house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting\nthat of a monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the\nfriendly gathering of Speranski\'s intimate acquaintances already\nassembled at five o\'clock. There were no ladies present except\nSperanski\'s little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her\ngoverness. The other guests were Gervais, Magnitski, and Stolypin.\nWhile still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a\nringing staccato laugh--a laugh such as one hears on the stage.\nSomeone--it sounded like Speranski--was distinctly ejaculating\nha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard Speranski\'s famous\nlaugh, and this ringing, high pitched laughter from a statesman made a\nstrange impression on him.\n\nHe entered the dining room. The whole company were standing\nbetween two windows at a small table laid with hors-d\'oeuvres.\nSperanski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast,\nand evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had\nworn at the meeting of the Council of State, stood at the table with a\nbeaming countenance. His guests surrounded him. Magnitski,\naddressing himself to Speranski, was relating an anecdote, and\nSperanski was laughing in advance at what Magnitski was going to\nsay. When Prince Andrew entered the room Magnitski\'s words were\nagain crowned by laughter. Stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he\nmunched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed softly with a\nhissing chuckle, and Speranski in a high-pitched staccato manner.\n\nStill laughing, Speranski held out his soft white hand to Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\"Very pleased to see you, Prince,\" he said. \"One moment...\" he\nwent on, turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story. \"We have\nagreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about\nbusiness!\" and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.\n\nPrince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment,\nregret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not\nSperanski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared\nmysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and\nunattractive.\n\nAt dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed\nto consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before\nMagnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate\nsomething still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the\nstate service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in\nthis company the insignificance of those people was so definitely\naccepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good\nhumored ridicule. Speranski related how at the Council that morning\na deaf dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so\ntoo. Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable\nfor the stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolypin, stuttering,\nbroke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the\nabuses that existed under the former order of things--threatening to\ngive a serious turn to the conversation. Magnitski starting quizzing\nStolypin about his vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and\nthe talk reverted to its former lively tone.\n\nEvidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find\namusement in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his\nwish, tried to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety\nseemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speranski\'s\nhigh-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter\ngrated on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and\nfeared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company, but no\none took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood.\nThey all seemed very gay.\n\nHe tried several times to join in the conversation, but his\nremarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the\nwater, and he could not jest with them.\n\nThere was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was\nwitty and might have been funny, but it lacked just that something\nwhich is the salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a\nthing existed.\n\nAfter dinner Speranski\'s daughter and her governess rose. He\npatted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that\ngesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.\n\nThe men remained at table over their port--English fashion. In the\nmidst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon\'s Spanish\naffairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to\nexpress a contrary opinion. Speranski smiled and, with an evident wish\nto prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a\nstory that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few\nmoments all were silent.\n\nHaving sat some time at table, Speranski corked a bottle of wine\nand, remarking, \"Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,\"\npassed it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk\nloudly went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier\nwere handed to Speranski and he took them to his study. As soon as\nhe had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests\nbegan to converse sensibly and quietly with one another.\n\n\"Now for the recitation!\" said Speranski on returning from his\nstudy. \"A wonderful talent!\" he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnitski\nimmediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses\nin French which he had composed about various well-known Petersburg\npeople. He was interrupted several times by applause. When the\nverses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Speranski and took his\nleave.\n\n\"Where are you off to so early?\" asked Speranski.\n\n\"I promised to go to a reception.\"\n\nThey said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those\nmirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of\nhim to have expected anything from Speranski and from any of his own\nactivities connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance\nto what Speranski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang\nin Prince Andrew\'s ears long after he had left the house.\n\nWhen he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in\nPetersburg during those last four months as if it were something\nnew. He recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of\nhis project of army reform, which had been accepted for\nconsideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence\nsimply because another, a very poor one, had already been prepared and\nsubmitted to the Emperor. He thought of the meetings of a committee of\nwhich Berg was a member. He remembered how carefully and at what\nlength everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at\nthose meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that related to\nthe gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on the\nLegal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of\nthe Roman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of\nhimself. Then he vividly pictured to himself Bogucharovo, his\noccupations in the country, his journey to Ryazan; he remembered the\npeasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally applying to them the\nPersonal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he felt astonished\nthat he could have spent so much time on such useless work.');

Apart from considerations of politeness\nwhich demanded the call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl\nwho had left such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.\n\nNatasha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a\ndark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier\nthan in her ball dress. She and all the Rostov family welcomed him\nas an old friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he\nhad formerly judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of\nexcellent, simple, and kindly people. The old count\'s hospitality\nand good nature, which struck one especially in Petersburg as a\npleasant surprise, were such that Prince Andrew could not refuse to\nstay to dinner. \"Yes,\" he thought, \"they are capital people, who of\ncourse have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in\nNatasha; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting\nfor this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!\"\n\nIn Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely\nalien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,\nthat in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had\nalready begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no\nlonger and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered\nit found in it a new enjoyment.\n\nAfter dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrew\'s request, went to the\nclavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window\ntalking to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he\nceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had\nthought impossible for him. He looked at Natasha as she sang, and\nsomething new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the\nsame time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was\nready to weep. What about? His former love? The little princess? His\ndisillusionments?... His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The\nchief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the terrible contrast\nbetween something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that\nlimited and material something that he, and even she, was. This\ncontrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang.\n\nAs soon as Natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how\nhe liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling\nthat she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and\nsaid he liked her singing as he liked everything she did.\n\nPrince Andrew left the Rostovs\' late in the evening. He went to\nbed from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having\nlit his candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again\nnot at all troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and\njoyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into God\'s own\nfresh air. It did not enter his head that he was in love with Natasha;\nhe was not thinking about her, but only picturing her to himself,\nand in consequence all life appeared in a new light. \"Why do I strive,\nwhy do I toil in this narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with\nall its joys, is open to me?\" said he to himself. And for the first\ntime for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future.\nHe decided that he must attend to his son\'s education by finding a\ntutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire\nfrom the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and\nItaly. \"I must use my freedom while I feel so much strength and\nyouth in me,\" he said to himself. \"Pierre was right when he said one\nmust believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and\nnow I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead, but while one\nhas life one must live and be happy!\" thought he.');

Berg arrived in an\nimmaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed\nforward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.\n\n\"I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately\nshe could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more\nfortunate with you,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.\"\n\n\"I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count\" (Berg said this\nwith perfect conviction that this information could not but be\nagreeable), \"and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own\nand my wife\'s friends.\" (He smiled still more pleasantly.) \"I wished\nto ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to\nsupper.\"\n\nOnly Countess Helene, considering the society of such people as\nthe Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an\ninvitation. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at\nhis house a small but select company, and why this would give him\npleasure, and why though he grudged spending money on cards or\nanything harmful, he was prepared to run into some expense for the\nsake of good society--that Pierre could not refuse, and promised to\ncome.\n\n\"But don\'t be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten\nminutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is\ncoming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you\nwill do me the favor.\"\n\nContrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at\nthe Bergs\' house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.\n\nHaving prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were\nready for their guests\' arrival.\n\nIn their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and\npictures and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely\nbuttoned up in his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to\nher that one always could and should be acquainted with people above\none, because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.\n\n\"You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I\nmanaged from my first promotion.\" (Berg measured his life not by years\nbut by promotions.) \"My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only\nwaiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to\nbe your husband.\" (He rose and kissed Vera\'s hand, and on the way to\nher straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) \"And how\nhave I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my\naquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious\nand methodical.\"\n\nBerg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and\npaused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak\nwoman who could not understand all that constitutes a man\'s dignity,\nwhat it was ein Mann zu sein.* Vera at the same time smiling with a\nsense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the\nsame understood life wrongly, as according to Vera all men did.\nBerg, judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. Vera,\njudging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation,\nsupposed that all men, though they understand nothing and are\nconceited and selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.\n\n\n*To be a man.\n\n\nBerg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her\nlace fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on\nthe lips.\n\n\"The only thing is, we mustn\'t have children too soon,\" he\ncontinued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Vera, \"I don\'t at all want that. We must live for\nsociety.\"\n\n\"Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this,\" said Berg,\npointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.\n\nJust then Count Bezukhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced\nat one another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally\nclaiming the honor of this visit.\n\n\"This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,\" thought\nBerg. \"This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.\"\n\n\"But please don\'t interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,\"\nsaid Vera, \"because I know what interests each of them and what to say\nto different people.\"\n\nBerg smiled again.\n\n\"It can\'t be helped: men must sometimes have masculine\nconversation,\" said he.\n\nThey received Pierre in their small, new drawing-room, where it\nwas impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,\nneatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange\nthat Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an\narmchair or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently\npainfully undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor\nto settle the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry\nby moving a chair for himself, and Berg and Vera immediately began\ntheir evening party, interrupting each other in their efforts to\nentertain their guest.\n\nVera, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be\nentertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once\nbegan accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation\nwas required, interrupted his wife\'s remarks and touched on the\nquestion of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the\ngeneral subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made\nhim to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had\ndeclined them. Though the conversation was very incoherent and Vera\nwas angry at the intrusion of the masculine element, both husband\nand wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only one guest was\npresent, their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas\nto every other evening party with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.\n\nBefore long Boris, Berg\'s old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of\ncondescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vera. After\nBoris came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the\nRostovs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other\nevening parties. Berg and Vera could not repress their smiles of\nsatisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing\nroom, at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of\ndresses, and the bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody\nalways has it, especially so the general, who admired the apartment,\npatted Berg on the shoulder, and with parental authority superintended\nthe setting out of the table for boston. The general sat down by Count\nIlya Rostov, who was next to himself the most important guest. The old\npeople sat with the old, the young with the young, and the hostess\nat the tea table, on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a\nsilver cake basket as the Panins had at their party. Everything was\njust as it was everywhere else.');

At the card table\nhe happened to be directly facing Natasha, and was struck by a curious\nchange that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and\nnot only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from\nplainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around.\n\n\"What\'s the matter with her?\" thought Pierre, glancing at her. She\nwas sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without\nlooking at him, made some reply to Boris who sat down beside her.\nAfter playing out a whole suit and to his partner\'s delight taking\nfive tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who\nhad entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again\nat Natasha.\n\n\"What has happened to her?\" he asked himself with still greater\nsurprise.\n\nPrince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her\nwith a look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was\nlooking up at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid\nbreathing. And the bright glow of some inner fire that had been\nsuppressed was again alight in her. She was completely transformed and\nfrom a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball.\n\nPrince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and\nyouthful expression in his friend\'s face.\n\nPierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now\nwith his back to Natasha and now facing her, but during the whole of\nthe six rubbers he watched her and his friend.\n\n\"Something very important is happening between them,\" thought\nPierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him\nand made him neglect the game.\n\nAfter six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use\nplaying like that, and Pierre was released. Natasha on one side was\ntalking with Sonya and Boris, and Vera with a subtle smile was\nsaying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and,\nasking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them.\nVera, having noticed Prince Andrew\'s attentions to Natasha, decided\nthat at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the\ntender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when\nPrince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about\nfeelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest\nas she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ\nher diplomatic tact.\n\nWhen Pierre went up to them he noticed that Vera was being carried\naway by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed\nembarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.\n\n\"What do you think?\" Vera was saying with an arch smile. \"You are so\ndiscerning, Prince, and understand people\'s characters so well at a\nglance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her\nattachments? Could she, like other women\" (Vera meant herself),\n\"love a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is\nwhat I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?\"\n\n\"I know your sister too little,\" replied Prince Andrew, with a\nsarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, \"to\nbe able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed\nthat the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to\nbe,\" he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.\n\n\"Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days,\" continued Vera--mentioning\n\"our days\" as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing,\nimagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of\n\"our days\" and that human characteristics change with the times--\"in\nour days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted\noften stifles real feeling in her. And it must be confessed that\nNatalie is very susceptible.\" This return to the subject of Natalie\ncaused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about\nto rise, but Vera continued with a still more subtle smile:\n\n\"I think no one has been more courted than she,\" she went on, \"but\ntill quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you\nknow, Count,\" she said to Pierre, \"even our dear cousin Boris, who,\nbetween ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...\"\n(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).\n\nPrince Andrew frowned and remained silent.\n\n\"You are friendly with Boris, aren\'t you?\" asked Vera.\n\n\"Yes, I know him...\"\n\n\"I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natasha?\"\n\n\"Oh, there was childish love?\" suddenly asked Prince Andrew,\nblushing unexpectedly.\n\n\"Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le\ncousinage est un dangereux voisinage.* Don\'t you think so?\"\n\n\n*\"Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, undoubtedly!\" said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural\nliveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very\ncareful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of\nthese jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew\nhim aside.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Pierre, seeing his friend\'s strange animation with\nsurprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Natasha as he rose.\n\n\"I must... I must have a talk with you,\" said Prince Andrew. \"You\nknow that pair of women\'s gloves?\" (He referred to the Masonic\ngloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he\nloved.) \"I... but no, I will talk to you later on,\" and with a strange\nlight in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew\napproached Natasha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince\nAndrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.\n\nBut at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he\nshould take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on\nthe affairs in Spain.\n\nBerg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his\nface. The party was very successful and quite like other parties he\nhad seen. Everything was similar: the ladies\' subtle talk, the\ncards, the general raising his voice at the card table, and the\nsamovar and the tea cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had\nalways seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate. They had\nnot yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about\nsomething important and clever. Now the general had begun such a\ndiscussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.');

Not\nonly in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natasha,\nbut in the whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something\nimportant that was bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and\nsternly serious eyes at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natasha and\ntimidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon\nas he looked her way. Sonya was afraid to leave Natasha and afraid\nof being in the way when she was with them. Natasha grew pale, in a\npanic of expectation, when she remained alone with him for a moment.\nPrince Andrew surprised her by his timidity. She felt that he wanted\nto say something to her but could not bring himself to do so.\n\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to\nNatasha and whispered: \"Well, what?\"\n\n\"Mamma! For heaven\'s sake don\'t ask me anything now! One can\'t\ntalk about that,\" said Natasha.\n\nBut all the same that night Natasha, now agitated and now\nfrightened, lay a long time in her mother\'s bed gazing straight\nbefore her. She told her how he had complimented her, how he told\nher he was going abroad, asked her where they were going to spend\nthe summer, and then how he had asked her about Boris.\n\n\"But such a... such a... never happened to me before!\" she said.\n\"Only I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I\'m\nwith him. What does that mean? Does it mean that it\'s the real\nthing? Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?\"\n\n\"No, my love; I am frightened myself,\" answered her mother. \"Now\ngo!\"\n\n\"All the same I shan\'t sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!\nMummy! such a thing never happened to me before,\" she said,\nsurprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. \"And\ncould we ever have thought!...\"\n\nIt seemed to Natasha that even at the time she first saw Prince\nAndrew at Otradnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she\nfeared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very\nman she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and\nof finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.\n\n\"And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg\nwhile we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that\nball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!\nAlready then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.\"\n\n\"What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...\"\nsaid her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince\nAndrew had written in Natasha\'s album.\n\n\"Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?\"\n\n\"Don\'t, Natasha! Pray to God. \'Marriages are made in heaven,\'\"\nsaid her mother.\n\n\"Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!\" cried Natasha,\nshedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.\n\nAt that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and\ntelling him of his love for Natasha and his firm resolve to make her\nhis wife.\n\nThat day Countess Helene had a reception at her house. The French\nambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of\nlate become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies\nand gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the\nrooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and\nmorose air.\n\nSince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous\ndepression and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the\nintimacy of his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly\nbeen made a gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had\nbegun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark\nthoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than\nbefore. At the same time the feeling he had noticed between his\nprotegee Natasha and Prince Andrew accentuated his gloom by the\ncontrast between his own position and his friend\'s. He tried equally\nto avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natasha and Prince Andrew;\nand again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with\neternity; again the question: for what? presented itself; and he\nforced himself to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to\ndrive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, after\nhe had left the countess\' apartments, he was sitting upstairs in a\nshabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction of the\nScottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with\ntobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Ah, it\'s you!\" said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.\n\"And I, you see, am hard at it.\" He pointed to his manuscript book\nwith that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy\npeople look at their work.\n\nPrince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life\non his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,\nsmiled at him with the egotism of joy.\n\n\"Well, dear heart,\" said he, \"I wanted to tell you about it\nyesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything\nlike it before. I am in love, my friend!\"\n\nSuddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person\ndown on the sofa beside Prince Andrew.\n\n\"With Natasha Rostova, yes?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,\nbut the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and\nsuffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in\nthe world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can\'t live\nwithout her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why\ndon\'t you speak?\"\n\n\"I? I? What did I tell you?\" said Pierre suddenly, rising and\nbeginning to pace up and down the room. \"I always thought it....\nThat girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,\nI entreat you, don\'t philosophize, don\'t doubt, marry, marry,\nmarry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.\"\n\n\"But what of her?\"\n\n\"She loves you.\"\n\n\"Don\'t talk rubbish...\" said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into\nPierre\'s eyes.\n\n\"She does, I know,\" Pierre cried fiercely.\n\n\"But do listen,\" returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. \"Do\nyou know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.\"\n\n\"Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,\" said Pierre, and his face\nreally changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to\nPrince Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a\ndifferent, quite a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for\nlife, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he\nmade up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in\nhis soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future,\nsaid he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father\'s caprice,\nand spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this\nmarriage and love her, or would do without his consent; then he\nmarveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange,\napart from and independent of himself.\n\n\"I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of\nsuch love,\" said Prince Andrew. \"It is not at all the same feeling\nthat I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into\ntwo halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the\nother half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom\nand darkness....\"\n\n\"Darkness and gloom,\" reiterated Pierre: \"yes, yes, I understand\nthat.\"\n\n\"I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very\nhappy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched\nand sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew\'s lot\nappeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.');

He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to\nalter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life\nwas already ending. \"If only they would let me end my days as I want\nto,\" thought the old man, \"then they might do as they please.\" With\nhis son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for\nimportant occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole\nmatter.\n\nIn the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards\nbirth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young\nas he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special\nstress on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son\nwhom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. \"Fourthly\nand finally,\" the father said, looking ironically at his son, \"I beg\nyou to put it off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as\nyou wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your\nlove or passion or obstinacy--as you please--is still as great, marry!\nAnd that\'s my last word on it. Mind, the last...\" concluded the\nprince, in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his\ndecision.\n\nPrince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his\nfeelings, or his fiancee\'s, would not stand a year\'s test, or that\nhe (the old prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to\nconform to his father\'s wish--to propose, and postpone the wedding for\na year.\n\nThree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostovs,\nPrince Andrew returned to Petersburg.\n\n\nNext day after her talk with her mother Natasha expected Bolkonski\nall day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the\nsame. Pierre did not come either and Natasha, not knowing that\nPrince Andrew had gone to see his father, could not explain his\nabsence to herself.\n\nThree weeks passed in this way. Natasha had no desire to go out\nanywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and\nlistless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in\nthe evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed\nto her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing\nat her and pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound\nto her vanity intensified her misery.\n\nOnce she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly\nbegan to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not\nknow why it is being punished.\n\nThe countess began to soothe Natasha, who after first listening to\nher mother\'s words, suddenly interrupted her:\n\n\"Leave off, Mamma! I don\'t think, and don\'t want to think about\nit! He just came and then left off, left off...\"\n\nHer voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and\nwent on quietly:\n\n\"And I don\'t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I\nhave now become quite calm, quite calm.\"\n\nThe day after this conversation Natasha put on the old dress which\nshe knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the\nmornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she\nhad abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went\nto the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud\nresonance, and began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished\nher first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and\nsang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her. She listened\njoyfully (as though she had not expected it) to the charm of the notes\nreverberating, filling the whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying\naway; and all at once she felt cheerful. \"What\'s the good of making so\nmuch of it? Things are nice as it is,\" she said to herself, and she\nbegan walking up and down the room, not stepping simply on the\nresounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the\ntoe (she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening to the\nregular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to\nthe sounds of her own voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it.\n\"There, that\'s me!\" the expression of her face seemed to say as she\ncaught sight of herself. \"Well, and very nice too! I need nobody.\"\n\nA footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room\nbut she would not let him, and having closed the door behind him\ncontinued her walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite\nmood--love of, and delight in, herself. \"How charming that Natasha\nis!\" she said again, speaking as some third, collective, male\nperson. \"Pretty, a good voice, young, and in nobody\'s way if only they\nleave her in peace.\" But however much they left her in peace she could\nnot now be at peace, and immediately felt this.\n\nIn the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, \"At home?\" and\nthen footsteps were heard. Natasha was looking at the mirror, but\ndid not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When\nshe saw herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for\ncertain, though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.\n\nPale and agitated, Natasha ran into the drawing room.\n\n\"Mamma! Bolkonski has come!\" she said. \"Mamma, it is awful, it is\nunbearable! I don\'t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...\"\n\nBefore the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room\nwith an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natasha his\nface brightened. He kissed the countess\' hand and Natasha\'s, and sat\ndown beside the sofa.\n\n\"It is long since we had the pleasure...\" began the countess, but\nPrince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,\nobviously in haste to say what he had to.\n\n\"I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my\nfather\'s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I\nonly got back last night,\" he said glancing at Natasha; \"I want to\nhave a talk with you, Countess,\" he added after a moment\'s pause.\n\nThe countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.\n\n\"I am at your disposal,\" she murmured.\n\nNatasha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:\nsomething gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared\nstraight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.\n\n\"At once? This instant!... No, it can\'t be!\" she thought.\n\nAgain he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she\nwas not mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be\ndecided.\n\n\"Go, Natasha! I will call you,\" said the countess in a whisper.\n\nNatasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew\nand at her mother and went out.\n\n\"I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter\'s hand,\" said\nPrince Andrew.\n\nThe countess\' face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.\n\n\"Your offer...\" she began at last sedately. He remained silent,\nlooking into her eyes. \"Your offer...\" (she grew confused) \"is\nagreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband...\nI hope... but it will depend on her....\"\n\n\"I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it\nto me?\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and\nwith a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips\nto his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him\nas a son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man.\n\"I am sure my husband will consent,\" said the countess, \"but your\nfather...\"\n\n\"My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express\ncondition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a\nyear. And I wished to tell you of that,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"It is true that Natasha is still young, but--so long as that?...\"\n\n\"It is unavoidable,\" said Prince Andrew with a sigh.\n\n\"I will send her to you,\" said the countess, and left the room.\n\n\"Lord have mercy upon us!\" she repeated while seeking her daughter.\n\nSonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom. Natasha was sitting on\nthe bed, pale and dry eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering\nsomething as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped\nup and flew to her.\n\n\"Well, Mamma?... Well?...\"\n\n\"Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,\" said the countess,\ncoldly it seemed to Natasha. \"Go... go,\" said the mother, sadly and\nreproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.\n\nNatasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When\nshe came in and saw him she paused. \"Is it possible that this stranger\nhas now become everything to me?\" she asked herself, and immediately\nanswered, \"Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than\neverything in the world.\" Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast\neyes.\n\n\"I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?\"\n\nHe looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned\nexpression of her face. Her face said: \"Why ask? Why doubt what you\ncannot but know? Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?\"\n\nShe drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.\n\n\"Do you love me?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" Natasha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed\nloudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.\n\n\"What is it? What\'s the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so happy!\" she replied, smiled through her tears, bent\nover closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether\nshe might, and then kissed him.\n\nPrince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find\nin his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly\nchanged; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of\ndesire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness,\nfear at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful\nsense of the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present\nfeeling, though not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger\nand more serious.\n\n\"Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?\" asked\nPrince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.\n\n\"Is it possible that I--the \'chit of a girl,\' as everybody called\nme,\" thought Natasha--\"is it possible that I am now to be the wife and\nthe equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father\nlooks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no\nmore playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies\na responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he\nask me?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, but she had not understood his question.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" he said. \"But you are so young, and I have already\nbeen through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know\nyourself.\"\n\nNatasha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing\nto take in the meaning of his words.\n\n\"Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,\" continued\nPrince Andrew, \"it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask\nyou to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall\nremain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or\nshould you come to love...\" said Prince Andrew with an unnatural\nsmile.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" Natasha interrupted him. \"You know that\nfrom the very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you,\" she\ncried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.\n\n\"In a year you will learn to know yourself....\"\n\n\"A whole year!\" Natasha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that\nthe marriage was to be postponed for a year. \"But why a year? Why a\nyear?...\"\n\nPrince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.\nNatasha did not hear him.\n\n\"And can\'t it be helped?\" she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,\nbut his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.\n\n\"It\'s awful! Oh, it\'s awful! awful!\" Natasha suddenly cried, and\nagain burst into sobs. \"I shall die, waiting a year: it\'s\nimpossible, it\'s awful!\" She looked into her lover\'s face and saw in\nit a look of commiseration and perplexity.\n\n\"No, no! I\'ll do anything!\" she said, suddenly checking her tears.\n\"I am so happy.\"\n\nThe father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed\ncouple their blessing.\n\nFrom that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostovs\' as\nNatasha\'s affianced lover.');

He said\nthat as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole\nburden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever,\nbut that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom.\nIf after six months she felt that she did not love him she would\nhave full right to reject him. Naturally neither Natasha nor her\nparents wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came\nevery day to the Rostovs\', but did not behave to Natasha as an\naffianced lover: he did not use the familiar thou, but said you to\nher, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement, quite\ndifferent, intimate, and natural relations sprang up between them.\nIt was as if they had not known each other till now. Both liked to\nrecall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were\nnothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite different\nbeings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere. At first\nthe family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew;\nhe seemed a man from another world, and for a long time Natasha\ntrained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all\nthat he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all of\nthem, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to\nbe. After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without\nrestraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he\ntook his part. He could talk about rural economy with the count,\nfashions with the countess and Natasha, and about albums and fancywork\nwith Sonya. Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his\npresence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the\nevident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew\'s coming to Otradnoe\nand their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natasha and\nPrince Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and\nAndrew\'s encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents\nbetokening that it had to be.\n\nIn the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always\naccompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting\ntogether everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and\ngo away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely\nspoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to\nspeak of it. Natasha shared this as she did all his feelings, which\nshe constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his\nson. Prince Andrew blushed, as he often did now--Natasha\nparticularly liked it in him--and said that his son would not live\nwith them.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Natasha in a frightened tone.\n\n\"I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...\"\n\n\"How I should have loved him!\" said Natasha, immediately guessing\nhis thought; \"but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding\nfault with us.\"\n\nSometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask\nhis advice about Petya\'s education or Nicholas\' service. The old\ncountess sighed as she looked at them; Sonya was always getting\nfrightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for\nleaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew\nspoke (he could tell a story very well), Natasha listened to him\nwith pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed\nattentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in\nperplexity: \"What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover\nsomething by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?\"\nSometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic\nof her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince\nAndrew laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned\nhimself entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always\nfelt nearer to him. Natasha would have been completely happy if the\nthought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not\nterrified her, just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and\ncold.\n\nOn the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought\nwith him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostovs\' once since the ball.\nPierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the\ncountess, and Natasha sat down beside a little chess table with Sonya,\nthereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.\n\n\"You have known Bezukhov a long time?\" he asked. \"Do you like him?\"\n\n\"Yes, he\'s a dear, but very absurd.\"\n\nAnd as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of\nhis absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.\n\n\"Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known\nhim from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,\"\nPrince Andrew said with sudden seriousness--\"I am going away and\nheaven knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know\nI am not to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when\nI am not here...\"\n\n\"What can happen?\"\n\n\"Whatever trouble may come,\" Prince Andrew continued, \"I beg you,\nMademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for\nadvice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but\nhe has a heart of gold.\"\n\nNeither her father, nor her mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrew\nhimself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would\nact on Natasha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that\nday, dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not\nunderstanding what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking\nleave, he kissed her hand for the last time. \"Don\'t go!\" she said in a\ntone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and\nwhich he remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone;\nbut for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no\ninterest in anything and only saying now and then, \"Oh, why did he\ngo away?\"\n\nBut a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around\nher, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and\nbecame her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy,\nas a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of\nface.');

He grew still more\nirritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of\nhis frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out\nher tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.\nPrincess Mary had two passions and consequently two joys--her\nnephew, little Nicholas, and religion--and these were the favorite\nsubjects of the prince\'s attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken\nof he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or\nthe petting and spoiling of children. \"You want to make him\"--little\nNicholas--\"into an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants\na son and not an old maid,\" he would say. Or, turning to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary\'s presence\nhow she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.\n\nHe continually hurt Princess Mary\'s feelings and tormented her,\nbut it cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame\ntoward her, or could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of\nit all, be unjust? And what is justice? The princess never thought\nof that proud word \"justice.\" All the complex laws of man centered for\nher in one clear and simple law--the law of love and self-sacrifice\ntaught us by Him who lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself\nwas God. What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other\npeople? She had to endure and love, and that she did.\n\nDuring the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had\nbeen gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known\nhim for a long time past. She felt that something had happened to him,\nbut he said nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a\nlong talk with his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed\nthat before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another.\n\nSoon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend\nJulie Karagina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls\ndream) of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in\nmourning for her own brother, killed in Turkey.\n\n\nSorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.\n\nYour loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a\nspecial providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your\nexcellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can--I\nwill not say comfort us--but save us from despair. Religion alone can\nexplain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what\ncause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life--not merely\nharming no one but necessary to the happiness of others--are called away\nto God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden\nto themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I saw, and\none I shall never forget--that of my dear sister-in-law--left that\nimpression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had\nto die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged\nanyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to\ndie. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since\nthen, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly\nwhy she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression of\nthe infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though\ngenerally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite\nlove for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically\ninnocent to have the strength to perform all a mother\'s duties. As a\nyoung wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so as\na mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince\nAndrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will\nthere receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of\nher alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent\ninfluence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at\nthe moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should\nthen have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and\ncertain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you of\nthe Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a\nsingle hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is\ngoverned only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for\nour good.\n\nYou ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my\nwish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You\nwill be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte!\nThe case is this: my father\'s health is growing noticeably worse, he\ncannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This\nirritability is, as you know, chiefly directed to political questions.\nHe cannot endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal\nterms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own,\nthe grandson of the Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite\nindifferent to politics, but from my father\'s remarks and his talks\nwith Michael Ivanovich I know all that goes on in the world and\nespecially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who only at\nBald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a great\nman, still less as Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand this.\nIt seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views\nthat my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he\nforesees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing\nhis views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive\nfrom a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes\nabout Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will be\ndecided very shortly.\n\nOur family life goes on in the old way except for my brother\nAndrew\'s absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much\nof late. After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his\nspirits. He has again become as I used to know him when a child: kind,\naffectionate, with that heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has\nrealized, it seems to me, that life is not over for him. But\ntogether with this mental change he has grown physically much\nweaker. He has become thinner and more nervous. I am anxious about him\nand glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended\nlong ago. I hope it will cure him. You write that in Petersburg he\nis spoken of as one of the most active, cultivated, and capable of the\nyoung men. Forgive my vanity as a relation, but I never doubted it.\nThe good he has done to everybody here, from his peasants up to the\ngentry, is incalculable. On his arrival in Petersburg he received only\nhis due. I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to\nMoscow, especially such false ones as that you write about--I mean the\nreport of my brother\'s betrothal to the little Rostova. I do not think\nmy brother will ever marry again, and certainly not her; and this is\nwhy: first, I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he\nhas lost, the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for\nhim ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a\nstepmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that girl is not the\nkind of girl who could please Prince Andrew. I do not think he would\nchoose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish it. But I am\nrunning on too long and am at the end of my second sheet. Good-by,\nmy dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty care.

He informed her of his engagement to\nNatasha Rostova. The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his\nbetrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister. He\nwrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he\nunderstand and know what life was. He asked his sister to forgive\nhim for not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited\nBald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his father. He had not\ndone so for fear Princess Mary should ask her father to give his\nconsent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his\ndispleasure without attaining her object. \"Besides,\" he wrote, \"the\nmatter was not then so definitely settled as it is now. My father then\ninsisted on a delay of a year and now already six months, half of that\nperiod, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever. If the\ndoctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia,\nbut as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You know\nme and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have\nbeen and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and\narouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a\nshort time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him\nabout the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand\nhim the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and\nwhether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four\nmonths.\"\n\nAfter long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave\nthe letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her\nquietly:\n\n\"Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won\'t\nbe long--I shall soon set him free.\"\n\nThe princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her\nspeak and, raising his voice more and more, cried:\n\n\"Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,\neh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell\nhim that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little\nNicholas\' stepmother and I\'ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He\nmustn\'t be without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more\nwomen are wanted in my house--let him marry and live by himself.\nPerhaps you will go and live with him too?\" he added, turning to\nPrincess Mary. \"Go in heavens name! Go out into the frost... the\nfrost... the frost!\"\n\nAfter this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the\nmatter. But repressed vexation at his son\'s poor-spirited behavior\nfound expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former\npretexts for irony a fresh one was now added--allusions to stepmothers\nand amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\"Why shouldn\'t I marry her?\" he asked his daughter. \"She\'ll make a\nsplendid princess!\"\n\nAnd latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary\nnoticed that her father was really associating more and more with\nthe Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his\nletter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to\nthe idea.\n\nLittle Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion\nwere Princess Mary\'s joys and consolations; but besides that, since\neveryone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest\ndepths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the\nchief consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were\ngiven her by God\'s folk--the half-witted and other pilgrims who\nvisited her without the prince\'s knowledge. The longer she lived, the\nmore experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her\nwonder at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and\nhappiness here on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming\none another, to obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness.\nPrince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough:\nhe wanted to bind his happiness to another woman. Her father objected\nto this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for\nAndrew. And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another\nand injured their souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of\nbenefits which endure but for an instant. Not only do we know this\nourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth and told us\nthat this life is but for a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to\nit and think to find happiness in it. \"How is it that no one realizes\nthis?\" thought Princess Mary. \"No one except these despised God\'s folk\nwho, wallet on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen\nby the prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of\ncausing him to sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of\nworldly welfare, in order without clinging to anything to wander in\nhempen rags from place to place under an assumed name, doing no one\nany harm but praying for all--for those who drive one away as well as\nfor those who protect one: higher than that life and truth there is no\nlife or truth!\"\n\nThere was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty\ncalled Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot\nand worn heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her.\nOnce, when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia\nwas talking of her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found\nthe true path of life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force\nthat she resolved to become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone\nto sleep Princess Mary thought about this for a long time, and at last\nmade up her mind that, strange as it might seem, she must go on a\npilgrimage. She disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor,\nFather Akinfi, the monk, and he approved of her intention. Under guise\nof a present for the pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim\'s\ncomplete costume for herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough\ncoat, and a black kerchief. Often, approaching the chest of drawers\ncontaining this secret treasure, Princess Mary paused, uncertain\nwhether the time had not already come to put her project into\nexecution.\n\nOften, listening to the pilgrims\' tales, she was so stimulated by\ntheir simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep\nmeaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning\neverything and running away from home. In imagination she already\npictured herself by Theodosia\'s side, dressed in coarse rags,\nwalking with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road,\ndirecting her wanderings from one saint\'s shrine to another, free from\nenvy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where\nthere is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.\n\n\"I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to\nget used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on\ntill my legs fail, and I\'ll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at\nlast reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow\nnor sighing...\" thought Princess Mary.\n\nBut afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko\n(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that\nshe was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.');

Fallen man\nhas retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not\nonly because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but\nbecause our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at\nease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If\nman could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was\nfulfilling his duty, he would have found one of the conditions of\nman\'s primitive blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and\nirreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class--the military. The\nchief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in\nthis compulsory and irreproachable idleness.\n\nNicholas Rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full\nwhen, after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pavlograd regiment,\nin which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from\nDenisov.\n\nRostov had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow\nacquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked\nand respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was\nwell contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters\nfrom home more frequent complaints from his mother that their\naffairs were falling into greater and greater disorder, and that it\nwas time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents.\n\nReading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to\ntake him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the\nentanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt\nthat sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life,\nwith its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its\naccounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society,\nand with Sonya\'s love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully\ndifficult and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold,\nformal letters in French, beginning: \"My dear Mamma,\" and ending:\n\"Your obedient son,\" which said nothing of when he would return. In\n1810 he received letters from his parents, in which they told him of\nNatasha\'s engagement to Bolkonski, and that the wedding would be in\na year\'s time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter\ngrieved and mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that\nNatasha, for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family,\nshould be lost to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of\nview, he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow\nBolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after\nall, and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with permission\nfrom his dotard father. For a moment he hesitated whether he should\nnot apply for leave in order to see Natasha before she was married,\nbut then came the maneuvers, and considerations about Sonya and\nabout the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off.\nBut in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his\nmother, written without his father\'s knowledge, and that letter\npersuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take\nmatters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and\nthey would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and\ntrusted Mitenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody\ntook advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. \"For\nGod\'s sake, I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make\nme and the whole family wretched,\" wrote the countess.\n\nThis letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a\nmatter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.\n\nThe right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any\nrate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but\nafter his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely\nvicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and\nwhen he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka\n(Denisov\'s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who\nturned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was\ngoing home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he\nwould go away without having heard from the staff--and this interested\nhim extremely--whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive\nthe Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to\nthink that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the\nPolish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had\nbetted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it\nseemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish\nMademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had\ngiven one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would\ntake place without him--he knew he must go away from this good, bright\nworld to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week\nlater he obtained his leave. His hussar comrades--not only those of\nhis own regiment, but the whole brigade--gave Rostov a dinner to which\nthe subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were\ntwo bands and two choirs of singers. Rostov danced the Trepak with\nMajor Basov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped\nRostov; the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted\n\"hurrah!\" and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as\nfar as the first post station.\n\nDuring the first half of the journey--from Kremenchug to Kiev--all\nRostov\'s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with\nthe squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to\nforget his three roans and Dozhoyveyko, his quartermaster, and to\nwonder anxiously how things would be at Otradnoe and what he would\nfind there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached\nit--far stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law\nby which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the\nsquare of the distance. At the last post station before Otradnoe he\ngave the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran\nbreathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.\n\nAfter the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of\nunsatisfied expectation--the feeling that \"everything is just the\nsame, so why did I hurry?\"--Nicholas began to settle down in his old\nhome world. His father and mother were much the same, only a little\nolder. What was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional\ndiscord, which there used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found\nout, was due to the bad state of their affairs. Sonya was nearly\ntwenty; she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more\nthan she was already, but that was enough. She exhaled happiness and\nlove from the time Nicholas returned, and the faithful, unalterable\nlove of this girl had a gladdening effect on him. Petya and Natasha\nsurprised Nicholas most. Petya was a big handsome boy of thirteen,\nmerry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking.\nAs for Natasha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed\nwhenever he looked at her.\n\n\"You\'re not the same at all,\" he said.\n\n\"How? Am I uglier?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!\" he whispered to\nher.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" cried Natasha, joyfully.\n\nShe told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit\nto Otradnoe and showed him his last letter.\n\n\"Well, are you glad?\" Natasha asked. \"I am so tranquil and happy\nnow.\"\n\n\"Very glad,\" answered Nicholas. \"He is an excellent fellow.... And\nare you very much in love?\"\n\n\"How shall I put it?\" replied Natasha. \"I was in love with Boris,\nwith my teacher, and with Denisov, but this is quite different. I feel\nat peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists, and\nI am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.\"\n\nNicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the\nmarriage for a year; but Natasha attacked her brother with\nexasperation, proving to him that it could not be otherwise, and\nthat it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the father\'s\nwill, and that she herself wished it so.\n\n\"You don\'t at all understand,\" she said.\n\nNicholas was silent and agreed with her.\n\nHer brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem\nat all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband.\nShe was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This\namazed Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkonski\'s courtship\nskeptically. He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially\nas he had not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him\nthat there was something not quite right about this intended marriage.\n\n\"Why this delay? Why no betrothal?\" he thought. Once, when he had\ntouched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his\nsurprise and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her\nsoul she too had doubts about this marriage.\n\n\"You see he writes,\" said she, showing her son a letter of Prince\nAndrew\'s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a\ndaughter\'s future married happiness, \"he writes that he won\'t come\nbefore December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His\nhealth is very delicate. Don\'t tell Natasha. And don\'t attach\nimportance to her being so bright: that\'s because she\'s living through\nthe last days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every\ntime we receive a letter from him! However, God grant that\neverything turns out well!\" (She always ended with these words.) \"He\nis an excellent man!\"');

To throw\noff this burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his\narrival he went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as\nto where he was going, to Mitenka\'s lodge and demanded an account of\neverything. But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew\neven less than the frightened and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation\nand the examination of the accounts with Mitenka did not last long.\nThe village elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were\nwaiting in the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young\ncount\'s voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and\nthen words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.\n\n\"Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I\'ll hack the dog to pieces! I\'m\nnot my father!... Robbing us!...\" and so on.\n\nThen with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red\nin the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff\nof the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great\nagility at convenient moments between the words, shouting, \"Be off!\nNever let me see your face here again, you villain!\"\n\nMitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the\nshrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for\nculprits at Otradnoe. Mitenka himself, returning tipsy from the\ntown, used to hide there, and many of the residents at Otradnoe,\nhiding from Mitenka, knew of its protective qualities.)\n\nMitenka\'s wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and\nfrightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar\nwas boiling and where the steward\'s high bedstead stood with its\npatchwork quilt.\n\nThe young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by\nwith resolute strides and went into the house.\n\nThe countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened\nat the lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would\ncertainly improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect\nthis excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his\ndoor on tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.\n\nNext day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed\nsmile, said to him:\n\n\"But you know, my dear boy, it\'s a pity you got excited! Mitenka has\ntold me all about it.\"\n\n\"I knew,\" thought Nicholas, \"that I should never understand anything\nin this crazy world.\"\n\n\"You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they\nwere carried forward--and you did not look at the other page.\"\n\n\"Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have\ndone, I have done; but, if you like, I won\'t speak to him again.\"\n\n\"No, my dear boy\" (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he\nhad mismanaged his wife\'s property and was to blame toward his\nchildren, but he did not know how to remedy it). \"No, I beg you to\nattend to the business. I am old. I...\"\n\n\"No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I\nunderstand it all less than you do.\"\n\n\"Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings\nforward from page to page,\" he thought. \"I used to understand what a\n\'corner\' and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to\nanother page I don\'t understand at all,\" said he to himself, and after\nthat he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess\ncalled her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from\nAnna Mikhaylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he\nthought of doing with it.\n\n\"This,\" answered Nicholas. \"You say it rests with me. Well, I\ndon\'t like Anna Mikhaylovna and I don\'t like Boris, but they were\nour friends and poor. Well then, this!\" and he tore up the note, and\nby so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After\nthat, young Rostov took no further part in any business affairs, but\ndevoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new\npursuit--the chase--for which his father kept a large establishment.');

The verdure had\nthickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the\nbrownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle, and\nagainst the pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat. The wooded\nravines and the copses, which at the end of August had still been\ngreen islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden and\nbright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had already\nhalf changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to\nscatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best\ntime of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young\nsportsman Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but\nwere so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give\nthem a three days\' rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go\non a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was\nan undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.\n\nAll that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the\nair was sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began\nto thaw. On the fifteenth, when young Rostov, in his dressing gown,\nlooked out of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for\nhunting: it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth\nwithout any wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping,\nmicroscopic particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the\ngarden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly\nfallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black\nand glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into\nthe dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy\nporch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a\nblack-spotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got\nup on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a\nhare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and\nmustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the\ngarden path, arched his back and, rushing headlong toward the porch\nwith lifted tail, began rubbing himself against his legs.\n\n\"O-hoy!\" came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman\'s call\nwhich unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round\nthe corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,\nwrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian\nfashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence\nand scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his\nCircassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This\nscorn was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,\ndisdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all\nthe same his serf and huntsman.\n\n\"Daniel!\" Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the\nweather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away\nby that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all\nhis previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his\nmistress.\n\n\"What orders, your excellency?\" said the huntsman in his deep\nbass, deep as a proto-deacon\'s and hoarse with hallooing--and two\nflashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who\nwas silent. \"Can you resist it?\" those eyes seemed to be asking.\n\n\"It\'s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?\" asked\nNicholas, scratching Milka behind the ears.\n\nDaniel did not answer, but winked instead.\n\n\"I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen,\" his bass boomed out after a\nminute\'s pause. \"He says she\'s moved them into the Otradnoe enclosure.\nThey were howling there.\" (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom\nthey both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otradnoe copse, a small\nplace a mile and a half from the house.)\n\n\"We ought to go, don\'t you think so?\" said Nicholas. \"Come to me\nwith Uvarka.\"\n\n\"As you please.\"\n\n\"Then put off feeding them.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nFive minutes later Daniel and Uvarka were standing in Nicholas\'\nbig study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was\nlike seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and\nsurroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual\nstood just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for\nfear of breaking something in the master\'s apartment, and he\nhastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that\nceiling, out into the open under the sky once more.\n\nHaving finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion\nthat the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting),\nNicholas ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was\nabout to go Natasha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her\nhair or finished dressing and with her old nurse\'s big shawl wrapped\nround her. Petya ran in at the same time.\n\n\"You are going?\" asked Natasha. \"I knew you would! Sonya said you\nwouldn\'t go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you\ncouldn\'t help going.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are going,\" replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as\nhe intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natasha and\nPetya. \"We are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for\nyou.\"\n\n\"You know it is my greatest pleasure,\" said Natasha. \"It\'s not fair;\nyou are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said\nnothing to us about it.\"\n\n\"\'No barrier bars a Russian\'s path\'--we\'ll go!\" shouted Petya.\n\n\"But you can\'t. Mamma said you mustn\'t,\" said Nicholas to Natasha.\n\n\"Yes, I\'ll go. I shall certainly go,\" said Natasha decisively.\n\"Daniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my\ndogs,\" she added to the huntsman.\n\nIt seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but\nto have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible.\nHe cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his\nbusiness, careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on\nthe young lady.');

He had a look at all the details of\nthe hunt, sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the\nquarry, mounted his chestnut Donets, and whistling to his own leash of\nborzois, set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the\nOtradnoe wood. The old count\'s horse, a sorrel gelding called\nViflyanka, was led by the groom in attendance on him, while the\ncount himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved\nfor him.\n\nThey were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and\nwhippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen and\nmore than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash\nbelonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and\nthirty dogs and twenty horsemen.\n\nEach dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his\nbusiness, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the\nfence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,\nalong the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert.\n\nThe horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and\nthen splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky\nstill seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the\nair was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a\nhuntsman, the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a\nstraggling hound could be heard.\n\nWhen they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders\nwith dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostovs. In\nfront rode a fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray\nmustache.\n\n\"Good morning, Uncle!\" said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.\n\n\"That\'s it.

Shall we join up our packs?\" asked\nNicholas.\n\nThe hounds were joined into one pack, and \"Uncle\" and Nicholas\nrode on side by side. Natasha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide\nher eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed\nby Petya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and\nby a groom appointed to look after her. Petya, who was laughing,\nwhipped and pulled at his horse. Natasha sat easily and confidently on\nher black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.\n\n\"Uncle\" looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha. He did not\nlike to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.\n\n\"Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!\" shouted Petya.\n\n\"Good morning, good morning! But don\'t go overriding the hounds,\"\nsaid \"Uncle\" sternly.\n\n\"Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunila is! He knew me,\" said Natasha,\nreferring to her favorite hound.\n\n\"In the first place, Trunila is not a \'dog,\' but a harrier,\" thought\nNicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel\nthe distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Natasha\nunderstood it.\n\n\"You mustn\'t think we\'ll be in anyone\'s way, Uncle,\" she said.\n\"We\'ll go to our places and won\'t budge.\"\n\n\"A good thing too, little countess,\" said \"Uncle,\" \"only mind you\ndon\'t fall off your horse,\" he added, \"because--that\'s it, come\non!--you\'ve nothing to hold on to.\"\n\nThe oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards\noff, the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rostov, having finally\nsettled with \"Uncle\" where they should set on the hounds, and having\nshown Natasha where she was to stand--a spot where nothing could\npossibly run out--went round above the ravine.\n\n\"Well, nephew, you\'re going for a big wolf,\" said \"Uncle.\" \"Mind and\ndon\'t let her slip!\"\n\n\"That\'s as may happen,\" answered Rostov. \"Karay, here!\" he\nshouted, answering \"Uncle\'s\" remark by this call to his borzoi.\nKaray was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having\ntackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.\n\nThe old count, knowing his son\'s ardor in the hunt, hurried so as\nnot to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when\nCount Ilya Rostov, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove\nup with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for\nhim, where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and\nfastened on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek,\nwell-fed, and comfortable horse, Viflyanka, which was turning gray,\nlike himself. His horses and trap were sent home. Count Ilya Rostov,\nthough not at heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well,\nand rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged\nhis reins, settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was\nready, looked about with a smile.\n\nBeside him was Simon Chekmar, his personal attendant, an old\nhorseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekmar held in leash three\nformidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master\nand his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred\npaces farther along the edge of the wood stood Mitka, the count\'s\nother groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the\nhunt, by old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled\nbrandy, taken a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his\nfavorite Bordeaux.\n\nHe was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were\nrather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his\nsaddle, wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out\nfor an outing.\n\nThe thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmar, having got everything ready,\nkept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of\nterms for thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in\nexpected a pleasant chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through\nthe wood (it was plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind\nthe count. This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman\'s\ncloak, with a tall peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who\nwent by a woman\'s name, Nastasya Ivanovna.\n\n\"Well, Nastasya Ivanovna!\" whispered the count, winking at him.\n\"If you scare away the beast, Daniel\'ll give it you!\"\n\n\"I know a thing or two myself!\" said Nastasya Ivanovna.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered the count and turned to Simon. \"Have you seen\nthe young countess?\" he asked. \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"With young Count Peter, by the Zharov rank grass,\" answered\nSimon, smiling. \"Though she\'s a lady, she\'s very fond of hunting.\"\n\n\"And you\'re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?\" said the\ncount. \"She\'s as good as many a man!\"\n\n\"Of course! It\'s marvelous. So bold, so easy!\"\n\n\"And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyadov upland, isn\'t he?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so\nwell that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,\" said Simon, well\nknowing what would please his master.\n\n\"Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?\"\n\n\"A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the\nZavarzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight\nwhen they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand\nrubles and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search\nfar to find another as smart.\"\n\n\"To search far...\" repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not\nsaid more. \"To search far,\" he said, turning back the skirt of his\ncoat to get at his snuffbox.\n\n\"The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael\nSidorych...\" Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had\ndistinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three\nhounds giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a\nwarning finger at his master. \"They are on the scent of the cubs...\"\nhe whispered, \"straight to the Lyadov uplands.\"\n\nThe count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked\ninto the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space,\nholding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry\nof the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel\'s\nhunting horn; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be\nheard in full cry, with that peculiar lift in the note that\nindicates that they are after a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on\nthe hounds, but changed to the cry of ulyulyu, and above the others\nrose Daniel\'s voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice\nseemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open\nfield.\n\nAfter listening a few moments in silence, the count and his\nattendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into\ntwo packs: the sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue,\nbegan to die away in the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood\npast the count, and it was with this that Daniel\'s voice was heard\ncalling ulyulyu. The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart\nagain, but both were becoming more distant.\n\nSimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi\nhad entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in\nhis hand, opened it and took a pinch. \"Back!\" cried Simon to a\nborzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and\ndropped the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted to pick it up.\nThe count and Simon were looking at him.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly\napproached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were\njust in front of them.\n\nThe count turned and saw on his right Mitka staring at him with eyes\nstarting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to\nthe other side.\n\n\"Look out!\" he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had\nlong fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he\ngalloped toward the count.\n\nThe count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a\nwolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet\nlope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.\nThe angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the\nhorses\' feet at the wolf.\n\nThe wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs\nawkwardly, like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly\nswaying from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish\nof its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same\ninstant, with a cry like a wail, first one hound, then another, and\nthen another, sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the\nwhole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf\nhad disappeared. The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and\nDaniel\'s chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long back\nsat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his disheveled gray hair hanging\nover his flushed, perspiring face.\n\n\"Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...\" he cried. When he caught sight of the\ncount his eyes flashed lightning.\n\n\"Blast you!\" he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the\ncount.\n\n\"You\'ve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!\" and as if scorning to\nsay more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving\nflanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count\nhad aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a\npunished schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon\'s\nsympathy for his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was\ngalloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both\nsides, all trying to head the wolf, but it vanished into the wood\nbefore they could do so.');

By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of\nthe dogs whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of\nthe huntsmen approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was\nhappening at the copse. He knew that young and old wolves were\nthere, that the hounds had separated into two packs, that somewhere\na wolf was being chased, and that something had gone wrong. He\nexpected the wolf to come his way any moment. He made thousands of\ndifferent conjectures as to where and from what side the beast would\ncome and how he would set upon it. Hope alternated with despair.\nSeveral times he addressed a prayer to God that the wolf should come\nhis way. He prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with\nwhich men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial\ncauses. \"What would it be to Thee to do this for me?\" he said to\nGod. \"I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee,\nbut for God\'s sake do let the old wolf come my way and let Karay\nspring at it--in sight of \'Uncle\' who is watching from over there--and\nseize it by the throat in a death grip!\" A thousand times during\nthat half-hour Rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of\nthe wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth\nand the gully with its water-worn side and \"Uncle\'s\" cap just\nvisible above the bush on his right.\n\n\"No, I shan\'t have such luck,\" thought Rostov, \"yet what wouldn\'t it\nbe worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am\nalways unlucky.\" Memories of Austerlitz and of Dolokhov flashed\nrapidly and clearly through his mind. \"Only once in my life to get\nan old wolf, I want only that!\" thought he, straining eyes and ears\nand looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the\nslightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.\n\nAgain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him\nacross the deserted field. \"No, it can\'t be!\" thought Rostov, taking a\ndeep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped\nfor. The height of happiness was reached--and so simply, without\nwarning, or noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his\neyes and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and\njumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path. She was an old\nanimal with a gray back and big reddish belly. She ran without\nhurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw her. Rostov, holding his\nbreath, looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay not seeing\nthe wolf or understanding the situation. Old Karay had turned his head\nand was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and\nsnapping at his hind legs.\n\n\"Ulyulyulyu!\" whispered Rostov, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped\nup, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Karay\nfinished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up\nwith quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.\n\n\"Shall I loose them or not?\" Nicholas asked himself as the wolf\napproached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf\'s whole\nphysiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never\nseen before--human eyes fixed upon her--and turning her head a\nlittle toward Rostov, she paused.\n\n\"Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...\" the wolf seemed to\nsay to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round\nand with a quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.\n\n\"Ulyulyu!\" cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own\naccord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies\nto head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.\nNicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping,\nnor see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only\nthe wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same\ndirection along the hollow. The first to come into view was Milka,\nwith her black markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the\nwolf. Nearer and nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf\nturned its head to face her, and instead of putting on speed as she\nusually did Milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.\n\n\"Ulyulyulyulyu!\" shouted Nicholas.\n\nThe reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka, sprang\nimpetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but\nimmediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her\nteeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of\na couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to\nher.\n\n\"She\'ll get away! No, it\'s impossible!\" thought Nicholas, still\nshouting with a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Karay, ulyulyu!...\" he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi\nwho was now his only hope. Karay, with all the strength age had left\nhim, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf,\ngalloped heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the\nwolf\'s lope and the borzoi\'s slower pace made it plain that Karay\nhad miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of\nhim the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach\nit. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping\nalmost straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish\nyoung borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed\nimpetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But\nthe wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,\ngnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a\npiercing yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a\ngash in its side.\n\n\"Karay? Old fellow!...\" wailed Nicholas.\n\nThanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf\'s path,\nthe old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within\nfive paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her\neyes on Karay, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and\nincreased her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something\nhappened to Karay--the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they\nrolled together down into a gully just in front of them.\n\nThat instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully\nwith the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and\noutstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears\nlaid back (Karay was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest\nmoment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to\ndismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up\nfrom among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge\nof the gully. She clicked her teeth (Karay no longer had her by the\nthroat), leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and\nhaving disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again,\nwent forward. Karay, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or\nwounded, climbed with difficulty out of the gully.\n\n\"Oh my God! Why?\" Nicholas cried in despair.\n\n\"Uncle\'s\" huntsman was galloping from the other side across the\nwolf\'s path and his borzois once more stopped the animal\'s advance.\nShe was again hemmed in.\n\nNicholas and his attendant, with \"Uncle\" and his huntsman, were\nall riding round the wolf, crying \"ulyulyu!\" shouting and preparing to\ndismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward\nagain every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she\nwould be safe.\n\nAlready, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the\nulyulyuing, had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karay seize the wolf,\nand checked his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he\nsaw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself\nand ran for safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf\nbut straight toward the wood, just as Karay had run to cut the\nanimal off. As a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just\nwhen she had been stopped a second time by \"Uncle\'s\" borzois.\n\nDaniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand\nand thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip\nas if it were a flail.\n\nNicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut,\nbreathing heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body\nand saw Daniel lying on the wolf\'s back among the dogs, trying to\nseize her by the ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to\nthe wolf herself that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed\nback her ears and tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her.\nDaniel rose a little, took a step, and with his whole weight, as if\nlying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by the ears.\nNicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, \"Don\'t! We\'ll\ngag her!\" and, changing his position, set his foot on the wolf\'s neck.\nA stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash,\nas if bridled, her legs were bound together, and Daniel rolled her\nover once or twice from side to side.\n\nWith happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a\nshying and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her,\ntook her to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had\nkilled two of the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled\nwith their booty and their stories, and all came to look at the\nwolf, which, with her broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten\nstick between her jaws, gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd\nof dogs and men surrounding her. When she was touched, she jerked\nher bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody. Old Count\nRostov also rode up and touched the wolf.\n\n\"Oh, what a formidable one!\" said he. \"A formidable one, eh?\" he\nasked Daniel, who was standing near.\n\n\"Yes, your excellency,\" answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.\n\nThe count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with\nDaniel.\n\n\"Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!\" said the count.\n\nFor sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable\nsmile.');

At\nmidday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with\nyoung trees. Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his\nwhips.\n\nFacing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood\nalone in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been\nloosed before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltorn, giving tongue at\nintervals; other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving\ntongue. A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a\nfox had been found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along\nthe ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.\n\nHe saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the\nravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself\nat any moment on the ryefield opposite.\n\nThe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois,\nand Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going\nhard across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew\nclose to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and\nsharper curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white\nborzoi dashed in followed by a black one, and everything was in\nconfusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying\ntheir bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the\ngroup. Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in a red cap, the\nother, a stranger, in a green coat.\n\n\"What\'s this?\" thought Nicholas. \"Where\'s that huntsman from? He\nis not \'Uncle\'s\' man.\"\n\nThe huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without\nstrapping it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high\nsaddles, stood near them and there too the dogs were lying. The\nhuntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox. Then from that\nspot came the sound of a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of\na fight.\n\n\"That\'s Ilagin\'s huntsman having a row with our Ivan,\" said\nNicholas\' groom.\n\nNicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to him, and rode\nat a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds\ntogether. Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight\nwas going on.\n\nNicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and Petya, who had ridden\nup, stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would\nend. Out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and\nrode toward his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper.\nWhile still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak\nrespectfully, but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry.\nOne of his eyes was black, but he probably was not even aware of it.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Nicholas.\n\n\"A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my\ngray bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the\nfox! I gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want\na taste of this?...\" said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and\nprobably imagining himself still speaking to his foe.\n\nNicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and\nPetya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy\'s,\nIlagin\'s, hunting party was.\n\nThe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,\nsurrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.\n\nThe facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel\nand were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the\nRostovs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very\nwoods the Rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs\nhad chased.\n\nNicholas, though he had never seen Ilagin, with his usual absence of\nmoderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his\narbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe.\nHe rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and\nfully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish\nhis enemy.\n\nHardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman\nin a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black\nhorse, accompanied by two hunt servants.\n\nInstead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and\ncourteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young\ncount\'s acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilagin raised\nhis beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and\nwould have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox\nhunted by someone else\'s borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted\nwith the count and invited him to draw his covert.\n\nNatasha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had\nfollowed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging\nfriendly greetings, she rode up to them. Ilagin lifted his beaver\ncap still higher to Natasha and said, with a pleasant smile, that\nthe young countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as\nwell as in her beauty, of which he had heard much.\n\nTo expiate his huntsman\'s offense, Ilagin pressed the Rostovs to\ncome to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for\nhimself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and\nthe hunt, now doubled, moved on.\n\nThe way to Iligin\'s upland was across the fields. The hunt\nservants fell into line. The masters rode together. \"Uncle,\" Rostov,\nand Ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one another\'s dogs, trying\nnot to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for\nrivals to their own borzois.\n\nRostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small,\npure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Ilagin\'s leash, slender but with\nmuscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He\nhad heard of the swiftness of Ilagin\'s borzois, and in that\nbeautiful bitch saw a rival to his own Milka.\n\nIn the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilagin about the\nyear\'s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.\n\n\"A fine little bitch, that!\" said he in a careless tone. \"Is she\nswift?\"\n\n\"That one? Yes, she\'s a good dog, gets what she\'s after,\" answered\nIlagin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erza, for which, a year\nbefore, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. \"So\nin your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?\" he\nwent on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And considering\nit polite to return the young count\'s compliment, Ilagin looked at his\nborzois and picked out Milka who attracted his attention by her\nbreadth. \"That black-spotted one of yours is fine--well shaped!\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Yes, she\'s fast enough,\" replied Nicholas, and thought: \"If only\na full-grown hare would cross the field now I\'d show you what sort\nof borzoi she is,\" and turning to his groom, he said he would give a\nruble to anyone who found a hare.\n\n\"I don\'t understand,\" continued Ilagin, \"how some sportsmen can be\nso jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count, I\nenjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?\" (he\nagain raised his cap to Natasha) \"but as for counting skins and what\none takes, I don\'t care about that.\"\n\n\"Of course not!\"\n\n\"Or being upset because someone else\'s borzoi and not mine catches\nsomething. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not\nso, Count? For I consider that...\"\n\n\"A-tu!\" came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,\nwho had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip\naloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, \"A-tu!\" (This call and\nthe uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)\n\n\"Ah, he has found one, I think,\" said Ilagin carelessly. \"Yes, we\nmust ride up.... Shall we both course it?\" answered Nicholas, seeing\nin Erza and \"Uncle\'s\" red Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a\nchance of pitting against his own borzois. \"And suppose they outdo\nmy Milka at once!\" he thought as he rode with \"Uncle\" and Ilagin\ntoward the hare.\n\n\"A full-grown one?\" asked Ilagin as he approached the whip who had\nsighted the hare--and not without agitation he looked round and\nwhistled to Erza.\n\n\"And you, Michael Nikanorovich?\" he said, addressing \"Uncle.\"\n\nThe latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.\n\n\"How can I join in? Why, you\'ve given a village for each of your\nborzois! That\'s it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours\nagainst one another, you two, and I\'ll look on!\"\n\n\"Rugay, hey, hey!\" he shouted. \"Rugayushka!\" he added, involuntarily\nby this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on\nthis red borzoi. Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly\nmen and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by\nit.\n\nThe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and\nthe gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were\nfar off on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but\nnot the gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and\nsedately.\n\n\"How is it pointing?\" asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces\ntoward the whip who had sighted the hare.\n\nBut before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming\nnext morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash\nrushed downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the\nborzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare.\nAll the hunt, who had been moving slowly, shouted, \"Stop!\" calling\nin the hounds, while the borzoi whips, with a cry of \"A-tu!\" galloped\nacross the field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilagin,\nNicholas, Natasha, and \"Uncle\" flew, reckless of where and how they\nwent, seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose\nsight even for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started\nwas a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at\nonce, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling\nthat resounded from all sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not\nvery quickly, letting the borzois gain on him, and, finally having\nchosen his direction and realized his danger, laid back his ears and\nrushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble, but in front of\nhim was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft. The two borzois\nof the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the nearest, were the\nfirst to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far before Ilagin\'s\nred-spotted Erza passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare\nwith terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had\nseized him, rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his back and\nbounded off yet more swiftly. From behind Erza rushed the\nbroad-haunched, black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the\nhare.\n\n\"Milashka, dear!\" rose Nicholas\' triumphant cry. It looked as if\nMilka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and\nflew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erza reached\nhim, but when close to the hare\'s scut paused as if measuring the\ndistance, so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind\nleg.\n\n\"Erza, darling!\" Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erza did\nnot hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have\nseized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between\nthe winter rye and the stubble. Again Erza and Milka were abreast,\nrunning like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the\nhare, but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the\nborzois did not overtake him so quickly.\n\n\"Rugay, Rugayushka! That\'s it, come on!\" came a third voice just\nthen, and \"Uncle\'s\" red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught\nup with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of\nthe terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off\nthe balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,\nsinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was\nhow, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of\nborzois surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the\ncrowd of dogs. Only the delighted \"Uncle\" dismounted, and cut off a\npad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously\nglancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He\nspoke without himself knowing whom to or what about. \"That\'s it,\ncome on! That\'s a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the\nthousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That\'s it, come\non!\" said he, panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were\nabusing someone, as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him,\nand only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself. \"There\nare your thousand-ruble ones.... That\'s it, come on!...\"\n\n\"Rugay, here\'s a pad for you!\" he said, throwing down the hare\'s\nmuddy pad. \"You\'ve deserved it, that\'s it, come on!\"\n\n\"She\'d tired herself out, she\'d run it down three times by herself,\"\nsaid Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of\nwhether he were heard or not.\n\n\"But what is there in running across it like that?\" said Ilagin\'s\ngroom.\n\n\"Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take\nit,\" Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop\nand his excitement. At the same moment Natasha, without drawing\nbreath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set\neveryone\'s ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the\nothers expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that\nshe must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone\nelse would have been amazed at it at any other time. \"Uncle\" himself\ntwisted up the hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horse\'s\nback as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with\nan air of not wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode\noff. The others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much\nlater were they able to regain their former affectation of\nindifference. For a long time they continued to look at red Rugay who,\nhis arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash,\nwalked along just behind \"Uncle\'s\" horse with the serene air of a\nconqueror.\n\n\"Well, I am like any other dog as long as it\'s not a question of\ncoursing. But when it is, then look out!\" his appearance seemed to\nNicholas to be saying.\n\nWhen, much later, \"Uncle\" rode up to Nicholas and began talking to\nhim, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, \"Uncle\"\ndeigned to speak to him.');

That\'s it,\ncome on!\" said \"Uncle.\" \"You see it\'s damp weather, and you could\nrest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.\"\n\n\"Uncle\'s\" offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for\na trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to \"Uncle\'s\" house.\n\nSome five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front\nporch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as\nwell as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at\nthe hunters who were arriving. The presence of Natasha--a woman, a\nlady, and on horseback--raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a\ndegree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and\nunabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were\nsome prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand\nwhat was said about her.\n\n\"Arinka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt\ndangles.... See, she\'s got a little hunting horn!\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious! See her knife?...\"\n\n\"Isn\'t she a Tartar!\"\n\n\"How is it you didn\'t go head over heels?\" asked the boldest of all,\naddressing Natasha directly.\n\n\"Uncle\" dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which\nstood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his\nretainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should\ntake themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made\nto receive the guests and the visitors.\n\nThe serfs all dispersed. \"Uncle\" lifted Natasha off her horse and\ntaking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch.\nThe house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean--it\ndid not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless--but\nneither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of\nfresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.\n\n\"Uncle\" led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with\na folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a\nround birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room\nwhere there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of\nSuvorov, of the host\'s father and mother, and of himself in military\nuniform. The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. \"Uncle\" asked\nhis visitors to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went\nout of the room. Rugay, his back still muddy, came into the room and\nlay down on the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth.\nLeading from the study was a passage in which a partition with\nragged curtains could be seen. From behind this came women\'s\nlaughter and whispers. Natasha, Nicholas, and Petya took off their\nwraps and sat down on the sofa. Petya, leaning on his elbow, fell\nasleep at once. Natasha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces\nglowed, they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another\n(now that the hunt was over and they were in the house, Nicholas no\nlonger considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over\nhis sister), Natasha gave him a wink, and neither refrained long\nfrom bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a\npretext ready to account for it.\n\nAfter a while \"Uncle\" came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and\nsmall top boots. And Natasha felt that this costume, the very one\nshe had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe, was just the\nright thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.\n\"Uncle\" too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the\nbrother\'s and sister\'s laughter (it could never enter his head that\nthey might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the\nmerriment.\n\n\"That\'s right, young countess, that\'s it, come on! I never saw\nanyone like her!\" said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem\nand, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another\nthat had been cut short. \"She\'s ridden all day like a man, and is as\nfresh as ever!\"\n\nSoon after \"Uncle\'s\" reappearance the door was opened, evidently\nfrom the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking\nwoman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered\ncarrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality\nin her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and,\nwith a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional\nstoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and\nthrow back her head, this woman (who was \"Uncle\'s\" housekeeper) trod\nvery lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her\nplump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors\nd\'oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had\nfinished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on\nher face. \"Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand \'Uncle\'?\" her\nexpression said to Rostov. How could one help understanding? Not\nonly Nicholas, but even Natasha understood the meaning of his puckered\nbrow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips\nwhen Anisya Fedorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb\nwine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with\nbuttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead,\napples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards\nshe brought a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey,\nand preserves made with sugar.\n\nAll this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna\'s housekeeping,\ngathered and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a\nsmack of Anisya Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness,\ncleanliness, whiteness, and pleasant smiles.\n\n\"Take this, little Lady-Countess!\" she kept saying, as she offered\nNatasha first one thing and then another.\n\nNatasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten\nsuch buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets,\nor such a chicken anywhere. Anisya Fedorovna left the room.\n\nAfter supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostov and \"Uncle\" talked of\npast and future hunts, of Rugay and Ilagin\'s dogs, while Natasha sat\nupright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried\nseveral times to wake Petya that he might eat something, but he only\nmuttered incoherent words without waking up. Natasha felt so\nlighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only\nfeared the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause,\nsuch as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in\none\'s own house, \"Uncle,\" answering a thought that was in his\nvisitors\' mind, said:\n\n\"This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.\nThat\'s it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?\"\n\n\"Uncle\'s\" face was very significant and even handsome as he said\nthis. Involuntarily Rostov recalled all the good he had heard about\nhim from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province\n\"Uncle\" had the reputation of being the most honorable and\ndisinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,\nchose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a\njustice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused\npublic appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on\nhis bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown\ngarden in summer.\n\n\"Why don\'t you enter the service, Uncle?\"\n\n\"I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That\'s it, come\non! I can\'t make head or tail of it. That\'s for you--I haven\'t\nbrains enough. Now, hunting is another matter--that\'s it, come on!\nOpen the door, there!\" he shouted. \"Why have you shut it?\"\n\nThe door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen\'s room, as\nthey called the room for the hunt servants.\n\nThere was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the\ndoor into the huntsmen\'s room, from which came the clear sounds of a\nbalalayka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was\nplaying. Natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and\nnow went out into the passage to hear better.\n\n\"That\'s Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balalayka.\nI\'m fond of it,\" said \"Uncle.\"\n\nIt was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the\nhuntsmen\'s room when \"Uncle\" returned from the chase. \"Uncle\" was fond\nof such music.\n\n\"How good! Really very good!\" said Nicholas with some\nunintentional superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the\nsounds pleased him very much.\n\n\"Very good?\" said Natasha reproachfully, noticing her brother\'s\ntone. \"Not \'very good\' it\'s simply delicious!\"\n\nJust as \"Uncle\'s\" pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had\nseemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that\nmoment, seemed to her the acme of musical delight.\n\n\"More, please, more!\" cried Natasha at the door as soon as the\nbalalayka ceased. Mitka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the\nbalalayka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. \"Uncle\"\nsat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air\nwas repeated a hundred times. The balalayka was retuned several\ntimes and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did\nnot grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. Anisya\nFedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.\n\n\"You like listening?\" she said to Natasha, with a smile extremely\nlike \"Uncle\'s.\" \"That\'s a good player of ours,\" she added.\n\n\"He doesn\'t play that part right!\" said \"Uncle\" suddenly, with an\nenergetic gesture. \"Here he ought to burst out--that\'s it, come\non!--ought to burst out.\"\n\n\"Do you play then?\" asked Natasha.\n\n\"Uncle\" did not answer, but smiled.\n\n\"Anisya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I\nhaven\'t touched it for a long time. That\'s it--come on! I\'ve given\nit up.\"\n\nAnisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her\nerrand and brought back the guitar.\n\nWithout looking at anyone, \"Uncle\" blew the dust off it and, tapping\nthe case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself\nin his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard,\narching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a\nwink at Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous,\nand then quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow\ntime, not My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the\nstreet. The tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to\nthrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natasha, arousing in them the\nsame kind of sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna\'s whole\nbeing. Anisya Fedorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her\nface went laughing out of the room. \"Uncle\" continued to play\ncorrectly, carefully, with energetic firmness, looking with a\nchanged and inspired expression at the spot where Anisya Fedorovna had\njust stood. Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of\nhis face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song grew brisker\nand the time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his fingers\nover the strings, something seemed to snap.\n\n\"Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!\" shouted Natasha as soon as he\nhad finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. \"Nicholas,\nNicholas!\" she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: \"What\nis it moves me so?\"\n\nNicholas too was greatly pleased by \"Uncle\'s\" playing, and \"Uncle\"\nplayed the piece over again. Anisya Fedorovna\'s smiling face\nreappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...\n\n    Fetching water clear and sweet,\n    Stop, dear maiden, I entreat--\n\nplayed \"Uncle\" once more, running his fingers skillfully over the\nstrings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.\n\n\"Go on, Uncle dear,\" Natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her\nlife depended on it.\n\n\"Uncle\" rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of\nthem smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow\nstruck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.\n\n\"Now then, niece!\" he exclaimed, waving to Natasha the hand that had\njust struck a chord.\n\nNatasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to\nface \"Uncle,\" and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with\nher shoulders and struck an attitude.\n\nWhere, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an emigree\nFrench governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that\nspirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale* would, one\nwould have supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the\nmovements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that\n\"Uncle\" had expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and\nsmiled triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that\nhad at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do\nthe right thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.\n\n\n*The French shawl dance.\n\n\nShe did the right thing with such precision, such complete\nprecision, that Anisya Fedorovna, who had at once handed her the\nhandkerchief she needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though\nshe laughed as she watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in\nsilks and velvets and so different from herself, who yet was able to\nunderstand all that was in Anisya and in Anisya\'s father and mother\nand aunt, and in every Russian man and woman.\n\n\"Well, little countess; that\'s it--come on!\" cried \"Uncle,\" with a\njoyous laugh, having finished the dance. \"Well done, niece! Now a fine\nyoung fellow must be found as husband for you. That\'s it--come on!\"\n\n\"He\'s chosen already,\" said Nicholas smiling.\n\n\"Oh?\" said \"Uncle\" in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natasha,\nwho nodded her head with a happy smile.\n\n\"And such a one!\" she said. But as soon as she had said it a new\ntrain of thoughts and feelings arose in her. \"What did Nicholas\' smile\nmean when he said \'chosen already\'? Is he glad of it or not? It is\nas if he thought my Bolkonski would not approve of or understand our\ngaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?\" she thought,\nand her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a second.\n\"Don\'t dare to think about it,\" she said to herself, and sat down\nagain smilingly beside \"Uncle,\" begging him to play something more.\n\n\"Uncle\" played another song and a valse; then after a pause he\ncleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:\n\n    As \'twas growing dark last night\n    Fell the snow so soft and light...\n\n\n\"Uncle\" sang as peasants sing, with full and naive conviction that\nthe whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune\ncomes of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which\nexists only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the\nunconsidered tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily\ngood. Natasha was in ecstasies over \"Uncle\'s\" singing. She resolved to\ngive up learning the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked\n\"Uncle\" for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song.\n\nAfter nine o\'clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been\nsent to look for them, arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya. The count\nand countess did not know where they were and were very anxious,\nsaid one of the men.\n\nPetya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two\ntraps. Natasha and Nicholas got into the other. \"Uncle\" wrapped\nNatasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness.\nHe accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be\ncrossed, so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent\nhuntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.\n\n\"Good-by, dear niece,\" his voice called out of the darkness--not the\nvoice Natasha had known previously, but the one that had sung As \'twas\ngrowing dark last night.\n\nIn the village through which they passed there were red lights and a\ncheerful smell of smoke.\n\n\"What a darling Uncle is!\" said Natasha, when they had come out onto\nthe highroad.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Nicholas. \"You\'re not cold?\"\n\n\"No. I\'m quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!\" answered\nNatasha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long\nwhile. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but\nonly heard them splashing through the unseen mud.\n\nWhat was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly\ncaught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did\nthey all find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were\nnearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As \'twas growing dark\nlast night--the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get\nand had at last caught.\n\n\"Got it?\" said Nicholas.\n\n\"What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?\" inquired Natasha.\n\nThey were fond of asking one another that question.\n\n\"I?\" said Nicholas, trying to remember. \"Well, you see, first I\nthought that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were\na man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then\nfor his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don\'t you think so?...\nWell, and you?\"\n\n\"I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving\nalong and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows\nwhere we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive\nand suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe, but in Fairyland. And\nthen I thought... No, nothing else.\"\n\n\"I know, I expect you thought of him,\" said Nicholas, smiling as\nNatasha knew by the sound of his voice.\n\n\"No,\" said Natasha, though she had in reality been thinking about\nPrince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would\nhave liked \"Uncle.\" \"And then I was saying to myself all the way, \'How\nwell Anisya carried herself, how well!\'\" And Nicholas heard her\nspontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. \"And do you know,\" she\nsuddenly said, \"I know that I shall never again be as happy and\ntranquil as I am now.\"\n\n\"Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!\" exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:\n\"How charming this Natasha of mine is! I have no other friend like her\nand never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive\nabout together!\"\n\n\"What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!\" thought Natasha.\n\n\"Ah, there are still lights in the drawingroom!\" she said,\npointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the\nmoist velvety darkness of the night.');

Natasha and Nicholas often noticed their parents\nconferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of\nselling the fine ancestral Rostov house and estate near Moscow. It was\nnot necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been\nMarshal, and life at Otradnoe was quieter than in former years, but\nstill the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more\nthan twenty sat down to table every day. These were all their own\npeople who had settled down in the house almost as members of the\nfamily, or persons who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the count\'s\nhouse. Such were Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing\nmaster and his family, Belova, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the\nhouse, and many others such as Petya\'s tutors, the girls\' former\ngoverness, and other people who simply found it preferable and more\nadvantageous to live in the count\'s house than at home. They had not\nas many visitors as before, but the old habits of life without which\nthe count and countess could not conceive of existence remained\nunchanged. There was still the hunting establishment which Nicholas\nhad even enlarged, the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the\nstables, the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole\ndistrict on name days; there were still the count\'s games of whist and\nboston, at which--spreading out his cards so that everybody could see\nthem--he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by\nhis neighbors, who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with\nCount Rostov as a most profitable source of income.\n\nThe count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to\nbelieve that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every\nstep, and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work\ncarefully and patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her\nloving heart, felt that her children were being ruined, that it was\nnot the count\'s fault for he could not help being what he was--that\n(though he tried to hide it) he himself suffered from the\nconsciousness of his own and his children\'s ruin, and she tried to\nfind means of remedying the position. From her feminine point of\nview she could see only one solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry\na rich heiress. She felt this to be their last hope and that if\nNicholas refused the match she had found for him, she would have to\nabandon the hope of ever getting matters right. This match was with\nJulie Karagina, the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents, a girl\nthe Rostovs had known from childhood, and who had now become a wealthy\nheiress through the death of the last of her brothers.\n\nThe countess had written direct to Julie\'s mother in Moscow\nsuggesting a marriage between their children and had received a\nfavorable answer from her. Karagina had replied that for her part\nshe was agreeable, and everything depend on her daughter\'s\ninclination. She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow.\n\nSeveral times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son\nthat now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him\nmarried. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that\nwere accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid\ngirl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.\n\nAt other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to\nMoscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his\nmother\'s remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations\ninduced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope of\ngetting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie\nKaragina.\n\n\"But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would you\nexpect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of\nmoney?\" he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question\nand only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.\n\n\"No, you have not understood me,\" said his mother, not knowing how\nto justify herself. \"You have not understood me, Nikolenka. It is your\nhappiness I wish for,\" she added, feeling that she was telling an\nuntruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.\n\n\"Mamma, don\'t cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I\nwill give my life, anything, to put you at ease,\" said Nicholas. \"I\nwould sacrifice anything for you--even my feelings.\"\n\nBut the countess did not want the question put like that: she did\nnot want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a\nsacrifice for him.\n\n\"No, you have not understood me, don\'t let us talk about it,\" she\nreplied, wiping away her tears.\n\n\"Maybe I do love a poor girl,\" said Nicholas to himself. \"Am I to\nsacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could\nspeak so to me. Because Sonya is poor I must not love her,\" he\nthought, \"must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should\ncertainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can\nalways sacrifice my feelings for my family\'s welfare,\" he said to\nhimself, \"but I can\'t coerce my feelings. If I love Sonya, that\nfeeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.\"\n\nNicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the\nconversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and\nsometimes with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment\nbetween her son and the portionless Sonya. Though she blamed herself\nfor it, she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sonya,\noften pulling her up without reason, addressing her stiffly as \"my\ndear,\" and using the formal \"you\" instead of the intimate \"thou\" in\nspeaking to her. The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with\nSonya because that poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind,\nso devotedly grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully,\nunchangingly, and unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were\nno grounds for finding fault with her.\n\nNicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter\nhad come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he\nwould have been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound\nunexpectedly reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to\ndefer his return till the beginning of the new year. Natasha was still\nas much in love with her betrothed, found the same comfort in that\nlove, and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures\nof life as before; but at the end of the fourth month of their\nseparation she began to have fits of depression which she could not\nmaster. She felt sorry for herself: sorry that she was being wasted\nall this time and of no use to anyone--while she felt herself so\ncapable of loving and being loved.\n\nThings were not cheerful in the Rostovs\' home.');

It was the dullest\ntime of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that\nmorning, was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was\nresting in his study. Sonya sat in the drawing room at the round\ntable, copying a design for embroidery. The countess was playing\npatience. Nastasya Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the\nwindow with two old ladies. Natasha came into the room, went up to\nSonya, glanced at what she was doing, and then went up to her mother\nand stood without speaking.\n\n\"Why are you wandering about like an outcast?\" asked her mother.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!\" said Natasha,\nwith glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.\n\nThe countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.\n\n\"Don\'t look at me, Mamma! Don\'t look; I shall cry directly.\"\n\n\"Sit down with me a little,\" said the countess.\n\n\"Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?\"\n\nHer voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned\nquickly to hide them and left the room.\n\nShe passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and\nthen went into the maids\' room. There an old maidservant was grumbling\nat a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold\nfrom the serfs\' quarters.\n\n\"Stop playing--there\'s a time for everything,\" said the old woman.\n\n\"Let her alone, Kondratevna,\" said Natasha. \"Go, Mavrushka, go.\"\n\nHaving released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went\nto the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing\ncards. They broke off and rose as she entered.\n\n\"What can I do with them?\" thought Natasha.\n\n\"Oh, Nikita, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the\nyard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some\noats.\"\n\n\"Just a few oats?\" said Misha, cheerfully and readily.\n\n\"Go, go quickly,\" the old man urged him.\n\n\"And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.\"\n\nOn her way past the butler\'s pantry she told them to set a\nsamovar, though it was not at all the time for tea.\n\nFoka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.\nNatasha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order\nand asked whether the samovar was really wanted.\n\n\"Oh dear, what a young lady!\" said Foka, pretending to frown at\nNatasha.\n\nNo one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble\nas Natasha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to\nsend them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of\nthem would get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no\none\'s orders so readily as they did hers. \"What can I do, where can\nI go?\" thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.\n\n\"Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?\" she asked\nthe buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman\'s jacket.\n\n\"Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,\" answered the buffoon.\n\n\"O Lord, O Lord, it\'s always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am\nI to do with myself?\" And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly\nupstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.\n\nTwo governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which\nwere plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were\ndiscussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natasha\nsat down, listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air,\nand then got up again.\n\n\"The island of Madagascar,\" she said, \"Ma-da-gas-car,\" she repeated,\narticulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame\nSchoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.\n\nHer brother Petya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on\nhim he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.\n\n\"Petya! Petya!\" she called to him. \"Carry me downstairs.\"\n\nPetya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her\narms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.\n\n\"No, don\'t... the island of Madagascar!\" she said, and jumping off\nhis back she went downstairs.\n\nHaving as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made\nsure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was\ndull, Natasha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar,\nsat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her\nfingers over the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she\nrecalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew.\nWhat she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other\nlisteners, but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences\narose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes\nfixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and\nlistened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on\nthe past.\n\nSonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha glanced\nat her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her\nthat she remembered the light falling through that crack once before\nand Sonya passing with a glass in her hand. \"Yes it was exactly the\nsame,\" thought Natasha.\n\n\"Sonya, what is this?\" she cried, twanging a thick string.\n\n\"Oh, you are there!\" said Sonya with a start, and came near and\nlistened. \"I don\'t know. A storm?\" she ventured timidly, afraid of\nbeing wrong.\n\n\"There! That\'s just how she started and just how she came up smiling\ntimidly when all this happened before,\" thought Natasha, \"and in\njust the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.\"\n\n\"No, it\'s the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!\" and Natasha\nsang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it. \"Where\nwere you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.\"\n\n\"You always find something to do, but I can\'t,\" said Natasha. \"And\nwhere\'s Nicholas?\"\n\n\"Asleep, I think.\"\n\n\"Sonya, go and wake him,\" said Natasha. \"Tell him I want him to come\nand sing.\"\n\nShe sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened\nbefore could be, and without solving this problem, or at all\nregretting not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time\nwhen she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover\'s eyes.\n\n\"Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!\nAnd, worst of all, I am growing old--that\'s the thing! There won\'t\nthen be in me what there is now. But perhaps he\'ll come today, will\ncome immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing\nroom. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.\" She rose,\nput down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.\n\nAll the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were\nalready at the tea table. The servants stood round the table--but\nPrince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before.\n\n\"Ah, here she is!\" said the old count, when he saw Natasha enter.\n\"Well, sit down by me.\" But Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced\nround as if looking for something.\n\n\"Mamma!\" she muttered, \"give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,\nquickly!\" and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.\n\nShe sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between\nthe elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. \"My God, my\nGod! The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing\nin the same way!\" thought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense of\nrepulsion rising up in her for the whole household, because they\nwere always the same.\n\nAfter tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting room, to\ntheir favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.');

And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?\"\n\n\"I should think so!\" he replied. \"I have felt like that when\neverything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has\ncome into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must\nall die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where\nthere was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!\" Natasha interrupted him. \"When I\nwas quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I\nwas punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat\nsobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and\nsorry for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was\ninnocent--that was the chief thing,\" said Natasha. \"Do you remember?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" answered Nicholas. \"I remember that I came to you\nafterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt\nashamed to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and\nwanted to give it to you. Do you remember?\"\n\n\"And do you remember,\" Natasha asked with a pensive smile, \"how\nonce, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us\ninto the study--that was in the old house--and it was dark--we went in\nand suddenly there stood...\"\n\n\"A Negro,\" chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. \"Of course\nI remember. Even now I don\'t know whether there really was a Negro, or\nif we only dreamed it or were told about him.\"\n\n\"He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and\nlooked at us...\"\n\n\"Sonya, do you remember?\" asked Nicholas.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I do remember something too,\" Sonya answered timidly.\n\n\"You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,\" said\nNatasha, \"and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you\nremember!\"\n\n\"Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.\"\n\n\"How strange it is! It\'s as if it were a dream! I like that.\"\n\n\"And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,\nand suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was\nthat real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?\"\n\n\"Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun\nin the porch?\"\n\nSo they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not\nthe sad memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones--those\nimpressions of one\'s most distant past in which dreams and realities\nblend--and they laughed with quiet enjoyment.\n\nSonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they\nshared the same reminiscences.\n\nMuch that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she\nrecalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced.\nShe simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.\n\nShe only really took part when they recalled Sonya\'s first\narrival. She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because\nhe had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too,\nwould be sewn up with cords.\n\n\"And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a\ncabbage,\" said Natasha, \"and I remember that I dared not disbelieve\nit then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.\"\n\nWhile they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other\ndoor of the sitting room.\n\n\"They have brought the cock, Miss,\" she said in a whisper.\n\n\"It isn\'t wanted, Petya. Tell them to take it away,\" replied\nNatasha.\n\nIn the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and\nwent up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its\ncloth covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.\n\n\"Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,\" came the\nold countess\' voice from the drawing room.\n\nDimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natasha, Nicholas, and Sonya,\nremarked: \"How quiet you young people are!\"\n\n\"Yes, we\'re philosophizing,\" said Natasha, glancing round for a\nmoment and then continuing the conversation. They were now\ndiscussing dreams.\n\nDimmler began to play; Natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the\ntable, took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself\nquietly in her former place. It was dark in the room especially\nwhere they were sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the\nsilvery light of the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished\nthe piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings,\nevidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Natasha in a whisper, moving closer to\nNicholas and Sonya, \"that when one goes on and on recalling\nmemories, one at last begins to remember what happened before one\nwas in the world...\"\n\n\"That is metempsychosis,\" said Sonya, who had always learned well,\nand remembered everything. \"The Egyptians believed that our souls have\nlived in animals, and will go back into animals again.\"\n\n\"No, I don\'t believe we ever were in animals,\" said Natasha, still\nin a whisper though the music had ceased. \"But I am certain that we\nwere angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we\nremember....\"\n\n\"May I join you?\" said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat\ndown by them.\n\n\"If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?\" said Nicholas.\n\"No, that can\'t be!\"\n\n\"Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was\nbefore?\" Natasha rejoined with conviction. \"The soul is immortal--well\nthen, if I shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a\nwhole eternity.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,\" remarked\nDimmler, who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending\nsmile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they.\n\n\"Why is it hard to imagine eternity?\" said Natasha. \"It is now\ntoday, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday,\nand the day before...\"\n\n\"Natasha! Now it\'s your turn. Sing me something,\" they heard the\ncountess say. \"Why are you sitting there like conspirators?\"\n\n\"Mamma, I don\'t at all want to,\" replied Natasha, but all the same\nshe rose.\n\nNone of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break\noff their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but\nNatasha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as\nusual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the\nresonance was best, Natasha began to sing her mother\'s favorite song.\n\nShe had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had\nsung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The\ncount, from his study where he was talking to Mitenka, heard her\nand, like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in\nhis talk while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped,\nwhile Mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling.\nNicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in\ntime with her. Sonya, as she listened, thought of the immense\ndifference there was between herself and her friend, and how\nimpossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her\ncousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with\ntears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She thought of\nNatasha and of her own youth, and of how there was something unnatural\nand dreadful in this impending marriage of Natasha and Prince Andrew.\n\nDimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with\nclosed eyes.\n\n\"Ah, Countess,\" he said at last, \"that\'s a European talent, she\nhas nothing to learn--what softness, tenderness, and strength....\"\n\n\"Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!\" said the countess,\nnot realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her\nthat Natasha had too much of something, and that because of this she\nwould not be happy. Before Natasha had finished singing,\nfourteen-year-old Petya rushed in delightedly, to say that some\nmummers had arrived.\n\nNatasha stopped abruptly.\n\n\"Idiot!\" she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair,\nthrew herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop\nfor a long time.\n\n\"It\'s nothing, Mamma, really it\'s nothing; only Petya startled\nme,\" she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs\nstill choked her.\n\nThe mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,\ninnkeepers, and ladies--frightening and funny--bringing in with them\nthe cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first\ntimidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed\ninto the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily\nand heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas\ngames. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their\ncostumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,\nsmiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had\ndisappeared.\n\nHalf an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the\nballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt--this was Nicholas. A Turkish\ngirl was Petya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natasha, and a\nCircassian was Sonya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.\n\nAfter the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from\nthose who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided\nthat their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown\nelsewhere.\n\nNicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to\ntake them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them\nabout a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to \"Uncle\'s.\"\n\n\"No, why disturb the old fellow?\" said the countess. \"Besides, you\nwouldn\'t have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the\nMelyukovs\'.\"\n\nMelyukova was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and\ngovernesses, lived three miles from the Rostovs.\n\n\"That\'s right, my dear,\" chimed in the old count, thoroughly\naroused. \"I\'ll dress up at once and go with them. I\'ll make Pashette\nopen her eyes.\"\n\nBut the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad\nleg all these last days. It was decided that the count must not go,\nbut that if Louisa Ivanovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the\nyoung ladies might go to the Melyukovs\', Sonya, generally so timid and\nshy, more urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivanovna not to refuse.\n\nSonya\'s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows\nwere extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very\nhandsome, and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with\nher. Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be\ndecided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person.\nLouisa Ivanovna consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka\nsleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking and\nwhistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch.\n\nNatasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing\nfrom one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax\nwhen they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs,\ntalking, calling to one another, laughing, and shouting.\n\nTwo of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was\nthe old count\'s with a trotter from the Orlov stud as shaft horse, the\nfourth was Nicholas\' own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.\nNicholas, in his old lady\'s dress over which he had belted his\nhussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.\n\nIt was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the\nmetal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked\nround in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.\n\nNatasha, Sonya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas\'\nsleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Petya, into the old count\'s, and the\nrest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.\n\n\"You go ahead, Zakhar!\" shouted Nicholas to his father\'s coachman,\nwishing for a chance to race past him.\n\nThe old count\'s troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,\nsqueaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its\ndeep-toned bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts\nof the middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered\nlike sugar, and threw it up.\n\nNicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the\nothers moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove\nat a steady trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the\ngarden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and\nhid the brilliant moonlight, but as soon as they were past the\nfence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out\nbefore them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish\nshadows. Bang, bang! went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the\nsnow of the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same\nway, and rudely breaking the frost-bound stillness, the troykas\nbegan to speed along the road, one after the other.\n\n\"A hare\'s track, a lot of tracks!\" rang out Natasha\'s voice\nthrough the frost-bound air.\n\n\"How light it is, Nicholas!\" came Sonya\'s voice.\n\nNicholas glanced round at Sonya, and bent down to see her face closer.\nQuite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at\nhim from her sable furs--so close and yet so distant--in the\nmoonlight.\n\n\"That used to be Sonya,\" thought he, and looked at her closer and\nsmiled.\n\n\"What is it, Nicholas?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said he and turned again to the horses.\n\nWhen they came out onto the beaten highroad--polished by sleigh\nrunners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were\nvisible in the moonlight--the horses began to tug at the reins of\ntheir own accord and increased their pace. The near side horse,\narching his head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his\ntraces. The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears as\nif asking: \"Isn\'t it time to begin now?\" In front, already far ahead\nthe deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off, the black\nhorses driven by Zakhar could be clearly seen against the white\nsnow. From that sleigh one could hear the shouts, laughter, and voices\nof the mummers.\n\n\"Gee up, my darlings!\" shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one\nside and flourishing the whip.\n\nIt was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by\nthe side horses who pulled harder--ever increasing their gallop--that\none noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With\nscreams squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses\nto gallop--the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily\nbeneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and\nready to put on speed when required.\n\nNicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and\ncoming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.\n\n\"Where are we?\" thought he. \"It\'s the Kosoy meadow, I suppose. But\nno--this is something new I\'ve never seen before. This isn\'t the Kosoy\nmeadow nor the Demkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is! It is\nsomething new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...\" And shouting\nto his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.\n\nZakhar held back his horses and turned his face, which was already\ncovered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.\n\nNicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhar, stretching out his\narms, clucked his tongue and let his horses go.\n\n\"Now, look out, master!\" he cried.\n\nFaster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved the\nfeet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.\nZakhar, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with\nthe reins.\n\n\"No you won\'t, master!\" he shouted.\n\nNicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar. The horses\nshowered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh--beside\nthem sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of\nswiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.\nThe whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls\nshrieking were heard from different sides.\n\nAgain checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were\nstill surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled\nwith stars.\n\n\"Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the\nleft?\" thought Nicholas. \"Are we getting to the Melyukovs\'? Is this\nMelyukovka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows\nwhat is happening to us--but it is very strange and pleasant\nwhatever it is.\" And he looked round in the sleigh.\n\n\"Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!\" said one of the\nstrange, pretty, unfamiliar people--the one with fine eyebrows and\nmustache.\n\n\"I think this used to be Natasha,\" thought Nicholas, \"and that was\nMadame Schoss, but perhaps it\'s not, and this Circassian with the\nmustache I don\'t know, but I love her.\"\n\n\"Aren\'t you cold?\" he asked.\n\nThey did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh\nbehind shouted something--probably something funny--but they could not\nmake out what he said.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" some voices answered, laughing.\n\n\"But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a\nglitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver\nroofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And\nif this is really Melyukovka, it is still stranger that we drove\nheaven knows where and have come to Melyukovka,\" thought Nicholas.\n\nIt really was Melyukovka, and maids and footmen with merry faces\ncame running, out to the porch carrying candles.\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked someone in the porch.\n\n\"The mummers from the count\'s. I know by the horses,\" replied some\nvoices.');

Ten minutes later, all the young\nMelyukovs joined the mummers.\n\nPelageya Danilovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the\nvisitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,\nwent about among the mummers without removing her spectacles,\npeering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to\nrecognize any of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostovs she\nfailed to recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters,\nor her late husband\'s, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put\non.\n\n\"And who is this?\" she asked her governess, peering into the face\nof her own daughter dressed up as a Kazan-Tartar. \"I suppose it is one\nof the Rostovs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve\nin?\" she asked Natasha. \"Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!\" she\nordered the butler who was handing things round. \"That\'s not forbidden\nby his law.\"\n\nSometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by\nthe dancers, who--having decided once for all that being disguised, no\none would recognize them--were not at all shy, Pelageya Danilovna\nhid her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook\nwith irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.\n\n\"My little Sasha! Look at Sasha!\" she said.\n\nAfter Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelageya Danilovna\nmade the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a\nstring, and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games\ntogether.\n\nIn an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The\ncorked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring,\nflushed, and merry faces. Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the\nmummers, admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly\nhow they suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for\nhaving entertained her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in\nthe drawing room, and the serfs had something served to them in the\nballroom.\n\n\"Now to tell one\'s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!\"\nsaid an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs, during supper.\n\n\"Why?\" said the eldest Melyukov girl.\n\n\"You wouldn\'t go, it takes courage...\"\n\n\"I\'ll go,\" said Sonya.\n\n\"Tell what happened to the young lady!\" said the second Melyukov\ngirl.\n\n\"Well,\" began the old maid, \"a young lady once went out, took a\ncock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After\nsitting a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh\ndrives up with harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in,\njust in the shape of a man, like an officer--comes in and sits down to\ntable with her.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\" screamed Natasha, rolling her eyes with horror.\n\n\"Yes? And how... did he speak?\"\n\n\"Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began\npersuading her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow,\nbut she got frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her\nhands. Then he caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just\nthen...\"\n\n\"Now, why frighten them?\" said Pelageya Danilovna.\n\n\"Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...\" said her daughter.\n\n\"And how does one do it in a barn?\" inquired Sonya.\n\n\"Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on\nwhat you hear; hammering and knocking--that\'s bad; but a sound of\nshifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.\"\n\n\"Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.\"\n\nPelageya Danilovna smiled.\n\n\"Oh, I\'ve forgotten...\" she replied. \"But none of you would go?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will; Pelageya Danilovna, let me! I\'ll go,\" said Sonya.\n\n\"Well, why not, if you\'re not afraid?\"\n\n\"Louisa Ivanovna, may I?\" asked Sonya.\n\nWhether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game\nor talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sonya\'s side, and gazed at\nher with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today,\nthanks to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to\nknow her. And really, that evening, Sonya was brighter, more animated,\nand prettier than Nicholas had ever seen her before.\n\n\"So that\'s what she is like; what a fool I have been!\" he thought\ngazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous\nsmile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.\n\n\"I\'m not afraid of anything,\" said Sonya. \"May I go at once?\" She\ngot up.\n\nThey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and\nlisten, and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her\nhead and shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.\n\n\"What a darling that girl is!\" thought he. \"And what have I been\nthinking of till now?\"\n\nSonya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went\nhastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of\npeople really had made the house stuffy.\n\nOutside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but\neven brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow\nsparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the\nsky and the real stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary,\nwhile the earth was gay.\n\n\"I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?\" thought\nNicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of\nthe house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sonya\nwould pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood\nand across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old\nlime trees fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the\nbarn. The log walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked\nas if hewn out of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A\ntree in the garden snapped with the frost, and then all was again\nperfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the\nstrength of eternal youth and gladness.\n\nFrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the\nbottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he\nheard the voice of an old maidservant saying, \"Straight, straight,\nalong the path, Miss. Only, don\'t look back.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" answered Sonya\'s voice, and along the path toward\nNicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sonya\'s feet in her\nthin shoes.\n\nSonya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of\npaces away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas\nshe had known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman\'s dress,\nwith tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sonya. She ran rapidly\ntoward him.\n\n\"Quite different and yet the same,\" thought Nicholas, looking at her\nface all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the\ncloak that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and\nkissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt\ncork. Sonya kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little\nhands pressed them to his cheeks.\n\n\"Sonya!... Nicholas!\"... was all they said. They ran to the barn and\nthen back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back\nporch.');

He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new\nSonya, and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the\nsensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty air with a full breast\nand, looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling\nsky, felt himself again in fairyland.\n\n\"Sonya, is it well with thee?\" he asked from time to time.\n\n\"Yes!\" she replied. \"And with thee?\"\n\nWhen halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and\nran for a moment to Natasha\'s sleigh and stood on its wing.\n\n\"Natasha!\" he whispered in French, \"do you know I have made up my\nmind about Sonya?\"\n\n\"Have you told her?\" asked Natasha, suddenly beaming all over with\njoy.\n\n\"Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...\nNatasha--are you glad?\"\n\n\"I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I\ndid not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart\nshe has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be\nhappy while Sonya was not,\" continued Natasha. \"Now I am so glad!\nWell, run back to her.\"\n\n\"No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!\" cried Nicholas, peering\ninto her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual,\nand bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before.\n\"Natasha, it\'s magical, isn\'t it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"You have done splendidly.\"\n\n\"Had I seen her before as she is now,\" thought Nicholas, \"I should\nlong ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,\nand all would have been well.\"\n\n\"So you are glad and I have done right?\"\n\n\"Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.\nMamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing!\nI nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of\nSonya, for there is nothing but good in her.\"\n\n\"Then it\'s all right?\" said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the\nexpression of his sister\'s face to see if she was in earnest. Then\nhe jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his\nsleigh. The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and\nbeaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting\nthere, and that Circassian was Sonya, and that Sonya was certainly his\nfuture happy and loving wife.\n\nWhen they reached home and had told their mother how they had\nspent the evening at the Melyukovs\', the girls went to their\nbedroom. When they had undressed, but without washing off the cork\nmustaches, they sat a long time talking of their happiness. They\ntalked of how they would live when they were married, how their\nhusbands would be friends, and how happy they would be. On Natasha\'s\ntable stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had prepared\nbeforehand.\n\n\"Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too\ngood!\" said Natasha, rising and going to the looking glasses.\n\n\"Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you\'ll see him,\" said Sonya.\n\nNatasha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking\nglasses, and sat down.\n\n\"I see someone with a mustache,\" said Natasha, seeing her own face.\n\n\"You mustn\'t laugh, Miss,\" said Dunyasha.\n\nWith Sonya\'s help and the maid\'s, Natasha got the glass she held\ninto the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious\nexpression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the\nreceding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting\n(from tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew,\nin that last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was\nto take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin,\nshe saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the\nlooking glasses.\n\n\"Why is it others see things and I don\'t?\" she said. \"You sit down\nnow, Sonya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I\nfeel so frightened!\"\n\nSonya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began\nlooking.\n\n\"Now, Miss Sonya is sure to see something,\" whispered Dunyasha;\n\"while you do nothing but laugh.\"\n\nSonya heard this and Natasha\'s whisper:\n\n\"I know she will. She saw something last year.\"\n\nFor about three minutes all were silent.\n\n\"Of course she will!\" whispered Natasha, but did not finish...\nsuddenly Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her\neyes with her hand.\n\n\"Oh, Natasha!\" she cried.\n\n\"Did you see? Did you? What was it?\" exclaimed Natasha, holding up\nthe looking glass.\n\nSonya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to\nget up when she heard Natasha say, \"Of course she will!\" She did not\nwish to disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha, but it was hard to\nsit still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped\nher when she covered her eyes.\n\n\"You saw him?\" urged Natasha, seizing her hand.\n\n\"Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,\" Sonya could not help saying,\nnot yet knowing whom Natasha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.\n\n\"But why shouldn\'t I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who\ncan tell whether I saw anything or not?\" flashed through Sonya\'s mind.\n\n\"Yes, I saw him,\" she said.\n\n\"How? Standing or lying?\"\n\n\"No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying\ndown.\"\n\n\"Andrew lying? Is he ill?\" asked Natasha, her frightened eyes\nfixed on her friend.\n\n\"No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he\nturned to me.\" And when saying this she herself fancied she had really\nseen what she described.\n\n\"Well, and then, Sonya?...\"\n\n\"After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and\nred...\"\n\n\"Sonya! When will he come back? When shall I see him!

The countess, who\nhad long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this\ndeclaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that\nhe might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father\nwould give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the\nfirst time, felt that his mother was displeased with him and that,\ndespite her love for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without\nlooking at her son, she sent for her husband and, when he came,\ntried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts, in her son\'s\npresence, but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of\nvexation and left the room. The old count began irresolutely to\nadmonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied\nthat he could not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and\nevidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the\ncountess. In all his encounters with his son, the count was always\nconscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family\nfortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry\nan heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya. On this occasion, he\nwas only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had\nnot been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could\nhave been wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and\nhis uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the\nfamily finances.\n\nThe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son\nagain, but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and, with a\ncruelty neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to\ncatch Nicholas and for ingratitude. Sonya listened silently with\ndowncast eyes to the countess\' cruel words, without understanding what\nwas required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her\nbenefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this\ncase she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She\ncould not help loving the countess and the whole Rostov family, but\nneither could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his\nhappiness depended on that love. She was silent and sad and did not\nreply. Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to\nhave an explanation with his mother. He first implored her to\nforgive him and Sonya and consent to their marriage, then he\nthreatened that if she molested Sonya he would at once marry her\nsecretly.\n\nThe countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her\nbefore, replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying\nwithout his father\'s consent, and he could do the same, but that she\nwould never receive that intriguer as her daughter.\n\nExploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told\nhis mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his\nfeelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time....\nBut he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression\nof his face caused his mother to await with terror, and which would\nperhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had\nnot time to say it, for Natasha, with a pale and set face, entered the\nroom from the door at which she had been listening.\n\n\"Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I\ntell you!...\" she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.\n\n\"Mamma darling, it\'s not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,\" she\nsaid to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of a\nrupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and\nexcitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.\n\n\"Nicholas, I\'ll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,\"\nsaid Natasha.\n\nHer words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which\nshe was aiming.\n\nThe countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter\'s\nbreast, while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.\n\nNatasha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded\nthat Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sonya should not\nbe troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything\nwithout his parents\' knowledge.\n\nFirmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,\nto retire from the army and return and marry Sonya, Nicholas, serious,\nsorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,\npassionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his\nregiment.\n\nAfter Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were more\ndepressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.\n\nSonya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more\nso on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting\ntoward her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of\nhis affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house\nand estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they\nhad to go to Moscow. But the countess\' health obliged them to delay\ntheir departure from day to day.\n\nNatasha, who had borne the first period of separation from her\nbetrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and\nimpatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would\nhave employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no\nadvantage to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the\nmost part irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived\nonly in the thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new\nplaces and new people that interested him. The more interesting his\nletters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from\ngiving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial\nobligation. She could not write, because she could not conceive the\npossibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part\nof what she expressed by voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him\nformal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which she attached no\nimportance herself, and in the rough copies of which the countess\ncorrected her mistakes in spelling.\n\nThere was still no improvement in the countess\' health, but it was\nimpossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natasha\'s\ntrousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince\nAndrew was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkonski was spending\nthe winter, and Natasha felt sure he had already arrived.\n\nSo the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sonya\nand Natasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.');

Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife\nwho now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance\nwith all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.\nAnd this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He\nceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began\ngoing to the Club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in\ntouch with the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess\nHelene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre\nfelt that she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to\nMoscow.\n\nIn Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded\nand fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as\nsoon as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with\ninnumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons,\nthe Kremlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh\ndrivers and hovels of the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old Moscovites who\ndesired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days\nleisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls,\nand the English Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In\nMoscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing\ngown.\n\nMoscow society, from the old women down to the children, received\nPierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready\nawaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest,\nmost intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a\nheedless, genial nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was\nalways empty because it was open to everyone.\n\nBenefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent\nsocieties, gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees,\nFreemasons, churches, and books--no one and nothing met with a refusal\nfrom him, and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large\nsums from him and taken him under their protection, he would have\ngiven everything away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the\nClub without him. As soon as he sank into his place on the sofa\nafter two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded, and talking,\ndisputing, and joking began. When there were quarrels, his kindly\nsmile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists. The Masonic\ndinners were dull and dreary when he was not there.\n\nWhen after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly\nsmile, yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive\noff somewhere with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the\nyoung men. At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies,\nmarried and unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of\nthem, he was equally amiable to all, especially after supper. \"Il\nest charmant; il n\'a pas de sexe,\"* they said of him.\n\n\n*\"He is charming; he has no sex.\"\n\n\nPierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there\nwere hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.\n\nHow horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first\narrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him\nto seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally\npredetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in\nhis position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one\ntime longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia; then\nhimself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then a\nstrategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the\npossibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the\nsinful human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of\nperfection? Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated\nhis serfs?\n\nBut instead of all that--here he was, the wealthy husband of an\nunfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and\ndrinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the\ngovernment a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal\nfavorite in Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile\nhimself to the idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow\ngentlemen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years before.\n\nSometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only\nliving this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought\nof how many, like himself, had entered that life and that Club\ntemporarily, with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it\nwhen not a single tooth or hair remained.\n\nIn moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to\nhim that he was quite different and distinct from those other\nretired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were\nempty, stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position,\n\"while I am still discontented and want to do something for mankind.\nBut perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and\nsought something new, a path in life of their own, and like me were\nbrought by force of circumstances, society, and race--by that\nelemental force against which man is powerless--to the condition I\nam in,\" said he to himself in moments of humility; and after living\nsome time in Moscow he no longer despised, but began to grow fond\nof, to respect, and to pity his comrades in destiny, as he pitied\nhimself.\n\nPierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust\nwith life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such\nacute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.\n\"What for? Why? What is going on in the world?\" he would ask himself\nin perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to\nreflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by\nexperience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste\nto turn away from them, and took up a book, or hurried of to the\nClub or to Apollon Nikolaevich\'s, to exchange the gossip of the town.\n\n\"Helene, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one\nof the stupidest women in the world,\" thought Pierre, \"is regarded by\npeople as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage\nto her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was\ngreat, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor\nFrancis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The\nSpaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their\nvictory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,\nalso through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same\nfourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons\nswear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for\ntheir neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections\nfor the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna\nSeekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that\nnobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does\nnot understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of\ninjuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have\nbuilt in Moscow forty times forty churches--but yesterday a deserter\nwas knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and\nforgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his\nexecution.\" So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception\nwhich everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him\neach time as if it were something new. \"I understand the deception and\nconfusion,\" he thought, \"but how am I to tell them all that I see? I\nhave tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their\nsouls understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears\nthat it must be so! But I--what is to become of me?\" thought he. He\nhad the unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of\nseeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of\nseeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a\nserious part in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes,\nwith evil and deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged\nin, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path\nof activity. Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It was too\ndreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems, so he\nabandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them. He\nfrequented every kind of society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged\nin building, and above all--read.\n\nHe read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home,\nwhile his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book\nand began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping\nto gossip in drawing rooms of the Club, from gossip to carousals and\nwomen; from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking\nbecame more and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the\ndoctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for\nhim, he drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having\npoured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he\nfelt a pleasant warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his\nfellows, and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea\nwithout probing it deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did\nhe feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously\nhad terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always\nconscious of some aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his\nhead after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation\nor read. But under the influence of wine he said to himself: \"It\ndoesn\'t matter. I\'ll get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but\nhave no time now--I\'ll think it all out later on!\" But the later on\nnever came.\n\nIn the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions\nappeared as insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily\npicked up a book, and if anyone came to see him he was glad.\n\nSometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when\nentrenched under the enemy\'s fire, if they have nothing to do, try\nhard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To\nPierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:\nsome in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in\nwomen, some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in\nsport, some in wine, and some in governmental affairs. \"Nothing is\ntrivial, and nothing is important, it\'s all the same--only to save\noneself from it as best one can,\" thought Pierre. \"Only not to see it,\nthat dreadful it!\"');

At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor\nAlexander\'s regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French\ntendency prevailed there, and this, together with his past and his\nintellect and his originality, at once made Prince Nicholas\nBolkonski an object of particular respect to the Moscovites and the\ncenter of the Moscow opposition to the government.\n\nThe prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of\nsenility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent\nevents, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which\nhe accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of\nthis the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of\nrespectful veneration--especially of an evening when he came in to tea\nin his old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone,\ntold his abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and\nscathing criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned\nhouse with its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered\nfootmen, and the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past\ncentury) with his gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who\nwere reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable\nspectacle. But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of\nhours during which they saw their host, there were also twenty-two\nhours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the\nhouse continued.\n\nLatterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.\nThere in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures--talks with\nthe pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills--and\nshe had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not\ngo out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her\ngo anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going\nout himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening\nparties. She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She\nsaw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received\nand dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes\nappeared at their house. She had no friends: during this visit to\nMoscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to\nher. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom she had never been able to be\nquite frank, had now become unpleasant to her, and for various reasons\nPrincess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom she had corresponded for\nthe last five years, was in Moscow, but proved to be quite alien to\nher when they met. Just then Julie, who by the death of her brothers\nhad become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow, was in the full\nwhirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young men who, she\nfancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at\nthat stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last\nchance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or\nnever. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile\nthat she now had no one to write to, since Julie--whose presence\ngave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the old\nemigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his\nevenings for years, she regretted Julie\'s presence and having no one\nto write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one\nto whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just\nthen. The time for Prince Andrew\'s return and marriage was\napproaching, but his request to her to prepare his father for it had\nnot been carried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite\nhopeless, for at every mention of the young Countess Rostova the old\nprince (who apart from that was usually in a bad temper) lost\ncontrol of himself. Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons\nshe gave her six year-old nephew. To her consternation she detected in\nherself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father\'s\nirritability. However often she told herself that she must not get\nirritable when teaching her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in\nhand, she sat down to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to\npour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child--who was\nalready afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry--that at\nhis slightest inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated,\nraised her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in\nthe corner. Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to\ncry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following her\nexample, would sob, and without permission would leave his corner,\ncome to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort her. But\nwhat distressed the princess most of all was her father\'s\nirritability, which was always directed against her and had of late\namounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the\nground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,\nit would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but\nthis loving despot--the more cruel because he loved her and for that\nreason tormented himself and her--knew how not merely to hurt and\nhumiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to\nblame for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that\ntormented Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his\never-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at\nthe first moment of receiving the news of his son\'s intentions had\noccurred to him in jest--that if Andrew got married he himself would\nmarry Bourienne--had evidently pleased him, and latterly he had\npersistently, and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend\nher, shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his\ndissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of\nBourienne.\n\nOne day in Moscow in Princess Mary\'s presence (she thought her\nfather did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed\nMademoiselle Bourienne\'s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her\naffectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few\nminutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary\'s room\nsmiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess\nMary hastily wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently unconscious of what she was\ndoing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice\nbreaking: \"It\'s horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the\nweakness...\" She did not finish. \"Leave my room,\" she exclaimed, and\nburst into sobs.\n\nNext day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she\nnoticed that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne\nshould be served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee\nand from habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew\nfurious, threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to\nhave him conscripted for the army.\n\n\"He doesn\'t obey... I said it twice... and he doesn\'t obey! She is\nthe first person in this house; she\'s my best friend,\" cried the\nprince. \"And if you allow yourself,\" he screamed in a fury, addressing\nPrincess Mary for the first time, \"to forget yourself again before her\nas you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master in this\nhouse. Go! Don\'t let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!\"\n\nPrincess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s pardon, and also her\nfather\'s pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged\nfor her intervention.\n\nAt such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in\nher soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look\nfor his spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not\nseeing them, or would forget something that had just occurred, or take\na false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had\nnoticed his feebleness, or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no\nvisitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep, letting his\nnapkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate. \"He is old and\nfeeble, and I dare to condemn him!\" she thought at such moments,\nwith a feeling of revulsion against herself.');

He was enormously tall, handsome,\namiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an\nextraordinarily clever doctor. He was received in the best houses\nnot merely as a doctor, but as an equal.\n\nPrince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on\nMademoiselle Bourienne\'s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him\nand had grown accustomed to him. Metivier came to see the prince about\ntwice a week.\n\nOn December 6--St. Nicholas\' Day and the prince\'s name day--all\nMoscow came to the prince\'s front door but he gave orders to admit\nno one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom\nhe gave to Princess Mary.\n\nMetivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered\nit proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne,* as he\ntold Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on\nthat morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods.\nHe had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with\neveryone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not\nto be understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet\nabsorbed querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage,\nand she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and\nloaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor\'s\narrival the morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor,\nPrincess Mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door\nthrough which she could hear all that passed in the study.\n\n\n*To force the guard.\n\n\nAt first she heard only Metivier\'s voice, then her father\'s, then\nboth voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung\nopen, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the\nterrified Metivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his\ndressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils\nof his eyes rolled downwards.\n\n\"You don\'t understand?\" shouted the prince, \"but I do! French spy,\nslave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you...\"\n\nMetivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne\nwho at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.\n\n\"The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head.\nKeep calm, I will call again tomorrow,\" said Metivier; and putting his\nfingers to his lips he hastened away.\n\nThrough the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:\n\"Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment\'s peace in my\nown house!\"\n\nAfter Metivier\'s departure the old prince called his daughter in,\nand the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a\nspy had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a\nlist, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was\nthat scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he\nsaid, he could not have a moment\'s peace and could not die quietly.\n\n\"No, ma\'am! We must part, we must part! Understand that,\nunderstand it! I cannot endure any more,\" he said, and left the\nroom. Then, as if afraid she might find some means of consolation,\nhe returned and trying to appear calm added: \"And don\'t imagine I have\nsaid this in a moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and\nit will be carried out--we must part; so find some place for\nyourself....\" But he could not restrain himself and with the virulence\nof which only one who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself,\nhe shook his fists at her and screamed:\n\n\"If only some fool would marry her!\" Then he slammed the door,\nsent for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.\n\nAt two o\'clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.\n\nThese guests--the famous Count Rostopchin, Prince Lopukhin with\nhis nephew, General Chatrov an old war comrade of the prince\'s, and of\nthe younger generation Pierre and Boris Drubetskoy--awaited the prince\nin the drawing room.\n\nBoris, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been\nanxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, and had\ncontrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his\ncase made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his\nhouse.\n\nThe prince\'s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable\nsociety, but his little circle--though not much talked about in\ntown--was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.\nBoris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in\nhis presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St. Nicholas\' Day, and\nRostopchin had replied that he could not come:\n\n\"On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince\nNicholas Bolkonski.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" replied the commander in chief. \"How is he?...\"\n\nThe small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty\nold-fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn\ngathering of a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low\ntones. Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary\nseemed even quieter and more diffident than usual. The guests were\nreluctant to address her, feeling that she was in no mood for their\nconversation. Count Rostopchin alone kept the conversation going,\nnow relating the latest town news, and now the latest political\ngossip.\n\nLopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the\nconversation. Prince Bolkonski listened as a presiding judge\nreceives a report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word,\nshowing that he took heed of what was being reported to him. The\ntone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of\nwhat was being done in the political world. Incidents were related\nevidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to\nworse, but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker\nalways stopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond which his\ncriticism might touch the sovereign himself.\n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon\'s\nseizure of the Duke of Oldenburg\'s territory, and the Russian Note,\nhostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.\n\n\"Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,\" said\nCount Rostopchin, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times\nbefore. \"One only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the\ncrowned heads. Now the Pope\'s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn\'t\nscruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church--yet all keep\nsilent! Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the\nDuke of Oldenburg\'s territory, and even...\" Count Rostopchin paused,\nfeeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was\nimpossible.\n\n\"Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of\nOldenburg,\" said Prince Bolkonski. \"He shifts the Dukes about as I\nmight move my serfs from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan\nestates.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength\nof character and resignation,\" remarked Boris, joining in\nrespectfully.\n\nHe said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the\nhonor of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkonski glanced at\nthe young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his\nmind, evidently considering him too young.\n\n\"I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was\nsurprised how badly the Note was worded,\" remarked Count Rostopchin in\nthe casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.\n\nPierre looked at Rostopchin with naive astonishment, not\nunderstanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the\nNote.\n\n\"Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,\" he asked, \"so\nlong as its substance is forcible?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should\nbe easy to have a good style,\" returned Count Rostopchin.\n\nPierre now understood the count\'s dissatisfaction with the wording\nof the Note.\n\n\"One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,\" remarked\nthe old prince. \"There in Petersburg they are always writing--not\nnotes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a whole\nvolume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!\" and he\nlaughed unnaturally.\n\nThere was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general\ncleared his throat to draw attention.\n\n\"Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The\nfigure cut by the new French ambassador.\"\n\n\"Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His\nMajesty\'s presence.\"\n\n\"His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the\nmarch past,\" continued the general, \"and it seems the ambassador\ntook no notice and allowed himself to reply that: \'We in France pay no\nattention to such trifles!\' The Emperor did not condescend to reply.\nAt the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to\naddress him.\"\n\nAll were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it\nwas impossible to pass any judgment.\n\n\"Impudent fellows!\" said the prince. \"You know Metivier? I turned him\nout of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in spite\nof my request that they should let no one in,\" he went on, glancing\nangrily at his daughter.\n\nAnd he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and\nthe reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy. Though these\nreasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.\n\nAfter the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to\ncongratulate the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.\n\nHe gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,\nclean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told\nher that he had not forgotten the morning\'s talk, that his decision\nremained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his\nspeaking of it to her now.\n\nWhen they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the\nold men sat together.\n\nPrince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the\nimpending war.\n\nHe said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long\nas we sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into\nEuropean affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit.\n\"We ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political\ninterests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only\nthing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will\nnever dare to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!\"\n\n\"How can we fight the French, Prince?\" said Count Rostopchin. \"Can\nwe arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our\nyouths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our\nKingdom of Heaven.\"\n\nHe began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.\n\n\"French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you\nturned Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a\nFrenchman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their\nknees. I went to a party last night, and there out of five ladies\nthree were Roman Catholics and had the Pope\'s indulgence for doing\nwoolwork on Sundays. And they themselves sit there nearly naked,\nlike the signboards at our Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when\none looks at our young people, Prince, one would like to take Peter\nthe Great\'s old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the\nRussian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them.\"\n\nAll were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchin with a smile\nand wagged his head approvingly.\n\n\"Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!\" said Rostopchin,\ngetting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to\nthe prince.\n\n\"Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of\nhearing him!\" said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and\noffering his cheek to be kissed.\n\nFollowing Rostopchin\'s example the others also rose.');

There he wavered\nbetween the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though\nPrincess Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than\nJulie, he, without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to\nher. When they had last met on the old prince\'s name day, she had\nanswered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently\nnot listening to what he was saying.\n\nJulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a\nmanner peculiar to herself.\n\nShe was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become\nvery wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself\nnot merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She\nwas confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a\nvery wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew\nthe less dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could\nassociate with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and\nthe animated company that assembled at her house, without incurring\nany obligation. A man who would have been afraid ten years before of\ngoing every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there,\nfor fear of compromising her and committing himself, would now go\nboldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a\nsexless acquaintance.\n\nThat winter the Karagins\' house was the most agreeable and\nhospitable in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner\nparties, a large company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day,\nsupping at midnight and staying till three in the morning. Julie never\nmissed a ball, a promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of\nthe latest fashion. But in spite of that she seemed to be\ndisillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not\nbelieve either in friendship or in love, or any of the joys of life,\nand expected peace only \"yonder.\" She adopted the tone of one who\nhas suffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either lost\nthe man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of\nthe kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light, and had\neven herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life.\nThis melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing herself, did not\nhinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time\npleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to\nthe melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused himself with\nsociety gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts rimes, which\nwere in vogue at the Karagins\'. Only a few of these young men, among\nthem Boris, entered more deeply into Julie\'s melancholy, and with\nthese she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of\nall worldly things, and to them she showed her albums filled with\nmournful sketches, maxims, and verses.\n\nTo Boris, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early\ndisillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of\nfriendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and\nshowed him her album. Boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote:\n\"Rustic trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.\"\n\nOn another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:\n\n    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.\n    Ah! contre les douleurs il n\'y a pas d\'autre asile.*\n\n\n*Death gives relief and death is peaceful.\n\n\nAh! from suffering there is no other refuge.\n\nJulie said this was charming\n\n\"There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,\" she\nsaid to Boris, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a\nbook. \"It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness\nand despair, showing the possibility of consolation.\"\n\nIn reply Boris wrote these lines:\n\n    Aliment de poison d\'une ame trop sensible,\n    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,\n    Tendre melancholie, ah, viens me consoler,\n    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,\n    Et mele une douceur secrete\n    A ces pleurs que je sens couler.*\n\n\n*Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,\n\n Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,\n\n Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,\n\n Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,\n\n And mingle a secret sweetness\n\n With these tears that I feel to be flowing.\n\n\nFor Boris, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Boris\nread Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the\nreading because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large\ngatherings Julie and Boris looked on one another as the only souls who\nunderstood one another in a world of indifferent people.\n\nAnna Mikhaylovna, who often visited the Karagins, while playing\ncards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie\'s dowry\n(she was to have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests).\nAnna Mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to\nthe wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.\n\n\"You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,\" she said to\nthe daughter. \"Boris says his soul finds repose at your house. He\nhas suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,\" said she to\nthe mother. \"Ah, my dear, I can\'t tell you how fond I have grown of\nJulie latterly,\" she said to her son. \"But who could help loving\nher? She is an angelic being! Ah, Boris, Boris!\"--she paused. \"And how\nI pity her mother,\" she went on; \"today she showed me her accounts and\nletters from Penza (they have enormous estates there), and she, poor\nthing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!\"\n\nBoris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother.\nHe laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had\nto say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Penza and\nNizhegorod estates.\n\nJulie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy\nadorer and was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of\nrepulsion for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for her\nartificiality, and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility\nof real love still restrained Boris. His leave was expiring. He\nspent every day and whole days at the Karagins\', and every day on\nthinking the matter over told himself that he would propose\ntomorrow. But in Julie\'s presence, looking at her red face and chin\n(nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of\ncontinual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural\nrapture of married bliss, Boris could not utter the decisive words,\nthough in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of\nthose Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of\nthe income from them. Julie saw Boris\' indecision, and sometimes the\nthought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him, but her\nfeminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation, and\nshe told herself that he was only shy from love. Her melancholy,\nhowever, began to turn to irritability, and not long before Boris\'\ndeparture she formed a definite plan of action. Just as Boris\' leave\nof absence was expiring, Anatole Kuragin made his appearance in\nMoscow, and of course in the Karagins\' drawing room, and Julie,\nsuddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and very attentive\nto Kuragin.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son, \"I know from a reliable\nsource that Prince Vasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him\nmarried to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for\nher. What do you think of it, my dear?\"\n\nThe idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that\nwhole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing\nall the revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally\napportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another,\nand especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Boris.\nHe drove to the Karagins\' with the firm intention of proposing.\nJulie met him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had\nenjoyed yesterday\'s ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though\nBoris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore\nmeant to be tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine\ninconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how\ntheir moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them.\nJulie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs\nvariety, and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone.\n\n\"Then I should advise you...\" Boris began, wishing to sting her; but\nat that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have\nto leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly\nwasted his efforts--which was a thing he never allowed to happen.\n\nHe checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes\nto avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and\nsaid:\n\n\"I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...\"\n\nHe glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability\nhad suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were\nfixed on him with greedy expectation. \"I can always arrange so as\nnot to see her often,\" thought Boris. \"The affair has been begun and\nmust be finished!\" He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and\nsaid:\n\n\"You know my feelings for you!\"\n\nThere was no need to say more: Julie\'s face shone with triumph and\nself-satisfaction; but she forced Boris to say all that is said on\nsuch occasions--that he loved her and had never loved any other\nwoman more than her. She knew that for the Penza estates and\nNizhegorod forests she could demand this, and she received what she\ndemanded.\n\nThe affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom\nand melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house\nin Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant\nwedding.');

The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it\nwas impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in\nMoscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near\nMoscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his\nfuture daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkonski while he was in\nMoscow could not be missed. The Rostovs\' Moscow house had not been\nheated that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the\ncountess was not with them, the count decided to stay with Marya\nDmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had long been pressing her hospitality\non them.\n\nLate one evening the Rostovs\' four sleighs drove into Marya\nDmitrievna\'s courtyard in the old Konyusheny street. Marya\nDmitrievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter,\nand her sons were all in the service.\n\nShe held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,\nloudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach\nto others for any weakness, passion, or temptation--the possibility of\nwhich she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing\njacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:\non holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on\naffairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after\ndressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there\nwere always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing\nmeal at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she\nplayed a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a\nnew book read to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception\nand went out to pay visits, and then only to the most important\npersons in the town.\n\nShe had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the\npulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the\nRostovs and their servants. Marya Dmitrievna, with her spectacles\nhanging down on her nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall\ndoorway looking with a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might\nhave thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately\nturn them out, had she not at the same time been giving careful\ninstructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and\ntheir belongings.\n\n\"The count\'s things? Bring them here,\" she said, pointing to the\nportmanteaus and not greeting anyone. \"The young ladies\'? There to the\nleft. Now what are you dawdling for?\" she cried to the maids. \"Get the\nsamovar ready!... You\'ve grown plumper and prettier,\" she remarked,\ndrawing Natasha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by\nthe hood. \"Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!\" she\nshouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand. \"You\'re half\nfrozen, I\'m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sonya dear!\" she\nadded, turning to Sonya and indicating by this French greeting her\nslightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.\n\nWhen they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things\nand tidied themselves up after their journey, Marya Dmitrievna\nkissed them all in due order.\n\n\"I\'m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was\nhigh time,\" she said, giving Natasha a significant look. \"The old\nman is here and his son\'s expected any day. You\'ll have to make his\nacquaintance. But we\'ll speak of that later on,\" she added, glancing at\nSonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her\npresence. \"Now listen,\" she said to the count. \"What do you want\ntomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshin?\" she crooked one of her\nfingers. \"The sniveling Anna Mikhaylovna? That\'s two. She\'s here\nwith her son. The son is getting married! Then Bezukhov, eh? He is\nhere too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping\nafter him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them\"--and she\npointed to the girls--\"tomorrow I\'ll take them first to the Iberian\nshrine of the Mother of God, and then we\'ll drive to the\nSuper-Rogue\'s. I suppose you\'ll have everything new. Don\'t judge by\nme: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Irina\nVasilevna came to see me; she was an awful sight--looked as if she had\nput two barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without\nsome new fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?\" she asked\nthe count sternly.\n\n\"One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a\npurchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If\nyou will be so kind, I\'ll fix a time and go down to the estate just\nfor a day, and leave my lassies with you.\"\n\n\"All right. All right. They\'ll be safe with me, as safe as in\nChancery! I\'ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet\nthem a bit,\" said Marya Dmitrievna, touching her goddaughter and\nfavorite, Natasha, on the cheek with her large hand.\n\nNext morning Marya Dmitrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian\nshrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so\nafraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at\na loss merely to get rid of her. Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the\nwhole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the\nroom except Natasha, and then called her pet to her armchair.\n\n\"Well, now we\'ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.\nYou\'ve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I\'ve known\nhim since he was so high.\" She held her hand a couple of feet from the\nground. Natasha blushed happily. \"I like him and all his family. Now\nlisten! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son\'s\nmarrying. The old fellow\'s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a\nchild and can shift without him, but it\'s not nice to enter a family\nagainst a father\'s will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.\nYou\'re a clever girl and you\'ll know how to manage. Be kind, and use\nyour wits. Then all will be well.\"\n\nNatasha remained silent, from shyness Marya Dmitrievna supposed, but\nreally because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her\nlove of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human\naffairs that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince\nAndrew, he loved her only, and was to come one of these days and\ntake her. She wanted nothing more.\n\n\"You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your\nfuture sister-in-law. \'Husbands\' sisters bring up blisters,\' but\nthis one wouldn\'t hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two\ntogether. Tomorrow you\'ll go with your father to see her. Be very nice\nand affectionate to her: you\'re younger than she. When he comes, he\'ll\nfind you already know his sister and father and are liked by them.\nAm I right or not? Won\'t that be best?\"\n\n\"Yes, it will,\" Natasha answered reluctantly.');

The count did not set out\ncheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well\nremembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the\ntime of the enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he\nhad had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his\nfull quota of men. Natasha, on the other hand, having put on her\nbest gown, was in the highest spirits. \"They can\'t help liking me,\"\nshe thought. \"Everybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do\nanything they wish, so ready to be fond of him--for being his\nfather--and of her--for being his sister--that there is no reason\nfor them not to like me...\"\n\nThey drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvizhenka and\nentered the vestibule.\n\n\"Well, the Lord have mercy on us!\" said the count, half in jest,\nhalf in earnest; but Natasha noticed that her father was flurried on\nentering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the\nprince and princess were at home.\n\nWhen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the\nservants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by\nanother in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a\nmaidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning\nthe princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced\nto the Rostovs that the prince was not receiving, but that the\nprincess begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the\nvisitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and\ndaughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess\'\nroom. The princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in\npatches, ran in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly\ntrying to appear cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess\nMary did not like Natasha. She thought her too fashionably dressed,\nfrivolously gay and vain. She did not at all realize that before\nhaving seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by\ninvoluntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by\njealousy of her brother\'s love for her. Apart from this insuperable\nantipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated just then because on\nthe Rostovs\' being announced, the old prince had shouted that he did\nnot wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but\nthey were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive\nthem, but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some\nfreak, as he seemed much upset by the Rostovs\' visit.\n\n\"There, my dear princess, I\'ve brought you my songstress,\" said\nthe count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old\nprince might appear. \"I am so glad you should get to know one\nanother... very sorry the prince is still ailing,\" and after a few\nmore commonplace remarks he rose. \"If you\'ll allow me to leave my\nNatasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I\'ll drive\nround to see Anna Semenovna, it\'s quite near in the Dogs\' Square,\nand then I\'ll come back for her.\"\n\nThe count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told\nhis daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk\nto one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of\nencountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention\nthis to his daughter, but Natasha noticed her father\'s nervousness and\nanxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still\nangrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold\nand defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of\nanybody. The princess told the count that she would be delighted,\nand only begged him to stay longer at Anna Semenovna\'s, and he\ndeparted.\n\nDespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary--who\nwished to have a tete-a-tete with Natasha--Mademoiselle Bourienne\nremained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements\nand theaters. Natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had\nnoticed in the anteroom, by her father\'s nervousness, and by the\nunnatural manner of the princess who--she thought--was making a\nfavor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her. She did\nnot like Princess Mary, whom she thought very plain, affected, and\ndry. Natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an\noffhand air which alienated Princess Mary still more. After five\nminutes of irksome, constrained conversation, they heard the sound\nof slippered feet rapidly approaching. Princess Mary looked\nfrightened.\n\nThe door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white\nnightcap, came in.\n\n\"Ah, madam!\" he began. \"Madam, Countess... Countess Rostova, if I am\nnot mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not\nknow, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with\na visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg\nyou to excuse me... God is my witness, I didn\'t know-\" he repeated,\nstressing the word \"God\" so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that\nPrincess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at\nher father or at Natasha.\n\nNor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.\nMademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.\n\n\"I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not\nknow,\" muttered the old man, and after looking Natasha over from\nhead to foot he went out.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this\napparition and began speaking about the prince\'s indisposition.\nNatasha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the\nlonger they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater\ngrew their antipathy to one another.\n\nWhen the count returned, Natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened\nto get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who\ncould place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an\nhour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. \"I couldn\'t begin\ntalking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,\" thought\nNatasha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary.\nShe knew what she ought to have said to Natasha, but she had been\nunable to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and\nbecause, without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of\nthe marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess\nMary went up hurriedly to Natasha, took her by the hand, and said with\na deep sigh:\n\n\"Wait, I must...\"\n\nNatasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.\n\n\"Dear Natalie,\" said Princess Mary, \"I want you to know that I am\nglad my brother has found happiness....\"\n\nShe paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Natasha\nnoticed this and guessed its reason.\n\n\"I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,\"\nshe said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears\nchoking her.\n\n\"What have I said and what have I done?\" thought she, as soon as she\nwas out of the room.\n\nThey waited a long time for Natasha to come to dinner that day.\nShe sat in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing.\nSonya stood beside her, kissing her hair.\n\n\"Natasha, what is it about?\" she asked. \"What do they matter to you?\nIt will all pass, Natasha.\"\n\n\"But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...\"\n\n\"Don\'t talk about it, Natasha. It wasn\'t your fault so why should\nyou mind? Kiss me,\" said Sonya.\n\nNatasha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed\nher wet face against her.\n\n\"I can\'t tell you, I don\'t know. No one\'s to blame,\" said\nNatasha--\"It\'s my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn\'t he\ncome?...\"\n\nShe came in to dinner with red eyes. Marya Dmitrievna, who knew\nhow the prince had received the Rostovs, pretended not to notice how\nupset Natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the\ncount and the other guests.');

When she\ncame ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and\nlooking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty, very\npretty, she felt even more sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.\n\n\"O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but\ndifferently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply\nembrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those\nsearching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me,\nand then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes--how\nI see those eyes!\" thought Natasha. \"And what do his father and sister\nmatter to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those\neyes, with his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not\nthink of him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for\nthe present.

I can\'t!\"\n\nNatasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not\nenough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at\nonce, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words\nof love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside\nher father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps\nflickering on the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in\nlove, and forgot where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into\nthe line of carriages, the Rostovs\' carriage drove up to the\ntheater, its wheels squeaking over the snow. Natasha and Sonya,\nholding up their dresses, jumped out quickly. The count got out helped\nby the footmen, and, passing among men and women who were entering and\nthe program sellers, they all three went along the corridor to the\nfirst row of boxes. Through the closed doors the music was already\naudible.\n\n\"Natasha, your hair!...\" whispered Sonya.\n\nAn attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and\nopened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the\ndoor rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and\nshoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered\nbefore their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of\nfeminine envy at Natasha. The curtain had not yet risen and the\noverture was being played. Natasha, smoothing her gown, went in with\nSonya and sat down, scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite.\nA sensation she had not experienced for a long time--that of\nhundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck--suddenly\naffected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole\ncrowd of memories, desires and emotions associated with that feeling.\n\nThe two remarkably pretty girls, Natasha and Sonya, with Count\nRostov who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted\ngeneral attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natasha\'s\nengagement to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostovs had lived in\nthe country ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who\nwas making one of the best matches in Russia.\n\nNatasha\'s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the\ncountry, and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly\npretty. She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and\nbeauty, combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her\nblack eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her\ndelicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the\nbox, while, evidently unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in\ntime to the music, crumpling her program. \"Look, there\'s Alenina,\"\nsaid Sonya, \"with her mother, isn\'t it?\"\n\n\"Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!\" remarked\nthe count.\n\n\"Look at our Anna Mikhaylovna--what a headdress she has on!\"\n\n\"The Karagins, Julie--and Boris with them. One can see at once\nthat they\'re engaged....\"\n\n\"Drubetskoy has proposed?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I heard it today,\" said Shinshin, coming into the\nRostovs\' box.\n\nNatasha looked in the direction in which her father\'s eyes were\nturned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on\nher face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck--which\nNatasha knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and\nleaning over with an ear to Julie\'s mouth, was Boris\' handsome\nsmoothly brushed head. He looked at the Rostovs from under his brows\nand said something, smiling, to his betrothed.\n\n\"They are talking about us, about me and him!\" thought Natasha. \"And\nhe no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn\'t trouble\nthemselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of\nthem.\"\n\nBehind them sat Anna Mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and\nwith a happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their\nbox was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which\nNatasha knew so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly\nremembered all that had been so humiliating in her morning\'s visit.\n\n\"What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,\nbetter not think of it--not till he comes back!\" she told herself, and\nbegan looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the\nstalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against the\norchestra rail, stood Dolokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair\nbrushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,\nwell aware that he was attracting everyone\'s attention, yet as much at\nease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow\'s\nmost brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.\n\nThe count, laughing, nudged the blushing Sonya and pointed to her\nformer adorer.\n\n\"Do you recognize him?\" said he. \"And where has he sprung from?\"\nhe asked, turning to Shinshin. \"Didn\'t he vanish somewhere?\"\n\n\"He did,\" replied Shinshin. \"He was in the Caucasus and ran away\nfrom there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling\nprince in Persia, where he killed the Shah\'s brother. Now all the\nMoscow ladies are mad about him! It\'s \'Dolokhov the Persian\' that does\nit! We never hear a word but Dolokhov is mentioned. They swear by him,\nthey offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet. Dolokhov\nand Anatole Kuragin have turned all our ladies\' heads.\"\n\nA tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed\nplump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string\nof large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk\ndress and took a long time settling into her place.\n\nNatasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and\npearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the\npearls. While Natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time\nthe lady looked round and, meeting the count\'s eyes, nodded to him and\nsmiled. She was the Countess Bezukhova, Pierre\'s wife, and the\ncount, who knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.\n\n\"Have you been here long, Countess?\" he inquired. \"I\'ll call, I\'ll\ncall to kiss your hand. I\'m here on business and have brought my girls\nwith me. They say Semenova acts marvelously. Count Pierre never used\nto forget us. Is he here?\"\n\n\"Yes, he meant to look in,\" answered Helene, and glanced attentively\nat Natasha.\n\nCount Rostov resumed his seat.\n\n\"Handsome, isn\'t she?\" he whispered to Natasha.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" answered Natasha. \"She\'s a woman one could easily\nfall in love with.\"\n\nJust then the last chords of the overture were heard and the\nconductor tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in\nthe stalls, and the curtain rose.\n\nAs soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent,\nand all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and\nall the women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole\nattention with eager curiosity to the stage. Natasha too began to look\nat it.');

In the center of the stage sat some girls\nin red bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk\ndress sat apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of\ngreen cardboard was glued. They all sang something. When they had\nfinished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter\'s box\nand a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding\na plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing, waving his\narms about.\n\nFirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang,\nthen they both paused while the orchestra played and the man\nfingered the hand of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to\nstart singing with her. They sang together and everyone in the theater\nbegan clapping and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage--who\nrepresented lovers--began smiling, spreading out their arms, and\nbowing.\n\nAfter her life in the country, and in her present serious mood,\nall this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha. She could not follow\nthe opera nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted\ncardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke,\nand sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it was\nall meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously false and\nunnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused\nat them. She looked at the faces of the audience, seeking in them\nthe same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced, but\nthey all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage, and\nexpressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned. \"I suppose it has\nto be like this!\" she thought. She kept looking round in turn at the\nrows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women\nin the boxes, especially at Helene in the next box, who--apparently\nquite unclothed--sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her\neyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded the\nwhole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little by\nlittle began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not\nexperienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she\nwas, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought,\nthe strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through\nher mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box\nand singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to\ntouch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then\nto lean over to Helene and tickle her.\n\nAt a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song,\na door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostovs\' box\ncreaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. \"There\'s\nKuragin!\" whispered Shinshin. Countess Bezukhova turned smiling to the\nnewcomer, and Natasha, following the direction of that look, saw an\nexceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a\nself-assured yet courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kuragin whom\nshe had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was\nnow in an adjutant\'s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot.\nHe moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous\nhad he not been so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn\nsuch an expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though\nthe performance was proceeding, he walked deliberately down the\ncarpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his\nhandsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at Natasha he\napproached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her\nbox, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a\nmotion toward Natasha.\n\n\"Mais charmante!\" said he, evidently referring to Natasha, who did\nnot exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of\nhis lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and\nsat down beside Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and\noffhand way that Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He\nwinked at him gaily, smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra\nscreen.\n\n\"How like the brother is to the sister,\" remarked the count. \"And\nhow handsome they both are!\"\n\nShinshin, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some\nintrigue of Kuragin\'s in Moscow, and Natasha tried to overhear it just\nbecause he had said she was \"charmante.\"\n\nThe first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about,\ngoing out and coming in.\n\nBoris came to the Rostovs\' box, received their congratulations\nvery simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile\nconveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fiancee\'s invitation to her wedding,\nand went away. Natasha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and\ncongratulated on his approaching wedding that same Boris with whom she\nhad formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,\neverything seemed simple and natural.\n\nThe scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way, and\nNatasha gave Boris a similar smile.\n\nHelene\'s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most\ndistinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another\nin their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.\n\nDuring the whole of that entr\'acte Kuragin stood with Dolokhov in\nfront of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostovs\' box. Natasha\nknew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even\nturned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its\nmost becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act Pierre\nappeared in the stalls. The Rostovs had not seen him since their\narrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since\nNatasha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing\nanyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at\nand indicating the Rostovs\' box. On seeing Natasha Pierre grew\nanimated and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box.\nWhen he got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to\nher for a long time. While conversing with Pierre, Natasha heard a\nman\'s voice in Countess Bezukhova\'s box and something told her it\nwas Kuragin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed\nstraight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that\nit seemed strange to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be\nso sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.\n\nIn the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there\nwas a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were\nraised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep\nnotes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black\ncloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands. They began\nwaving their arms. Then some other people ran in and began dragging\naway the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue.\nThey did not drag her away at once, but sang with her for a long\ntime and then at last dragged her off, and behind the scenes something\nmetallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a\nprayer. All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the\nenthusiastic shouts of the audience.\n\nDuring this act every time Natasha looked toward the stalls she\nsaw Anatole Kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,\nstaring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her\nand it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.\n\nWhen the second act was over Countess Bezukhova rose, turned to\nthe Rostovs\' box--her whole bosom completely exposed--beckoned the old\ncount with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had\nentered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.\n\n\"Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters,\" said she. \"The\nwhole town is singing their praises and I don\'t even know then!\"\n\nNatasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so\npleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with\npleasure.\n\n\"I want to become a Moscovite too, now,\" said Helene. \"How is it\nyou\'re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?\"\n\nCountess Bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a\nfascinating woman. She could say what she did not think--especially\nwhat was flattering--quite simply and naturally.\n\n\"Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I\nam not staying here long this time--nor are you--I will try to amuse\nthem. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get\nto know you,\" said she to Natasha with her stereotyped and lovely\nsmile. \"I had heard about you from my page, Drubetskoy. Have you heard\nhe is getting married? And also from my husband\'s friend Bolkonski,\nPrince Andrew Bolkonski,\" she went on with special emphasis,\nimplying that she knew of his relation to Natasha. To get better\nacquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her\nbox for the rest of the performance, and Natasha moved over to it.\n\nThe scene of the third act represented a palace in which many\ncandles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on\nthe walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a\nqueen. The king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang\nsomething badly and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had\nbeen first in white and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and\nstood beside the throne with her hair down. She sang something\nmournfully, addressing the queen, but the king waved his arm severely,\nand men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began\ndancing all together. Then the violins played very shrilly and merrily\nand one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms, separating\nfrom the others, went behind the wings, adjusted her bodice,\nreturned to the middle of the stage, and began jumping and striking\none foot rapidly against the other. In the stalls everyone clapped and\nshouted \"bravo!\" Then one of the men went into a corner of the\nstage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly,\nand this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet\nabout very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty thousand rubles\na year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes, and galleries\nbegan clapping and shouting with all their might, and the man\nstopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men\nand women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the\nsound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm\ncame on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the\norchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number\naway, and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise\nand clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone\nbegan shouting: \"Duport! Duport! Duport!\" Natasha no longer thought\nthis strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.\n\n\"Isn\'t Duport delightful?\" Helene asked her.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Natasha.');

Anatole, who was\nas handsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her\nand told her he had long wished to have this happiness--ever since the\nNaryshkins\' ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered\npleasure of seeing her. Kuragin was much more sensible and simple with\nwomen than among men. He talked boldly and naturally, and Natasha\nwas strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was\nnothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk,\nbut that on the contrary his smile was most naive, cheerful, and\ngood-natured.\n\nKuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a\nprevious performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage.\n\n\"And do you know, Countess,\" he said, suddenly addressing her as\nan old, familiar acquaintance, \"we are getting up a costume\ntournament; you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We\nshall all meet at the Karagins\'! Please come! No! Really, eh?\" said\nhe.\n\nWhile saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,\nher neck, and her bare arms. Natasha knew for certain that he was\nenraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel\nconstrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt\nthat he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his\neye so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking\ninto his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that\nbarrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other\nmen. She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come\nto feel herself terribly near to this man. When she turned away she\nfeared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her\non the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that\nthey were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man.\nNatasha kept turning to Helene and to her father, as if asking what it\nall meant, but Helene was engaged in conversation with a general and\ndid not answer her look, and her father\'s eyes said nothing but what\nthey always said: \"Having a good time? Well, I\'m glad of it!\"\n\nDuring one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole\'s\nprominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natasha, to\nbreak the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the\nquestion and blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she\nwas doing something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage\nher.\n\n\"At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant\nce sont les jolies femmes,* isn\'t that so? But now I like it very much\nindeed,\" he said, looking at her significantly. \"You\'ll come to the\ncostume tournament, Countess? Do come!\" and putting out his hand to\nher bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, \"You will be the\nprettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as\na pledge!\"\n\n\n*Are the pretty women.\n\n\nNatasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did\nhimself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an\nimproper intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if\nshe had not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she\nfelt that he was there, behind, so close behind her.\n\n\"How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?\" she asked\nherself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked\nstraight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the\ngood-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just\nas he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt\nwith horror that no barrier lay between him and her.\n\nThe curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay.\nNatasha went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive\nto the world she found herself in. All that was going on before her\nnow seemed quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous\nthoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country\ndid not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote\npast.\n\nIn the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his\narm about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he\ndisappeared down below. That was the only part of the fourth act\nthat Natasha saw. She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of\nthis was Kuragin whom she could not help watching. As they were\nleaving the theater Anatole came up to them, called their carriage,\nand helped them in. As he was putting Natasha in he pressed her arm\nabove the elbow. Agitated and flushed she turned round. He was looking\nat her with glittering eyes, smiling tenderly.\n\n\nOnly after she had reached home was Natasha able clearly to think\nover what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince\nAndrew she was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after\nthe opera, she gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the\nroom.\n\n\"O God! I am lost!\" she said to herself. \"How could I let him?\"\nShe sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to\nrealize what had happened to her, but was unable either to\nunderstand what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark,\nobscure, and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater\nwhere the bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped\nabout to the music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the\nnearly naked Helene with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried\n\"bravo!\"--there in the presence of that Helene it had all seemed clear\nand simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.\n\"What is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this\ngnawing of conscience I am feeling now?\" she thought.\n\nOnly to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have told all\nshe was feeling. She knew that Sonya with her severe and simple\nviews would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at\nsuch a confession. So Natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by\nherself.\n\n\"Am I spoiled for Andrew\'s love or not?\" she asked herself, and with\nsoothing irony replied: \"What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen\nto me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn\'t lead him on at all.\nNobody will know and I shall never see him again,\" she told herself.\n\"So it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to\nrepent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why \'still?\' O God, why\nisn\'t he here?\" Natasha quieted herself for a moment, but again some\ninstinct told her that though all this was true, and though nothing\nhad happened, yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew\nhad perished. And again in imagination she went over her whole\nconversation with Kuragin, and again saw the face, gestures, and\ntender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.');

He indicated to\nhim Princess Mary and Julie Karagina.\n\nAnatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre\'s\nhouse. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him\nafter a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and\ngave him money under the guise of loans.\n\nAs Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had\nturned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that\nhe slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French\nactresses--with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to\nbe on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at\nDanilov\'s or other Moscow revelers\', drank whole nights through,\noutvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the\nbest society. There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies,\nand he flirted with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run\nafter the unmarried girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most\nof them plain. There was a special reason for this, as he had got\nmarried two years before--a fact known only to his most intimate\nfriends. At that time while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish\nlandowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole\nhad very soon abandoned his wife and, for a payment which he agreed to\nsend to his father-in-law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off\nas a bachelor.\n\nAnatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with\nothers. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was\nimpossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had\nnever in his life done anything base. He was incapable of\nconsidering how his actions might affect others or what the\nconsequences of this or that action of his might be. He was\nconvinced that, as a duck is so made that it must live in water, so\nGod had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year\nand always occupy a prominent position in society. He believed this so\nfirmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of it too and did\nnot refuse him either a leading place in society or money, which he\nborrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay.\n\nHe was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning.\nHe was not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still\nless could he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed\nhis father by spoiling his own career, and he laughed at\ndistinctions of all kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse\nanyone who asked of him. All he cared about was gaiety and women,\nand as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in\nthese tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the\ngratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly\nconsidered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad\npeople, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.\n\nRakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence\nsimilar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope\nof forgiveness. \"All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all\nwill be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.\"\n\nDolokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and\nhis Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling,\nand dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kuragin\nand made use of him for his own ends.\n\nAnatole was sincerely fond of Dolokhov for his cleverness and\naudacity. Dolokhov, who needed Anatole Kuragin\'s name, position, and\nconnections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set,\nmade use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting\nthe other feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole,\nthe very process of dominating another\'s will was in itself a\npleasure, a habit, and a necessity to Dolokhov.\n\nNatasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin. At supper after the\nopera he described to Dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the\nattractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his\nintention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was\nincapable of considering what might come of such love-making, as he\nnever had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions.\n\n\"She\'s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,\" replied\nDolokhov.\n\n\"I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,\" said Anatole. \"Eh?\"\n\n\"You\'d better wait till she\'s married....\"\n\n\"You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,\"\npursued Anatole.\n\n\"You have been caught once already by a \'little girl,\'\" said\nDolokhov who knew of Kuragin\'s marriage. \"Take care!\"\n\n\"Well, that can\'t happen twice!

Marya Dmitrievna talked to the count about something\nwhich they concealed from Natasha. Natasha guessed they were talking\nabout the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and\noffended her. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice\nthat day sent a manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he\nhad come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now than during her\nfirst days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining for him were now\nadded the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess\nMary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety of which she did not\nunderstand the cause. She continually fancied that either he would\nnever come or that something would happen to her before he came. She\ncould no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she\nhad done before. As soon as she began to think of him, the\nrecollection of the old prince, of Princess Mary, of the theater,\nand of Kuragin mingled with her thoughts. The question again presented\nitself whether she was not guilty, whether she had not already\nbroken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found herself recalling\nto the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and every shade in\nthe play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to\narouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To\nthe family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less\ntranquil and happy than before.\n\nOn Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to Mass at\nher parish church--the Church of the Assumption built over the\ngraves of victims of the plague.\n\n\"I don\'t like those fashionable churches,\" she said, evidently\npriding herself on her independence of thought. \"God is the same every\nwhere. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently\nand with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is there\nin giving concerts in the choir? I don\'t like it, it\'s just\nself-indulgence!\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her\nwhole house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the\nservants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church.\nAt her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had\nvodka and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was\nthe holiday so noticeable as in Marya Dmitrievna\'s broad, stern\nface, which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.\n\nAfter Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room\nwhere the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a\nservant announced that the carriage was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna\nrose with a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid\ncalls, and announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas\nBolkonski to have an explanation with him about Natasha.\n\nAfter she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on\nthe Rostovs, and Natasha, very glad of this diversion, having shut\nherself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself\ntrying on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without\nsleeves and only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in\nthe glass how the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the\nanimated sounds of her father\'s voice and another\'s--a woman\'s--that\nmade her flush. It was Helene. Natasha had not time to take off the\nbodice before the door opened and Countess Bezukhova, dressed in a\npurple velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with\ngood-humored amiable smiles.\n\n\"Oh, my enchantress!\" she cried to the blushing Natasha.\n\"Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,\" said\nshe to Count Rostov who had followed her in. \"How can you live in\nMoscow and go nowhere? No, I won\'t let you off! Mademoiselle George\nwill recite at my house tonight and there\'ll be some people, and if\nyou don\'t bring your lovely girls--who are prettier than\nMademoiselle George--I won\'t know you! My husband is away in Tver or I\nwould send him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must!\nBetween eight and nine.\"\n\nShe nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied\nrespectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the\nlooking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely.\nShe did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually\npraising Natasha\'s beauty. She looked at Natasha\'s dresses and praised\nthem, as well as a new dress of her own made of \"metallic gauze,\"\nwhich she had received from Paris, and advised Natasha to have one\nlike it.\n\n\"But anything suits you, my charmer!\" she remarked.\n\nA smile of pleasure never left Natasha\'s face. She felt happy and as\nif she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess\nBezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and\nimportant and was now so kind to her. Natasha brightened up and felt\nalmost in love with this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind.\nHelene for her part was sincerely delighted with Natasha and wished to\ngive her a good time. Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natasha\ntogether, and she was calling on the Rostovs for that purpose. The\nidea of throwing her brother and Natasha together amused her.\n\nThough at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natasha\nfor drawing Boris away, she did not think of that now, and in her\nown way heartily wished Natasha well. As she was leaving the Rostovs\nshe called her protegee aside.\n\n\"My brother dined with me yesterday--we nearly died of laughter--he\nate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite\nmadly, in love with you, my dear.\"\n\nNatasha blushed scarlet when she heard this.\n\n\"How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!\" said Helene. \"You\nmust certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a\nreason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your\nfiance would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to\ndeath.\"\n\n\"So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre--that\ngood Pierre--have talked and laughed about this. So it\'s all right.\"\nAnd again, under Helene\'s influence, what had seemed terrible now\nseemed simple and natural. \"And she is such a grande dame, so kind,\nand evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?\" thought\nNatasha, gazing at Helene with wide-open, wondering eyes.\n\nMarya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having\nevidently suffered a defeat at the old prince\'s. She was still too\nagitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly.\nIn answer to the count\'s inquiries she replied that things were all\nright and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of\nCountess Bezukhova\'s visit and the invitation for that evening,\nMarya Dmitrievna remarked:\n\n\"I don\'t care to have anything to do with Bezukhova and don\'t advise\nyou to; however, if you\'ve promised--go. It will divert your\nthoughts,\" she added, addressing Natasha.');

There were a\ngood many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natasha. Count\nRostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost\nentirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct.\nMademoiselle George was standing in a corner of the drawing room\nsurrounded by young men. There were several Frenchmen present, among\nthem Metivier who from the time Helene reached Moscow had been an\nintimate in her house. The count decided not to sit down to cards or\nlet his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle\nGeorge\'s performance was over.\n\nAnatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rostovs.\nImmediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha and\nfollowed her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same\nfeeling she had had at the opera--gratified vanity at his admiration\nof her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them.\n\nHelene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of\nher beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George\nwent out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people\nbegan arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a\nchair for Natasha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count,\nwho never lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down\nbehind her.\n\nMademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red\nshawl draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for\nher, and assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was\naudible.\n\nMademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience\nand began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for\nher son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,\nlifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse\nsounds, rolling her eyes.\n\n\"Adorable! divine! delicious!\" was heard from every side.\n\nNatasha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor\nunderstood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself\nagain completely borne away into this strange senseless world--so\nremote from her old world--a world in which it was impossible to know\nwhat was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,\nand conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of\nexpectancy.\n\nAfter the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded\nMademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.\n\n\"How beautiful she is!\" Natasha remarked to her father who had\nalso risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.\n\n\"I don\'t think so when I look at you!\" said Anatole, following\nNatasha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him.\n\"You are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never\nceased...\"\n\n\"Come, come, Natasha!\" said the count, as he turned back for his\ndaughter. \"How beautiful she is!\" Natasha without saying anything\nstepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring\neyes.\n\nAfter giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and\nCountess Bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.\n\nThe count wished to go home, but Helene entreated him not to spoil\nher improvised ball, and the Rostovs stayed on. Anatole asked\nNatasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand\nand told her she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the\necossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when\nthey happened to be by themselves, but merely gazed at her. Natasha\nlifted her frightened eyes to him, but there was such confident\ntenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not,\nwhilst looking at him, say what she had to say. She lowered her eyes.\n\n\"Don\'t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,\"\nshe said rapidly.... She glanced at him.\n\nAnatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.\n\n\"Don\'t speak to me of that! What can I do?\" said he. \"I tell you I\nam madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are\nenchanting?... It\'s our turn to begin.\"\n\nNatasha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open\nfrightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly\nanything that went on that evening. They danced the ecossaise and\nthe Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to\nremain. Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt\nhis eyes upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her\nfather to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that\nHelene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother\'s love,\nand that she again met Anatole in the little sitting room. Helene\nhad disappeared leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and\nsaid in a tender voice:\n\n\"I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never\nsee you? I love you madly. Can I never...?\" and, blocking her path, he\nbrought his face close to hers.\n\nHis large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she\nsaw nothing but them.\n\n\"Natalie?\" he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being\npainfully pressed. \"Natalie?\"\n\n\"I don\'t understand. I have nothing to say,\" her eyes replied.\n\nBurning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she\nfelt herself released, and Helene\'s footsteps and the rustle of her\ndress were heard in the room. Natasha looked round at her, and then,\nred and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and\nmoved toward the door.\n\n\"One word, just one, for God\'s sake!\" cried Anatole.\n\nShe paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to\nher what had happened and to which she could find no answer.\n\n\"Natalie, just a word, only one!\" he kept repeating, evidently not\nknowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene came up to them.\n\nHelene returned with Natasha to the drawing room. The Rostovs went\naway without staying for supper.\n\nAfter reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night. She was\ntormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or\nPrince Andrew. She loved Prince Andrew--she remembered distinctly\nhow deeply she loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there\nwas no doubt. \"Else how could all this have happened?\" thought she.\n\"If, after that, I could return his smile when saying good-by, if I\nwas able to let it come to that, it means that I loved him from the\nfirst. It means that he is kind, noble, and splendid, and I could\nnot help loving him. What am I to do if I love him and the other one\ntoo?\" she asked herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible\nquestions.');

Everyone got up and began to\nmove about and talk, dressmakers came again. Marya Dmitrievna\nappeared, and they were called to breakfast. Natasha kept looking\nuneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to\nintercept every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the\nsame as usual.\n\nAfter breakfast, which was her best time, Marya Dmitrievna sat\ndown in her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her.\n\n\"Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is\nmy advice,\" she began. \"Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince\nBolkonski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to\nbegin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had\nto say!\"\n\n\"Well, and he?\" asked the count.\n\n\"He? He\'s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what\'s the use\nof talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,\" said Marya\nDmitrievna. \"My advice to you is finish your business and go back home\nto Otradnoe... and wait there.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Natasha.\n\n\"Yes, go back,\" said Marya Dmitrievna, \"and wait there. If your\nbetrothed comes here now--there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but\nalone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to\nyou.\"\n\nCount Rostov approved of this suggestion, appreciating its\nreasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better\nto visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the\nwedding, against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otradnoe.\n\n\"That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took\nher,\" said the old count.\n\n\"No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But\nif he won\'t--that\'s his affair,\" said Marya Dmitrievna, looking for\nsomething in her reticule. \"Besides, the trousseau is ready, so\nthere is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I\'ll send after\nyou. Though I don\'t like letting you go, it is the best way. So go,\nwith God\'s blessing!\"\n\nHaving found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed\nit to Natasha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.\n\n\"She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She\'s\nafraid you might think that she does not like you.\"\n\n\"But she doesn\'t like me,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"Don\'t talk nonsense!\" cried Marya Dmitrievna.\n\n\"I shan\'t believe anyone, I know she doesn\'t like me,\" replied\nNatasha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold\nand angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her\nmore intently and to frown.\n\n\"Don\'t answer like that, my good girl!\" she said. \"What I say is\ntrue! Write an answer!\" Natasha did not reply and went to her own room\nto read Princess Mary\'s letter.\n\nPrincess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the\nmisunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father\'s\nfeelings might be, she begged Natasha to believe that she could not\nhelp loving her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose\nhappiness she was ready to sacrifice everything.\n\n\"Do not think, however,\" she wrote, \"that my father is\nill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be\nforgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes\nhis son happy.\" Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time\nwhen she could see her again.\n\nAfter reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to\nanswer it. \"Dear Princess,\" she wrote in French quickly and\nmechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all\nthat had happened the evening before? \"Yes, yes! All that has\nhappened, and now all is changed,\" she thought as she sat with the\nletter she had begun before her. \"Must I break off with him? Must I\nreally? That\'s awful...\" and to escape from these dreadful thoughts\nshe went to Sonya and began sorting patterns with her.\n\nAfter dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess\nMary\'s letter. \"Can it be that it is all over?\" she thought. \"Can it\nbe that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that\nwent before?\" She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its\nformer strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin. She\nvividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew\'s wife, and the scenes of\nhappiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and\nat the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of\nyesterday\'s interview with Anatole.\n\n\"Why could that not be as well?\" she sometimes asked herself in\ncomplete bewilderment. \"Only so could I be completely happy; but now I\nhave to choose, and I can\'t be happy without either of them. Only,\"\nshe thought, \"to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it\nfrom him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is\nspoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew\'s\nlove, in which I have lived so long?\"\n\n\"Please, Miss!\" whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious\nair. \"A man told me to give you this-\" and she handed Natasha a\nletter.\n\n\"Only, for Christ\'s sake...\" the girl went on, as Natasha, without\nthinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from\nAnatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only\nthat it was a letter from him--from the man she loved. Yes, she\nloved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?\nAnd how could she have a love letter from him in her hand?\n\nWith trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter\nwhich Dolokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she\nfound in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.\n\n\"Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you\nor to die. There is no other way for me,\" the letter began. Then he\nwent on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him--for\nthis there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her--but that\nif she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power\ncould hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her\naway and carry her off to the ends of the earth.\n\n\"Yes, yes! I love him!\" thought Natasha, reading the letter for\nthe twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each\nword of it.\n\nThat evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs\' and\nproposed to take the girls with her. Natasha, pleading a headache,\nremained at home.');

Open\non the table, beside her lay Anatole\'s letter. Sonya picked it up\nand read it.\n\nAs she read she glanced at the sleeping Natasha, trying to find in\nher face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find\nit. Her face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep\nherself from choking, Sonya, pale and trembling with fear and\nagitation, sat down in an armchair and burst into tears.\n\n\"How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she\nhave left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kuragin go\nto such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that\'s plain! What\nwill Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is\nthe meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before\nyesterday, yesterday, and today,\" thought Sonya. \"But it can\'t be that\nshe loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who it\nwas from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a\nthing!\"\n\nSonya wiped away her tears and went up to Natasha, again scanning\nher face.\n\n\"Natasha!\" she said, just audibly.\n\nNatasha awoke and saw Sonya.\n\n\"Ah, you\'re back?\"\n\nAnd with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment\nof awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sonya\'s look of\nembarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.\n\n\"Sonya, you\'ve read that letter?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Sonya softly.\n\nNatasha smiled rapturously.\n\n\"No, Sonya, I can\'t any longer!\" she said. \"I can\'t hide it from you\nany longer. You know, we love one another! Sonya, darling, he\nwrites... Sonya...\"\n\nSonya stared open-eyed at Natasha, unable to believe her ears.\n\n\"And Bolkonski?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ah, Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!\" cried Natasha. \"You\ndon\'t know what love is....\"\n\n\"But, Natasha, can that be all over?\"\n\nNatasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not\ngrasp the question.\n\n\"Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?\" said Sonya.\n\n\"Oh, you don\'t understand anything! Don\'t talk nonsense, just\nlisten!\" said Natasha, with momentary vexation.\n\n\"But I can\'t believe it,\" insisted Sonya. \"I don\'t understand. How\nis it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you\nhave only seen him three times! Natasha, I don\'t believe you, you\'re\njoking! In three days to forget everything and so...\"\n\n\"Three days?\" said Natasha. \"It seems to me I\'ve loved him a hundred\nyears. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can\'t\nunderstand it.... Sonya, wait a bit, sit here,\" and Natasha embraced\nand kissed her.\n\n\"I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it\ntoo, but it\'s only now that I feel such love. It\'s not the same as\nbefore. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his\nslave, and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave!\nWhatever he orders I shall do. You don\'t understand that. What can I\ndo? What can I do, Sonya?\" cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened\nexpression.\n\n\"But think what you are doing,\" cried Sonya. \"I can\'t leave it\nlike this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so\nfar?\" she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.\n\n\"I told you that I have no will,\" Natasha replied. \"Why can\'t you\nunderstand? I love him!\"\n\n\"Then I won\'t let it come to that... I shall tell!\" cried Sonya,\nbursting into tears.\n\n\"What do you mean? For God\'s sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!\"\ndeclared Natasha. \"You want me to be miserable, you want us to be\nseparated....\"\n\nWhen she saw Natasha\'s fright, Sonya shed tears of shame and pity\nfor her friend.\n\n\"But what has happened between you?\" she asked. \"What has he said to\nyou? Why doesn\'t he come to the house?\"\n\nNatasha did not answer her questions.\n\n\"For God\'s sake, Sonya, don\'t tell anyone, don\'t torture me,\"\nNatasha entreated. \"Remember no one ought to interfere in such\nmatters! I have confided in you....\"\n\n\"But why this secrecy? Why doesn\'t he come to the house?\" asked\nSonya. \"Why doesn\'t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince\nAndrew gave you complete freedom--if it is really so; but I don\'t\nbelieve it! Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can\nbe?\"\n\nNatasha looked at Sonya with astonishment. Evidently this question\npresented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know\nhow to answer it.\n\n\"I don\'t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!\"\n\nSonya sighed and shook her head incredulously.\n\n\"If there were reasons...\" she began.\n\nBut Natasha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.\n\n\"Sonya, one can\'t doubt him! One can\'t, one can\'t! Don\'t you\nunderstand?\" she cried.\n\n\"Does he love you?\"\n\n\"Does he love me?\" Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her\nfriend\'s lack of comprehension. \"Why, you have read his letter and you\nhave seen him.\"\n\n\"But if he is dishonorable?\"\n\n\"He! dishonorable? If you only knew!\" exclaimed Natasha.\n\n\"If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions\nor cease seeing you; and if you won\'t do this, I will. I will write to\nhim, and I will tell Papa!\" said Sonya resolutely.\n\n\"But I can\'t live without him!\" cried Natasha.\n\n\"Natasha, I don\'t understand you. And what are you saying! Think\nof your father and of Nicholas.\"\n\n\"I don\'t want anyone, I don\'t love anyone but him. How dare you\nsay he is dishonorable? Don\'t you know that I love him?\" screamed\nNatasha. \"Go away, Sonya! I don\'t want to quarrel with you, but go,\nfor God\'s sake go! You see how I am suffering!\" Natasha cried angrily,\nin a voice of despair and repressed irritation. Sonya burst into\nsobs and ran from the room.\n\nNatasha went to the table and without a moment\'s reflection wrote\nthat answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all\nthe morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their\nmisunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the\nmagnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her\nfreedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her\nif she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife.\nAt that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Natasha.\n\n\nOn Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country, but on\nWednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his\nestate near Moscow.\n\nOn the day the count left, Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big\ndinner party at the Karagins\', and Marya Dmitrievna took them there.\nAt that party Natasha again met Anatole, and Sonya noticed that she\nspoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through\ndinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home Natasha was\nthe first to begin the explanation Sonya expected.\n\n\"There, Sonya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,\"\nNatasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to\nbe praised. \"We have had an explanation today.\"\n\n\"Well, what happened? What did he say? Natasha, how glad I am you\'re\nnot angry with me! Tell me everything--the whole truth. What did he\nsay?\"\n\nNatasha became thoughtful.\n\n\"Oh, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I\nhad promised Bolkonski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.\"\n\nSonya sighed sorrowfully.\n\n\"But you haven\'t refused Bolkonski?\" said she.\n\n\"Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski. Why\ndo you think so badly of me?\"\n\n\"I don\'t think anything, only I don\'t understand this...\"\n\n\"Wait a bit, Sonya, you\'ll understand everything. You\'ll see what\na man he is! Now don\'t think badly of me or of him. I don\'t think\nbadly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?\"\n\nSonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her.\nThe more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha\'s face\nbecame, the more serious and stern grew Sonya\'s.\n\n\"Natasha,\" said she, \"you asked me not to speak to you, and I\nhaven\'t spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don\'t trust him,\nNatasha. Why this secrecy?\"\n\n\"Again, again!\" interrupted Natasha.\n\n\"Natasha, I am afraid for you!\"\n\n\"Afraid of what?\"\n\n\"I am afraid you\'re going to your ruin,\" said Sonya resolutely,\nand was herself horrified at what she had said.\n\nAnger again showed in Natasha\'s face.\n\n\"And I\'ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It\'s not\nyour business! It won\'t be you, but I, who\'ll suffer. Leave me\nalone, leave me alone! I hate you!\"\n\n\"Natasha!\" moaned Sonya, aghast.\n\n\"I hate you, I hate you! You\'re my enemy forever!\" And Natasha ran\nout of the room.\n\nNatasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her. With the\nsame expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the\nhouse, taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once\nabandoning them.\n\nHard as it was for Sonya, she watched her friend and did not let her\nout of her sight.\n\nThe day before the count was to return, Sonya noticed that Natasha\nsat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting\nsomething and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past,\nwhom Sonya took to be Anatole.\n\nSonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed\nthat at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and\nunnatural state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she\ndid not finish, and laughed at everything.\n\nAfter tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha\'s door timidly\nwaiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at\nthe door learned that another letter had been delivered.\n\nThen suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some\ndreadful plan for that evening. Sonya knocked at her door. Natasha did\nnot let her in.\n\n\"She will run away with him!\" thought Sonya. \"She is capable of\nanything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in\nher face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,\" Sonya\nremembered. \"Yes, that\'s it, she means to elope with him, but what\nam I to do?\" thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly\nindicated that Natasha had some terrible intention. \"The count is\naway. What am I to do? Write to Kuragin demanding an explanation?\nBut what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince\nAndrew asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she\nreally has already refused Bolkonski--she sent a letter to Princess\nMary yesterday. And Uncle is away....\" To tell Marya Dmitrievna who\nhad such faith in Natasha seemed to Sonya terrible. \"Well, anyway,\"\nthought Sonya as she stood in the dark passage, \"now or never I must\nprove that I remember the family\'s goodness to me and that I love\nNicholas. Yes! If I don\'t sleep for three nights I\'ll not leave this\npassage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the\nfamily be disgraced,\" thought she.');

The plan for Natalie\nRostova\'s abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by\nDolokhov a few days before, and on the day that Sonya, after listening\nat Natasha\'s door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been\nput into execution. Natasha had promised to come out to Kuragin at the\nback porch at ten that evening. Kuragin was to put her into a troyka\nhe would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of\nKamenka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a\nmarriage ceremony over them. At Kamenka a relay of horses was to\nwait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they\nwould hasten abroad with post horses.\n\nAnatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand\nrubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand\nborrowed with Dolokhov\'s help.\n\nTwo witnesses for the mock marriage--Khvostikov, a retired petty\nofficial whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and\nMakarin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an\nunbounded affection for Kuragin--were sitting at tea in Dolokhov\'s\nfront room.\n\nIn his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with\nPersian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dolokhov in a traveling\ncloak and high boots, at an open desk on which lay abacus and some\nbundles of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to\nand fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the\nstudy to the room behind, where his French valet and others were\npacking the last of his things. Dolokhov was counting the money and\nnoting something down.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"Khvostikov must have two thousand.\"\n\n\"Give it to him, then,\" said Anatole.\n\n\"Makarka\" (their name for Makarin) \"will go through fire and water\nfor you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,\" said\nDolokhov, showing him the memorandum. \"Is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" returned Anatole, evidently not listening to\nDolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not\nleave his face.\n\nDolokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an\nironic smile:\n\n\"Do you know? You\'d really better drop it all. There\'s still time!\"\n\n\"Fool,\" retorted Anatole. \"Don\'t talk nonsense! If you only\nknew... it\'s the devil knows what!\"\n\n\"No, really, give it up!\" said Dolokhov. \"I am speaking seriously.\nIt\'s no joke, this plot you\'ve hatched.\"\n\n\"What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\" said Anatole, making a\ngrimace. \"Really it\'s no time for your stupid jokes,\" and he left\nthe room.\n\nDolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole\nhad gone out.\n\n\"You wait a bit,\" he called after him. \"I\'m not joking, I\'m\ntalking sense. Come here, come here!\"\n\nAnatole returned and looked at Dolokhov, trying to give him his\nattention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.\n\n\"Now listen to me. I\'m telling you this for the last time. Why\nshould I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything\nfor you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the\nmoney? I did it all.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?\" And\nAnatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov.\n\n\"I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a\ndangerous business, and if you think about it--a stupid business.\nWell, you\'ll carry her off--all right! Will they let it stop at\nthat? It will come out that you\'re already married. Why, they\'ll\nhave you in the criminal court....\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense, nonsense!\" Anatole ejaculated and again made a\ngrimace. \"Didn\'t I explain to you? What?\" And Anatole, with the\npartiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have\nreached by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already\nput to Dolokhov a hundred times. \"Didn\'t I explain to you that I\nhave come to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,\" he went\non, crooking one finger, \"then I have nothing to answer for; but if it\nis valid, no matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it.\nIsn\'t that so? And don\'t talk to me, don\'t, don\'t.\"\n\n\"Seriously, you\'d better drop it! You\'ll only get yourself into a\nmess!\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the\nroom, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of\nDolokhov with his feet turned under him. \"It\'s the very devil! What?\nFeel how it beats!\" He took Dolokhov\'s hand and put it on his heart.\n\"What a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!\" he added in\nFrench. \"What?\"\n\nDolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes\nlooked at him--evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of\nhim.\n\n\"Well and when the money\'s gone, what then?\"\n\n\"What then? Eh?\" repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a\nthought of the future. \"What then?... Then, I don\'t know.... But why\ntalk nonsense!\" He glanced at his watch. \"It\'s time!\"\n\nAnatole went into the back room.\n\n\"Now then! Nearly ready? You\'re dawdling!\" he shouted to the\nservants.\n\nDolokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to\nbring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went\ninto the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting.\n\nAnatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and\nsmiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to\nhimself.\n\n\"Come and eat something. Have a drink!\" Dolokhov shouted to him from\nthe other room.\n\n\"I don\'t want to,\" answered Anatole continuing to smile.\n\n\"Come! Balaga is here.\"\n\nAnatole rose and went into the dining room. Balaga was a famous\ntroyka driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and\nhad given them good service with his troykas. More than once when\nAnatole\'s regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in\nthe evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back\nagain the next night. More than once he had enabled Dolokhov to escape\nwhen pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town\nwith gypsies and \"ladykins\" as he called the cocottes. More than\nonce in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles\nin the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the\nconsequences by \"my gentlemen\" as he called them. He had ruined more\nthan one horse in their service. More than once they had beaten him,\nand more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira,\nwhich he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of them\nwhich would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They\noften called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance\nat the gypsies\', and more than one thousand rubles of their money\nhad passed through his hands. In their service he risked his skin\nand his life twenty times a year, and in their service had lost more\nhorses than the money he had from them would buy. But he liked them;\nliked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a\ndriver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full gallop through\nthe Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind\nhim: \"Get on! Get on!\" when it was impossible to go any faster. He\nliked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead\nthan alive, was already hurrying out of his way. \"Real gentlemen!\"\nhe considered them.\n\nAnatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and\nbecause he liked the things they liked. With others Balaga\nbargained, charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours\' drive, and\nrarely drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But\nwith \"his gentlemen\" he always drove himself and never demanded\nanything for his work. Only a couple of times a year--when he knew\nfrom their valets that they had money in hand--he would turn up of a\nmorning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him.\nThe gentlemen always made him sit down.\n\n\"Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir,\" or \"your excellency,\" he\nwould say. \"I am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to go\nto the fair.\"\n\nAnd Anatole and Dolokhov, when they had money, would give him a\nthousand or a couple of thousand rubles.\n\nBalaga was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about\ntwenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck,\nglittering little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine,\ndark-blue, silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin.\n\nOn entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the\nfront corner of the room, and went up to Dolokhov, holding out a\nsmall, black hand.\n\n\"Theodore Ivanych!\" he said, bowing.\n\n\"How d\'you do, friend? Well, here he is!\"\n\n\"Good day, your excellency!\" he said, again holding out his hand\nto Anatole who had just come in.\n\n\"I say, Balaga,\" said Anatole, putting his hands on the man\'s\nshoulders, \"do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....\nWhat horses have you come with? Eh?\"\n\n\"As your messenger ordered, your special beasts,\" replied Balaga.\n\n\"Well, listen, Balaga! Drive all three to death but get me there\nin three hours. Eh?\"\n\n\"When they are dead, what shall I drive?\" said Balaga with a wink.\n\n\"Mind, I\'ll smash your face in! Don\'t make jokes!\" cried Anatole,\nsuddenly rolling his eyes.\n\n\"Why joke?\" said the driver, laughing. \"As if I\'d grudge my\ngentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast\nwe\'ll go!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Anatole. \"Well, sit down.\"\n\n\"Yes, sit down!\" said Dolokhov.\n\n\"I\'ll stand, Theodore Ivanych.\"\n\n\"Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!\" said Anatole, and filled a large\nglass of Madeira for him.\n\nThe driver\'s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After\nrefusing it for manners\' sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with\na red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap.\n\n\"And when are we to start, your excellency?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Anatole looked at his watch. \"We\'ll start at once. Mind,\nBalaga! You\'ll get there in time? Eh?\"\n\n\"That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn\'t we be\nthere in time?\" replied Balaga. \"Didn\'t we get you to Tver in seven\nhours? I think you remember that, your excellency?\"\n\n\"Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,\" said Anatole,\nsmilingly at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed\nrapturously at him with wide-open eyes. \"Will you believe it, Makarka,\nit took one\'s breath away, the rate we flew. We came across a train of\nloaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?\"\n\n\"Those were horses!\" Balaga continued the tale. \"That time I\'d\nharnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,\" he went\non, turning to Dolokhov. \"Will you believe it, Theodore Ivanych, those\nanimals flew forty miles? I couldn\'t hold them in, my hands grew\nnumb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins--\'Catch hold\nyourself, your excellency!\' says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom\nof the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn\'t a case of urging them\non, there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils\ntook us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.\"');

Having\nlooked in a mirror, and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he\nhad assumed before it, he lifted a glass of wine.\n\n\"Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!\"\nsaid Anatole. \"Well, comrades and friends...\" he considered for a\nmoment \"...of my youth, farewell!\" he said, turning to Makarin and the\nothers.\n\nThough they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to\nmake something touching and solemn out of this address to his\ncomrades. He spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest\nslightly swayed one leg.\n\n\"All take glasses; you too, Balaga. Well, comrades and friends of my\nyouth, we\'ve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when\nshall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time--now\nfarewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...\" he cried, and emptying\nhis glass flung it on the floor.\n\n\"To your health!\" said Balaga who also emptied his glass, and\nwiped his mouth with his handkerchief.\n\nMakarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!\n\n\"Let\'s go. Let\'s go!\" cried Anatole.\n\nBalaga was about to leave the room.\n\n\"No, stop!\" said Anatole. \"Shut the door; we have first to sit down.\nThat\'s the way.\"\n\nThey shut the door and all sat down.\n\n\"Now, quick march, lads!\" said Anatole, rising.\n\nJoseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all\nwent out into the vestibule.\n\n\"And where\'s the fur cloak?\" asked Dolokhov. \"Hey, Ignatka! Go to\nMatrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what\nelopements are like,\" continued Dolokhov with a wink. \"Why, she\'ll\nrush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if\nyou delay at all there\'ll be tears and \'Papa\' and \'Mamma,\' and she\'s\nfrozen in a minute and must go back--but you wrap the fur cloak\nround her first thing and carry her to the sleigh.\"\n\nThe valet brought a woman\'s fox-lined cloak.\n\n\"Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrena, the sable!\" he\nshouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms.\n\nA handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black\neyes and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a\nsable mantle on her arm.\n\n\"Here, I don\'t grudge it--take it!\" she said, evidently afraid of\nher master and yet regretful of her cloak.\n\nDolokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over\nMatrena, and wrapped her up in it.\n\n\"That\'s the way,\" said Dolokhov, \"and then so!\" and he turned the\ncollar up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered.\n\"And then so, do you see?\" and he pushed Anatole\'s head forward to\nmeet the gap left by the collar, through which Matrena\'s brilliant\nsmile was seen.\n\n\"Well, good-by, Matrena,\" said Anatole, kissing her. \"Ah, my\nrevels here are over. Remember me to Steshka. There, good-by! Good-by,\nMatrena, wish me luck!\"\n\n\"Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!\" said Matrena in her\ngypsy accent.\n\nTwo troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers\nwere holding the horses. Balaga took his seat in the front one and\nholding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and\nDolokhov got in with him. Makarin, Khvostikov, and a valet seated\nthemselves in the other sleigh.\n\n\"Well, are you ready?\" asked Balaga.\n\n\"Go!\" he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka\ntore down the Nikitski Boulevard.\n\n\"Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...\" The shouting of Balaga\nand of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be\nheard. On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage;\nsomething cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the\nArbat Street.\n\nAfter taking a turn along the Podnovinski Boulevard, Balaga began to\nrein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old\nKonyusheny Street.\n\nThe young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and\nAnatole and Dolokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the\ngate Dolokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant\nran out.\n\n\"Come into the courtyard or you\'ll be seen; she\'ll come out\ndirectly,\" said she.\n\nDolokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the\ncourtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.\n\nHe was met by Gabriel, Marya Dmitrievna\'s gigantic footman.\n\n\"Come to the mistress, please,\" said the footman in his deep bass,\nintercepting any retreat.\n\n\"To what Mistress? Who are you?\" asked Anatole in a breathless\nwhisper.\n\n\"Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.\"\n\n\"Kuragin! Come back!\" shouted Dolokhov. \"Betrayed! Back!\"\n\nDolokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and\nwas struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it.

Toward\nmidnight she went to Natasha\'s room fingering the key in her pocket.\nSonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. \"Marya Dmitrievna, for\nGod\'s sake let me in to her!\" she pleaded, but Marya Dmitrievna\nunlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer....\n\"Disgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I\'m only\nsorry for her father!\" thought she, trying to restrain her wrath.\n\"Hard as it may be, I\'ll tell them all to hold their tongues and\nwill hide it from the count.\" She entered the room with resolute\nsteps. Natasha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and\nshe did not stir. She was in just the same position in which Marya\nDmitrievna had left her.\n\n\"A nice girl! Very nice!\" said Marya Dmitrievna. \"Arranging meetings\nwith lovers in my house! It\'s no use pretending: you listen when I\nspeak to you!\" And Marya Dmitrievna touched her arm. \"Listen when I\nspeak! You\'ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I\'d treat\nyou differently, but I\'m sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.\"\n\nNatasha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved\nwith noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Marya Dmitrievna\nglanced round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha.\n\n\"It\'s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I\'ll find him!\" she said\nin her rough voice. \"Do you hear what I am saying or not?\" she added.\n\nShe put her large hand under Natasha\'s face and turned it toward\nher. Both Marya Dmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they saw how\nNatasha looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed,\nher cheeks sunken.\n\n\"Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!\" she muttered,\nwrenching herself from Marya Dmitrievna\'s hands with a vicious\neffort and sinking down again into her former position.\n\n\"Natalie!\" said Marya Dmitrievna. \"I wish for your good.

He, your father, I know him... if he\nchallenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why?

Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it?\nSonya, why?... Go away!\"\n\nAnd she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which\npeople bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned.\nMarya Dmitrievna was to speak again but Natasha cried out:\n\n\"Go away! Go away!

Natasha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she\ngrew cold and had a shivering fit. Marya Dmitrievna put a pillow under\nher head, covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some\nlime-flower water, but Natasha did not respond to her.\n\n\"Well, let her sleep,\" said Marya Dmitrievna as she went out of the\nroom supposing Natasha to be asleep.\n\nBut Natasha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open\neyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not\nsleep or weep and did not speak to Sonya who got up and went to her\nseveral times.\n\nNext day Count Rostov returned from his estate near Moscow in time\nfor lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the\naffair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was\nnothing to keep him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess\nwhom he missed. Marya Dmitrievna met him and told him that Natasha had\nbeen very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor,\nbut that she was better now. Natasha had not left her room that\nmorning. With compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she\nsat at the window, uneasily watching the people who drove past and\nhurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room. She was\nevidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would\nwrite to her.\n\nWhen the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the\nsound of a man\'s footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and\nmalevolent expression. She did not even get up to greet him. \"What\nis the matter with you, my angel? Are you ill?\" asked the count.\n\nAfter a moment\'s silence Natasha answered: \"Yes, ill.\"\n\nIn reply to the count\'s anxious inquiries as to why she was so\ndejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she\nassured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry.\nMarya Dmitrievna confirmed Natasha\'s assurances that nothing had\nhappened. From the pretense of illness, from his daughter\'s\ndistress, and by the embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya\nDmitrievna, the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during\nhis absence, but it was so terrible for him to think that anything\ndisgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter, and he so prized his\nown cheerful tranquillity, that he avoided inquiries and tried to\nassure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and he was only\ndissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the\ncountry.');

Soon after the Rostovs\ncame to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him hasten to\ncarry out his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexeevich\'s\nwidow, who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers\nof her deceased husband\'s.\n\nWhen he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya\nDmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great\nimportance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed. Pierre\nhad been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling\nfor her was stronger than a married man\'s should be for his friend\'s\nfiancee. Yet some fate constantly threw them together.\n\n\"What can have happened? And what can they want with me?\" thought he\nas he dressed to go to Marya Dmitrievna\'s. \"If only Prince Andrew\nwould hurry up and come and marry her!\" thought he on his way to the\nhouse.\n\nOn the Tverskoy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.\n\n\"Pierre! Been back long?\" someone shouted. Pierre raised his head.\nIn a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering\nthe dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makarin\ndashed past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of\nmilitary dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver\ncollar and his head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his\nwhite-plumed hat, tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded\nhair besprinkled with powdery snow.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, that\'s a true sage,\" thought Pierre. \"He sees\nnothing beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so\nhe is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn\'t I give\nto be like him!\" he thought enviously.\n\nIn Marya Dmitrievna\'s anteroom the footman who helped him off with\nhis fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.\n\nWhen he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natasha sitting at the\nwindow, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at\nhim, frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked Pierre, entering Marya Dmitrievna\'s room.\n\n\"Fine doings!\" answered Dmitrievna. \"For fifty-eight years have I\nlived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!\"\n\nAnd having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,\nMarya Dmitrievna informed him that Natasha had refused Prince Andrew\nwithout her parents\' knowledge and that the cause of this was\nAnatole Kuragin into whose society Pierre\'s wife had thrown her and\nwith whom Natasha had tried to elope during her father\'s absence, in\norder to be married secretly.\n\nPierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was\ntold him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince\nAndrew\'s deeply loved affianced wife--the same Natasha Rostova who\nused to be so charming--should give up Bolkonski for that fool Anatole\nwho was already secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in\nlove with him as to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre\ncould not conceive and could not imagine.\n\nHe could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natasha,\nwhom he had known from a child, with this new conception of her\nbaseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. \"They are all\nalike!\" he said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man\nunfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied\nPrince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded\npride, and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with\ncontempt and even with disgust of that Natasha who had just passed him\nin the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that\nNatasha\'s soul was overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation,\nand that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an\nexpression of calm dignity and severity.\n\n\"But how get married?\" said Pierre, in answer to Marya Dmitrievna.\n\"He could not marry--he is married!\"\n\n\"Things get worse from hour to hour!\" ejaculated Marya Dmitrievna.\n\"A nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she\'s expecting him--expecting\nhim since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won\'t go on\nexpecting him.\"\n\nAfter hearing the details of Anatole\'s marriage from Pierre, and\ngiving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Marya\nDmitrievna told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that\nthe count or Bolkonski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew\nof this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge\nAnatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his\nbrother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set\neyes on him again. Pierre--only now realizing the danger to the old\ncount, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew--promised to do as she wished.\nHaving briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him, she let him go\nto the drawing room.\n\n\"Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing\neither,\" she said. \"And I will go and tell her it is no use\nexpecting him! And stay to dinner if you care to!\" she called after\nPierre.\n\nPierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning\nNatasha had told him that she had rejected Bolkonski.\n\n\"Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!\" he said to Pierre. \"What\ntroubles one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret\nhaving come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she\nhas broken off her engagement without consulting anybody? It\'s true\nthis engagement never was much to my liking. Of course he is an\nexcellent man, but still, with his father\'s disapproval they\nwouldn\'t have been happy, and Natasha won\'t lack suitors. Still, it\nhas been going on so long, and to take such a step without father\'s or\nmother\'s consent! And now she\'s ill, and God knows what! It\'s hard,\nCount, hard to manage daughters in their mother\'s absence....\"\n\nPierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the\nsubject, but the count returned to his troubles.\n\nSonya entered the room with an agitated face.\n\n\"Natasha is not quite well; she\'s in her room and would like to\nsee you. Marya Dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkonski\'s, no doubt she wants to\nsend him a message,\" said the count. \"Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it\nall was!\"\n\nAnd clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the\nroom.\n\nWhen Marya Dmitrievna told Natasha that Anatole was married, Natasha\ndid not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by\nPierre himself. Sonya told Pierre this as she led him along the\ncorridor to Natasha\'s room.\n\nNatasha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Marya Dmitrievna, and\nher eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look\nthe moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed\nfixedly at him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or\nlike the others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he\nevidently did not exist for her.\n\n\"He knows all about it,\" said Marya Dmitrievna pointing to Pierre\nand addressing Natasha. \"Let him tell you whether I have told the\ntruth.\"\n\nNatasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded\nanimal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.\n\n\"Natalya Ilynichna,\" Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a\nfeeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do,\n\"whether it is true or not should make no difference to you,\nbecause...\"\n\n\"Then it is not true that he\'s married!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is true.\"\n\n\"Has he been married long?\" she asked. \"On your honor?...\"\n\nPierre gave his word of honor.\n\n\"Is he still here?\" she asked, quickly.\n\n\"Yes, I have just seen him.\"\n\nShe was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands\nthat they should leave her alone.');

He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kuragin, at the\nthought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a\ndifficulty in breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the\ngypsies\', nor at Komoneno\'s. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all\nwas going on as usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were\nsitting about in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town\nnews. The footman having greeted him, knowing his habits and his\nacquaintances, told him there was a place left for him in the small\ndining room and that Prince Michael Zakharych was in the library,\nbut Paul Timofeevich had not yet arrived. One of Pierre\'s\nacquaintances, while they were talking about the weather, asked if\nhe had heard of Kuragin\'s abduction of Rostova which was talked of\nin the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it was\nnonsense for he had just come from the Rostovs\'. He asked everyone\nabout Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and another\nthat he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this calm,\nindifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his\nsoul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come,\nand as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove\nhome.\n\nAnatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with\nDolokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate\naffair. It seemed to him essential to see Natasha. In the evening he\ndrove to his sister\'s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting.\nWhen Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his\nvalet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The\ncountess\' drawing room was full of guests.\n\nPierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his\nreturn--at that moment she was more repulsive to him than\never--entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.\n\n\"Ah, Pierre,\" said the countess going up to her husband. \"You\ndon\'t know what a plight our Anatole...\"\n\nShe stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\'s head,\nin his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of\nthat rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced\nafter his duel with Dolokhov.\n\n\"Where you are, there is vice and evil!\" said Pierre to his wife.\n\"Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\" he added in French.\n\nAnatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready\nto follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward\nhimself and was leading him from the room.\n\n\"If you allow yourself in my drawing room...\" whispered Helene,\nbut Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.\n\nAnatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face\nbetrayed anxiety.\n\nHaving entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed\nAnatole without looking at him.\n\n\"You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to\nelope with her, is that so?\"\n\n\"Mon cher,\" answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in\nFrench), \"I don\'t consider myself bound to answer questions put to\nme in that tone.\"\n\nPierre\'s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized\nAnatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him\nfrom side to side till Anatole\'s face showed a sufficient degree of\nterror.\n\n\"When I tell you that I must talk to you!...\" repeated Pierre.\n\n\"Come now, this is stupid. What?\" said Anatole, fingering a button\nof his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.\n\n\"You\'re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don\'t know what deprives\nme from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!\" said Pierre,\nexpressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.\n\nHe took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once\nput it back in its place.\n\n\"Did you promise to marry her?\"\n\n\"I... I didn\'t think of it. I never promised, because...\"\n\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\"Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?\" he said, moving\ntoward Anatole.\n\nAnatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his\npocket and drew out his pocketbook.\n\nPierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table\nthat stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.\n\n\"I shan\'t be violent, don\'t be afraid!\" said Pierre in answer to a\nfrightened gesture of Anatole\'s. \"First, the letters,\" said he, as\nif repeating a lesson to himself. \"Secondly,\" he continued after a\nshort pause, again rising and again pacing the room, \"tomorrow you\nmust get out of Moscow.\"\n\n\"But how can I?...\"\n\n\"Thirdly,\" Pierre continued without listening to him, \"you must\nnever breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess\nRostova. I know I can\'t prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark\nof conscience...\" Pierre paced the room several times in silence.\n\nAnatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.\n\n\"After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there\nis such a thing as other people\'s happiness and peace, and that you\nare ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse\nyourself with women like my wife--with them you are within your\nrights, for they know what you want of them. They are armed against\nyou by the same experience of debauchery; but to promise a maid to\nmarry her... to deceive, to kidnap.... Don\'t you understand that it is\nas mean as beating an old man or a child?...\"\n\nPierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with\na questioning look.\n\n\"I don\'t know about that, eh?\" said Anatole, growing more\nconfident as Pierre mastered his wrath. \"I don\'t know that and don\'t\nwant to,\" he said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of\nhis lower jaw, \"but you have used such words to me--\'mean\' and so\non--which as a man of honor I can\'t allow anyone to use.\"\n\nPierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he\nwanted.\n\n\"Though it was tete-a-tete,\" Anatole continued, \"still I can\'t...\"\n\n\"Is it satisfaction you want?\" said Pierre ironically.\n\n\"You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do\nas you wish, eh?\"\n\n\"I take them back, I take them back!\" said Pierre, \"and I ask you to\nforgive me.\" Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. \"And if\nyou require money for your journey...\"\n\nAnatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile,\nwhich Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.\n\n\"Oh, vile and heartless brood!\" he exclaimed, and left the room.\n\nNext day Anatole left for Petersburg.');

The whole\nhouse was in a state of alarm and commotion. Natasha was very ill,\nhaving, as Marya Dmitrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the\nnight after she had been told that Anatole was married, with some\narsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she had\nbeen so frightened that she woke Sonya and told her what she had done.\nThe necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was\nnow out of danger, though still so weak that it was out of the\nquestion to move her to the country, and so the countess had been sent\nfor. Pierre saw the distracted count, and Sonya, who had a\ntear-stained face, but he could not see Natasha.\n\nPierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip\nabout the attempted abduction of Rostova. He resolutely denied these\nrumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his\nbrother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to\nPierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and\nre-establish Natasha\'s reputation.\n\nHe was awaiting Prince Andrew\'s return with dread and went every day\nto the old prince\'s for news of him.\n\nOld Prince Bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from\nMademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which\nNatasha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits\nthan usual and awaited his son with great impatience.\n\nSome days after Anatole\'s departure Pierre received a note from\nPrince Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come\nto see him.\n\nAs soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his\nfather Natasha\'s note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement\n(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and\ngiven it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of\nNatasha\'s elopement, with additions.\n\nPrince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see\nhim next morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost\nthe same state as Natasha and was therefore surprised on entering\nthe drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated\nvoice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince\'s\nvoice and another now and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out\nto meet Pierre. She sighed, looking toward the door of the room\nwhere Prince Andrew was, evidently intending to express her sympathy\nwith his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her face that she was glad both\nat what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news\nof Natasha\'s faithlessness.\n\n\"He says he expected it,\" she remarked. \"I know his pride will not\nlet him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far\nbetter, than I expected. Evidently it had to be....\"\n\n\"But is it possible that all is really ended?\" asked Pierre.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not\nunderstand how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the\nstudy. Prince Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health,\nbut with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in\ncivilian dress facing his father and Prince Meshcherski, warmly\ndisputing and vigorously gesticulating. The conversation was about\nSperanski--the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had\njust reached Moscow.\n\n\"Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about\nhim a month ago,\" Prince Andrew was saying, \"and by those who were\nunable to understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and\nto throw on him all the blame of other men\'s mistakes is very easy,\nbut I maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this\nreign it was done by him, by him alone.\"\n\nHe paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and\nimmediately assumed a vindictive expression.\n\n\"Posterity will do him justice,\" he concluded, and at once turned to\nPierre.\n\n\"Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?\" he said with\nanimation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. \"Yes, I am\nwell,\" he said in answer to Pierre\'s question, and smiled.\n\nTo Pierre that smile said plainly: \"I am well, but my health is\nnow of no use to anyone.\"\n\nAfter a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish\nfrontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre,\nand about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his\nson\'s tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation\nabout Speranski which was still going on between the two old men.\n\n\"If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,\nthey would have been made public,\" he said with warmth and haste. \"I\ndo not, and never did, like Speranski personally, but I like justice!\"\n\nPierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only\ntoo familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous\nmatters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too\nintimate. When Prince Meshcherski had left, Prince Andrew took\nPierre\'s arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A\nbed had been made up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks\nstood about. Prince Andrew went to one and took out a small casket,\nfrom which he drew a packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently\nand very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his\nlips compressed.\n\n\"Forgive me for troubling you...\"\n\nPierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natasha, and his\nbroad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated\nPrince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he\ncontinued:\n\n\"I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard\nreports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of\nthat kind. Is that true?\"\n\n\"Both true and untrue,\" Pierre began; but Prince Andrew\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"Here are her letters and her portrait,\" said he.\n\nHe took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.\n\n\"Give this to the countess... if you see her.\"\n\n\"She is very ill,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Then she is here still?\" said Prince Andrew. \"And Prince\nKuragin?\" he added quickly.\n\n\"He left long ago. She has been at death\'s door.\"\n\n\"I much regret her illness,\" said Prince Andrew; and he smiled\nlike his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.\n\n\"So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova with his\nhand?\" said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.\n\n\"He could not marry, for he was married already,\" said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his\nfather.\n\n\"And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\" he said.\n\n\"He has gone to Peters... But I don\'t know,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Well, it doesn\'t matter,\" said Prince Andrew. \"Tell Countess\nRostova that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all\nthat is good.\"\n\nPierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember\nwhether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre\nwould say anything, looked fixedly at him.\n\n\"I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?\" asked Pierre,\n\"about...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Prince Andrew hastily. \"I said that a fallen woman\nshould be forgiven, but I didn\'t say I could forgive her. I can\'t.\"\n\n\"But can this be compared...?\" said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: \"Yes, ask her\nhand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very\nnoble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman\'s footsteps. If you\nwish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well,\ngood-by. So you\'ll give her the packet?\"\n\nPierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.\n\nThe old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same\nas always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed\nher satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at\nthem Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the\nRostovs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to\nmention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone\nelse.\n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was\nbecoming evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with\nhis father, now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an\nunnatural animation, the cause of which Pierre so well understood.');

Natasha was in bed, the count at the\nClub, and Pierre, after giving the letters to Sonya, went to Marya\nDmitrievna who was interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken\nthe news. Ten minutes later Sonya came to Marya Dmitrievna.\n\n\"Natasha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirilovich,\" said she.\n\n\"But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not\nbeen tidied up.\"\n\n\"No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,\" said Sonya.\n\nMarya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind,\ndon\'t tell her everything!\" said she to Pierre. \"One hasn\'t the\nheart to scold her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be\npitied.\"\n\nNatasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated,\nwith a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected\nto find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently\nundecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.\n\nPierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as\nusual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her\narms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she\nwent to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different\nexpression of face.\n\n\"Peter Kirilovich,\" she began rapidly, \"Prince Bolkonski was your\nfriend--is your friend,\" she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that\neverything that had once been must now be different.) \"He told me once\nto apply to you...\"\n\nPierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then\nhe had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he\nnow felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for\nreproach.\n\n\"He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!\" She stopped\nand breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.\n\n\"Yes... I will tell him,\" answered Pierre; \"but...\"\n\nHe did not know what to say.\n\nNatasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think\nshe had meant.\n\n\"No, I know all is over,\" she said hurriedly. \"No, that can never\nbe. I\'m only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only\nthat I beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....\"\n\nShe trembled all over and sat down on a chair.\n\nA sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre\'s heart.\n\n\"I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,\" said\nPierre. \"But... I should like to know one thing....\"\n\n\"Know what?\" Natasha\'s eyes asked.\n\n\"I should like to know, did you love...\" Pierre did not know how\nto refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him--\"did you love\nthat bad man?\"\n\n\"Don\'t call him bad!\" said Natasha. \"But I don\'t know, don\'t know at\nall....\"\n\nShe began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness,\nand love welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his\nspectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.\n\n\"We won\'t speak of it any more, my dear,\" said Pierre, and his\ngentle, cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natasha.\n\n\"We won\'t speak of it, my dear--I\'ll tell him everything; but one\nthing I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help,\nadvice, or simply to open your heart to someone--not now, but when\nyour mind is clearer think of me!\" He took her hand and kissed it.\n\"I shall be happy if it\'s in my power...\"\n\nPierre grew confused.\n\n\"Don\'t speak to me like that. I am not worth it!\" exclaimed\nNatasha and turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.\n\nHe knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it\nhe was amazed at his own words.\n\n\"Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you,\" said he to her.\n\n\"Before me? No! All is over for me,\" she replied with shame and\nself-abasement.\n\n \"All over?\" he repeated. \"If I were not myself, but the handsomest,\ncleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this\nmoment ask on my knees for your hand and your love!\"\n\nFor the first time for many days Natasha wept tears of gratitude and\ntenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.\n\nPierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom,\nrestraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without\nfinding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his\nsleigh.\n\n\"Where to now, your excellency?\" asked the coachman.\n\n\"Where to?\" Pierre asked himself. \"Where can I go now? Surely not to\nthe Club or to pay calls?\" All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in\ncomparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in\ncomparison with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him\nthrough her tears.\n\n\"Home!\" said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost\nFahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and\ninhaled the air with joy.\n\nIt was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the\nblack roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky\ndid Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane\nthings compared with the heights to which his soul had just been\nraised. At the entrance to the Arbat Square an immense expanse of dark\nstarry sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it,\nabove the Prechistenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all\nsides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the\nearth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous\nand brilliant comet of 1812--the comet which was said to portend all\nkinds of woes and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet\nwith its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the\ncontrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright\ncomet which, having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity\nthrough immeasurable space, seemed suddenly--like an arrow piercing\nthe earth--to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its\ntail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless\nother scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet fully\nresponded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul,\nnow blossoming into a new life.');

On the\ntwelfth of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe crossed the\nRussian frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed\nto human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated\nagainst one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries,\nthefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms,\nand murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of\nall the law courts of the world, but which those who committed them\ndid not at the time regard as being crimes.\n\nWhat produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes?\nThe historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the\nwrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the\nContinental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of\nAlexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.\n\nConsequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,\nRumyantsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to\nhave taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for\nNapoleon to have written to Alexander: \"My respected Brother, I\nconsent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg\"--and there\nwould have been no war.\n\nWe can understand that the matter seemed like that to\ncontemporaries. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was\ncaused by England\'s intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St.\nHelena). It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that\nthe cause of the war was Napoleon\'s ambition; to the Duke of\nOldenburg, that the cause of the war was the violence done to him;\nto businessmen that the cause of the war was the Continental System\nwhich was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the\nchief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them\nemployment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of\nre-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that\ntime that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between\nRussia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed\nfrom Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178.\nIt is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of\nother reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points\nof view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to\nposterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and\nperceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem\ninsufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of\nChristian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon\nwas ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England\'s policy was\nastute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what\nconnection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter\nand violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men\nfrom the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smolensk\nand Moscow and were killed by them.\n\nTo us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried\naway by the process of research and can therefore regard the event\nwith unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes\npresent themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes\nthe more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of\ncauses appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by\nits insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its\nimpotence--apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident\ncauses--to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or\nthat French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as\nNapoleon\'s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to\nrestore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and\nhad a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also\nrefused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\'s army and\nthe war could not have occurred.\n\nHad Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw\nbeyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would\nhave been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a\nsecond term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there\nhave been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of\nOldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been\nan autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a\nsubsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced\nthe French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing\ncould have happened. So all these causes--myriads of causes--coincided\nto bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that\noccurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men,\nrenouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to\neast to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes\nof men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.\n\nThe actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed\nto hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who\nwas drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not\nbe otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on\nwhom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the\nconcurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of\nwhich the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that\nmillions of men in whose hands lay the real power--the soldiers who\nfired, or transported provisions and guns--should consent to carry out\nthe will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do\nso by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.\n\nWe are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of\nirrational events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of\nwhich we do not understand). The more we try to explain such events in\nhistory reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they\nbecome to us.\n\nEach man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal\naims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain\nfrom doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that\naction performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and\nbelongs to history, in which it has not a free but a predestined\nsignificance.\n\nThere are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life,\nwhich is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his\nelemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for\nhim.\n\nMan lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious\ninstrument in the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of\nhumanity. A deed done is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in\ntime with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic\nsignificance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more\npeople he is connected with and the more power he has over others, the\nmore evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every\naction.\n\n\"The king\'s heart is in the hands of the Lord.\"\n\nA king is history\'s slave.\n\nHistory, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind,\nuses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.\n\nThough Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever\nthat it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses\npeuples*--as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote\nhim--he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which\ncompelled him, while thinking that he was acting on his own volition,\nto perform for the hive life--that is to say, for history--whatever\nhad to be performed.\n\n\n*\"To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.\"\n\n\nThe people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and\nby the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and\nco-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the\nnonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg\'s\nwrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia--undertaken (as it\nseemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace,\nthe French Emperor\'s love and habit of war coinciding with his\npeople\'s inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations,\nand the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining\nadvantages to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors\nhe received in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the\nopinion of contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to\nattain peace, but which only wounded the self-love of both sides,\nand millions of other causes that adapted themselves to\nthe event that was happening or coincided with it.\n\nWhen an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of\nits attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it\nis dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes\nit, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it?\n\nNothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions\nin which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the\nbotanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue\ndecays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under\nthe tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and\nprayed for it. Equally right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon\nwent to Moscow because he wanted to, and perished because Alexander\ndesired his destruction, and he who says that an undermined hill\nweighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for\nthe last time with his mattock. In historic events the so-called great\nmen are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but\nthe smallest connection with the event itself.\n\nEvery act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will,\nis in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole\ncourse of history and predestined from eternity.');

Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the\nemperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings\nand princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and\ndiamonds of his own--that is, which he had taken from other kings--to\nthe Empress of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us,\ntenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise--who regarded him as her\nhusband, though he had left another wife in Paris--left her grieved by\nthe parting which she seemed hardly able to bear. Though the\ndiplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and\nworked zealously to that end, and though the Emperor Napoleon himself\nwrote a letter to Alexander, calling him Monsieur mon frere, and\nsincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love\nand honor him--yet he set off to join his army, and at every station\ngave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west\nto east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses, surrounded by\npages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to Posen, Thorn,\nDanzig, and Konigsberg. At each of these towns thousands of people met\nhim with excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nThe army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses\ncarried him in the same direction. On the tenth of June,* coming up\nwith the army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on\nthe estate of a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.\n\n\n*Old style.\n\n\nNext day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the\nNiemen, and, changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank\nin order to select a place for the crossing.\n\nSeeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the\nwide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of\nMoscow (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the\nScythia into which Alexander the Great had marched--Napoleon\nunexpectedly, and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic\nconsiderations, ordered an advance, and the next day his army began to\ncross the Niemen.\n\nEarly in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,\nwhich was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and\nlooked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out\nof the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown\nacross the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor\'s presence,\nwere on the lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in\nan overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of\nhis tent on the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: \"Vive\nl\'Empereur!\" and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of\nthe vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and\non by the three bridges to the other side.\n\n\"Now we\'ll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself,\nthings get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l\'Empereur! So\nthese are the steppes of Asia! It\'s a nasty country all the same. Au\nrevoir, Beauche; I\'ll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au\nrevoir. Good luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l\'Empereur!...\npreur!--If they make me Governor of India, Gerard, I\'ll make you\nMinister of Kashmir--that\'s settled. Vive l\'Empereur! Hurrah!\nhurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks--those rascals--see how they run! Vive\nl\'Empereur! There he is, do you see him? I\'ve seen him twice, as I see\nyou now. The little corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the\nveterans.... Vive l\'Empereur!\" came the voices of men, old and\nyoung, of most diverse characters and social positions. On the faces\nof all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the\nlong-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the\ngray coat who was standing on the hill.\n\nOn the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse\nwas brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one\nof the bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant\nand rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because\nit was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of\nhim by such shouting, but the shouting which accompanied him\neverywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares\nthat had occupied him from the time he joined the army. He rode across\none of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side, turned sharply\nto the left, and galloped in the direction of Kovno, preceded by\nenraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard who, breathless with\ndelight, galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops. On\nreaching the broad river Viliya, he stopped near a regiment of\nPolish Uhlans stationed by the river.\n\n\"Vivat!\" shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and\npressing against one another to see him.\n\nNapoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a\nlog that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was\nhanded him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run\nup to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became\nabsorbed in a map laid out on the logs. Without lifting his head he\nsaid something, and two of his aides-de-camp galloped off to the\nPolish Uhlans.\n\n\"What? What did he say?\" was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans\nwhen one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.\n\nThe order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel\nof the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his\nspeech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be\npermitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford.\nIn evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on\na horse, he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the\nEmperor\'s eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor\nwould not be displeased at this excess of zeal.\n\nAs soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached\nofficer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted\n\"Vivat!\" and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse\nand galloped into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse,\nwhich had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading\nfor the deepest part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans\ngalloped in after him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in\nthe middle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as\nthey fell off their horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some\nof the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some\nclinging to their horses\' manes. They tried to make their way\nforward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford one third of\na mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this\nriver under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even\nlooking at what they were doing. When the aide-de-camp, having\nreturned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the\nEmperor\'s attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the\nlittle man in the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned\nBerthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving him\ninstructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the\ndrowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.\n\nFor him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of\nthe world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough\nto dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called\nfor his horse and rode to his quarters.\n\nSome forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were\nsent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from\nwhich they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and\nwith difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they\nhad got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted\n\"Vivat!\" and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been\nbut where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves\nhappy.\n\nThat evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian\npaper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as\nquickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a\nletter containing information about the orders to the French army\nhad been found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish\ncolonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled\nin the Legion d\'honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.\n\nQuos vult perdere dementat.*\n\n\n*Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad.');

Nothing was ready for\nthe war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor\nhad come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The\nvacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even\nincreased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each\nof the three armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no\nsupreme commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume\nthat responsibility himself.\n\nThe longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody--tired\nof waiting--prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded\nthe sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time\npleasantly and forget that war was impending.\n\nIn June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by\nthe courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the\nPolish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be\ngiven for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly\nreceived. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected\nmoney by subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to\nthe Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a\nlandowner in the Vilna province, offered his country house for the\nfete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner,\nregatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen\'s country seat.\n\nThe very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and\nhis vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian\nfrontier, Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by\nhis aides-de-camp at Bennigsen\'s country house.\n\nIt was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters\ndeclared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one\nplace. Countess Bezukhova was present among other Russian ladies who\nhad followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vilna and eclipsed the\nrefined Polish ladies by her massive, so called Russian type of\nbeauty. The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.\n\nBoris Drubetskoy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the\npresent en garcon (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not\nan aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Boris\nwas now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought\npatronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of\nhis own age. He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen\nher for a long time and did not recall the past, but as Helene was\nenjoying the favors of a very important personage and Boris had only\nrecently married, they met as good friends of long standing.\n\nAt midnight dancing was still going on. Helene, not having a\nsuitable partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Boris.\nThey were the third couple. Boris, coolly looking at Helene\'s dazzling\nbare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze\ngown, talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware\nof it himself and unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased\nto observe the Emperor who was in the same room. The Emperor was not\ndancing, he stood in the doorway, stopping now one pair and now\nanother with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter.\n\nAs the mazurka began, Boris saw that Adjutant General Balashev,\none of those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him\nand contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to\na Polish lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked\ninquiringly at Balashev and, evidently understanding that he only\nacted thus because there were important reasons for so doing, nodded\nslightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly had Balashev begun to\nspeak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor\'s face. He\ntook Balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him,\nunconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both\nsides made way for him. Boris noticed Arakcheev\'s excited face when\nthe sovereign went out with Balashev. Arakcheev looked at the\nEmperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped\nforward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him.\n(Boris understood that Arakcheev envied Balashev and was displeased\nthat evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than\nthrough himself.)\n\nBut the Emperor and Balashev passed out into the illuminated\ngarden without noticing Arakcheev who, holding his sword and\nglancing wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.\n\nAll the time Boris was going through the figures of the mazurka,\nhe was worried by the question of what news Balashev had brought and\nhow he could find it out before others. In the figure in which he\nhad to choose two ladies, he whispered to Helene that he meant to\nchoose Countess Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the\nveranda, and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the\ngarden, where, seeing Balashev and the Emperor returning to the\nveranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. Boris,\nfluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw, respectfully pressed\nclose to the doorpost with bowed head.\n\nThe Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally\naffronted, was finishing with these words:\n\n\"To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as\nlong as a single armed enemy remains in my country!\" It seemed to\nBoris that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was\nsatisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but\ndispleased that Boris had overheard it.\n\n\"Let no one know of it!\" the Emperor added with a frown.\n\nBoris understood that this was meant for him and, closing his\neyes, slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and\nremained there about another half-hour.\n\nBoris was thus the first to learn the news that the French army\nhad crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain\nimportant personages that much that was concealed from others was\nusually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their\nestimation.\n\n\nThe unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was\nparticularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations,\nand at a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of\nindignation and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased\nhim, fully expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On\nreturning home at two o\'clock that night he sent for his secretary,\nShishkov, and told him to write an order to the troops and a\nrescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltykov, in which he insisted on the\nwords being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a\nsingle armed Frenchman remained on Russian soil.\n\nNext day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:\n\n\nMonsieur mon frere,\n\nYesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept my\nengagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian\nfrontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in\nwhich Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression,\nthat Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with\nme from the time Prince Kuragin asked for his passports. The reasons\non which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him\nwould never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a\npretext for aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has\ndeclared, was never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I\nwas informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and\nordered him to remain at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend\nto shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding, and\nconsents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory, I will regard\nwhat has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us\nwill be possible. In the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see\nmyself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked.\nIt still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the\ncalamity of another war. I am, etc.,\n                                         (signed) Alexander');

When\ndispatching Balashev, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he\nwould not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on\nRussian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon.\nAlexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because\nwith his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use\nthem at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made,\nbut he definitely instructed Balashev to repeat them personally to\nNapoleon.\n\nHaving set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied\nby a bugler and two Cossacks, Balashev reached the French outposts\nat the village of Rykonty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn.\nThere he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.\n\nA French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform\nand a shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt.\nBalashev did not do so at once, but continued to advance along the\nroad at a walking pace.\n\nThe noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,\nadvanced his horse\'s chest against Balashev, put his hand to his\nsaber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he\ndeaf that he did not do as he was told? Balashev mentioned who he was.\nThe noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about\nregimental matters without looking at the Russian general.\n\nAfter living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after\nconversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in\ngeneral being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the\nservice, Balashev found it very strange here on Russian soil to\nencounter this hostile, and still more this disrespectful, application\nof brute force to himself.\n\nThe sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air\nwas fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road\nfrom the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one\nafter another, like bubbles rising in water.\n\nBalashev looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer\nfrom the village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French\nhussars looked silently at one another from time to time.\n\nA French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed,\ncame riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse,\naccompanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their\nhorses all looked smart and well kept.\n\nIt was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full\ntrim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of\nmartial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit\nof enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.\n\nThe French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was\npolite and evidently understood Balashev\'s importance. He led him past\nhis soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to\nbe presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied\nimmediately, as the Emperor\'s quarters were, he believed, not far off.\n\nThey rode through the village of Rykonty, past tethered French\nhussar horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and\nstared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the\nother end of the village. The colonel said that the commander of the\ndivision was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashev\nand conduct him to his destination.\n\nThe sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.\n\nThey had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a\ngroup of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a\nblack horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall\nman with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his\nshoulders. He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long legs forward\nin French fashion. This man rode toward Balashev at a gallop, his\nplumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright\nJune sunshine.\n\nBalashev was only two horses\' length from the equestrian with the\nbracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was\ngalloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when\nJulner, the French colonel, whispered respectfully: \"The King of\nNaples!\" It was, in fact, Murat, now called \"King of Naples.\" Though\nit was quite incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he\nwas called so, and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore\nassumed a more solemn and important air than formerly. He was so\nsure that he really was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of\nhis departure from that city, while walking through the streets with\nhis wife, some Italians called out to him: \"Viva il re!\"* he turned to\nhis wife with a pensive smile and said: \"Poor fellows, they don\'t know\nthat I am leaving them tomorrow!\"\n\n\n*\"Long live the king.\"\n\n\nBut though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and\npitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly,\nafter he had been ordered to return to military service--and\nespecially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when\nhis august brother-in-law had told him: \"I made you King that you\nshould reign in my way, but not in yours!\"--he had cheerfully taken up\nhis familiar business, and--like a well-fed but not overfat horse that\nfeels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts--he\ndressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible, and\ngaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of Poland, without\nhimself knowing why or whither.\n\nOn seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its\nlong hair curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner,\nand looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully\ninformed His Majesty of Balashev\'s mission, whose name he could not\npronounce.\n\n\"De Bal-macheve!\" said the King (overcoming by his assurance the\ndifficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). \"Charmed to make\nyour acquaintance, General!\" he added, with a gesture of kingly\ncondescension.\n\nAs soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity\ninstantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his\nnatural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the\nwithers of Balashev\'s horse and said:\n\n\"Well, General, it all looks like war,\" as if regretting a\ncircumstance of which he was unable to judge.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" replied Balashev, \"my master, the Emperor, does\nnot desire war and as Your Majesty sees...\" said Balashev, using the\nwords Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation\nunavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a\nnovelty.\n\nMurat\'s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to\n\"Monsieur de Bal-macheve.\" But royaute oblige!* and he felt it\nincumbent on him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs\nwith Alexander\'s envoy. He dismounted, took Balashev\'s arm, and moving\na few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to\npace up and down with him, trying to speak significantly. He\nreferred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand\nthat he should withdraw his troops from Prussia, especially when\nthat demand became generally known and the dignity of France was\nthereby offended.\n\n\n*\"Royalty has its obligations.\"\n\n\nBalashev replied that there was \"nothing offensive in the demand,\nbecause...\" but Murat interrupted him.\n\n\"Then you don\'t consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?\" he\nasked unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.\n\nBalashev told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of\nthe war.\n\n\"Oh, my dear general!\" Murat again interrupted him, \"with all my\nheart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and\nthat the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as\npossible!\" said he, in the tone of a servant who wants to remain\ngood friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters.\n\nAnd he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of\nhis health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had\nspent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal\ndignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which\nhe had stood at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:\n\n\"I won\'t detain you longer, General. I wish success to your\nmission,\" and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers,\nand his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were\nrespectfully awaiting him.\n\nBalashev rode on, supposing from Murat\'s words that he would very\nsoon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the\nnext village the sentinels of Davout\'s infantry corps detained him\nas the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the\ncorps commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to\nMarshal Davout.');

The chief pleasure\nand necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows\nanimation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity.\nDavout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashev was brought in.\nHe became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian general\nentered, and after glancing over his spectacles at Balashev\'s face,\nwhich was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with\nMurat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and\nsneered malevolently.\n\nWhen he noticed in Balashev\'s face the disagreeable impression\nthis reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked\nwhat he wanted.\n\nThinking he could have been received in such a manner only because\nDavout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor\nAlexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashev hastened to\ninform him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation,\nDavout, after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.\n\n\"Where is your dispatch?\" he inquired. \"Give it to me. I will send\nit to the Emperor.\"\n\nBalashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to\nthe Emperor.\n\n\"Your Emperor\'s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,\" said\nDavout, \"you must do as you\'re told.\"\n\nAnd, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his\ndependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer\non duty.\n\nBalashev took out the packet containing the Emperor\'s letter and\nlaid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging\non it, laid across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the\ninscription.\n\n\"You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,\"\nprotested Balashev, \"but permit me to observe that I have the honor to\nbe adjutant general to His Majesty....\"\n\nDavout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the\nsigns of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashev\'s face.\n\n\"You will be treated as is fitting,\" said he and, putting the packet\nin his pocket, left the shed.\n\nA minute later the marshal\'s adjutant, de Castres, came in and\nconducted Balashev to the quarters assigned him.\n\nThat day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the\nbarrels.\n\nNext day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashev to come to\nhim, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the\nbaggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one\nexcept Monsieur de Castres.\n\nAfter four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his\nimpotence and insignificance--particularly acute by contrast with\nthe sphere of power in which he had so lately moved--and after several\nmarches with the marshal\'s baggage and the French army, which occupied\nthe whole district, Balashev was brought to Vilna--now occupied by the\nFrench--through the very gate by which he had left it four days\npreviously.\n\nNext day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne,\ncame to Balashev and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon\'s wish to\nhonor him with an audience.\n\nFour days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment had\nstood in front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, and now\ntwo French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front\nand with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and\nUhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals,\nwho were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch,\nround his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received\nBalashev in the very house in Vilna from which Alexander had\ndispatched him on his mission.');

He stood a minute or two, waiting. He\nheard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened\nrapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of\nother steps, firm and resolute--they were those of Napoleon. He had\njust finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform,\nopening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his\nrotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat\nthighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had\nevidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of\nhis broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the\nblack collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His\nfull face, rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a\ngracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome.\n\nHe entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head\nslightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad\nthick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had\nthat imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live\nin comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits\nthat day.\n\nHe nodded in answer to Balashav\'s low and respectful bow, and coming\nup to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of\nhis time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but\nis sure he will always say the right thing and say it well.\n\n\"Good day, General!\" said he. \"I have received the letter you\nbrought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.\" He\nglanced with his large eyes into Balashav\'s face and immediately\nlooked past him.\n\nIt was plain that Balashev\'s personality did not interest him at\nall. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested\nhim. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because\neverything in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his\nwill.\n\n\"I do not, and did not, desire war,\" he continued, \"but it has\nbeen forced on me. Even now\" (he emphasized the word) \"I am ready to\nreceive any explanations you can give me.\"\n\nAnd he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for\ndissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly\nmoderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev\nwas firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter\ninto negotiations.\n\nWhen Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the\nRussian envoy, Balashev began a speech he had prepared long before:\n\"Sire! The Emperor, my master...\" but the sight of the Emperor\'s\neyes bent on him confused him. \"You are flurried--compose yourself!\"\nNapoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked\nat Balashev\'s uniform and sword.\n\nBalashev recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the\nEmperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin\'s demand for his\npassports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on his\nown initiative and without his sovereign\'s assent, that the Emperor\nAlexander did not desire war, and had no relations with England.\n\n\"Not yet!\" interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to\nhis feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev\nmight proceed.\n\nAfter saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashev added\nthat the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter\ninto negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashev hesitated:\nhe remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his\nletter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov and had\ntold Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered these\nwords, \"So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,\" but\nsome complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though\nhe wished to do so. He grew confused and said: \"On condition that\nthe French army retires beyond the Niemen.\"\n\nNapoleon noticed Balashev\'s embarrassment when uttering these last\nwords; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to\nquiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began\nspeaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the\nspeech that followed, Balashev, who more than once lowered his eyes,\ninvoluntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon\'s left leg which\nincreased the more Napoleon raised his voice.\n\n\"I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,\" he began.\n\"Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it?\nI have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to\nbegin negotiations, what is demanded of me?\" he said, frowning and\nmaking an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump\nhand.\n\n\"The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,\" replied\nBalashev.\n\n\"The Niemen?\" repeated Napoleon. \"So now you want me to retire\nbeyond the Niemen--only the Niemen?\" repeated Napoleon, looking\nstraight at Balashev.\n\nThe latter bowed his head respectfully.\n\nInstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from\nPomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded.\nNapoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.\n\n\"You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen\nbefore commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months\nago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the\nOder, and yet you are willing to negotiate.\"\n\nHe went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and\nagain stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev noticed that his left leg\nwas quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in\nits stern expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing\nNapoleon was conscious of. \"The vibration of my left calf is a great\nsign with me,\" he remarked at a later date.\n\n\"Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be\nmade to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!\" Napoleon almost screamed,\nquite to his own surprise. \"If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I\ncould not accept such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But\nwho first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer\nme negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in\nalliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You\noffer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with\nEngland? What has she given you?\" he continued hurriedly, evidently no\nlonger trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its\npossibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and\nAlexander\'s errors and duplicity.\n\nThe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the\nintention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and\nshowing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had\nbegun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his\nwords.\n\nThe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt\nhimself and insult Alexander--just what he had least desired at the\ncommencement of the interview.\n\n\"I hear you have made peace with Turkey?\"\n\nBalashev bowed his head affirmatively.\n\n\"Peace has been concluded...\" he began.\n\nBut Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all\nthe talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of\neloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so\nprone.\n\n\"Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining\nMoldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those\nprovinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,\" he went on, \"I promised and\nwould have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now\nhe won\'t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united\nthem to his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia\nfrom the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the\nGreat could not have done more,\" said Napoleon, growing more and\nmore excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashev\nalmost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. \"All\nthat, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!\"\nhe repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold\nsnuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.\n\n\"What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander\'s might have been!\"\n\nHe looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the latter\ntried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.\n\n\"What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained\nthrough my friendship?\" demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in\nperplexity. \"But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my\nenemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and\nWintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;\nArmfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French\nsubject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all\nthe same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who\nshould awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander\'s mind....\nGranted that were they competent they might be made use of,\" continued\nNapoleon--hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts\nthat incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in\nhis perception the two were one and the same)--\"but they are not even\nthat! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be\nthe most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his\nfirst movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel\nproposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called\non to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing\nno result. Bagration alone is a military man. He\'s stupid, but he has\nexperience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your\nyoung monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and\nthrow on him the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign\nshould not be with the army unless he is a general!\" said Napoleon,\nevidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor.\nHe knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander.\n\n\"The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven\'t even been\nable to defend Vilna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of\nthe Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Your Majesty,\" said Balashev, hardly able to\nremember what had been said to him and following these verbal\nfireworks with difficulty, \"the troops are burning with eagerness...\"\n\n\"I know everything!\" Napoleon interrupted him. \"I know everything. I\nknow the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You\nhave not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number.\nI give you my word of honor,\" said Napoleon, forgetting that his\nword of honor could carry no weight--\"I give you my word of honor that\nI have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the\nVistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing\nand have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes--it is\ntheir fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they\nchanged him for another--Bernadotte, who promptly went mad--for no\nSwede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.\"\n\nNapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his\nnose.\n\nBalashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon\'s remarks, and\nwould have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing\nto say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the\nalleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply that when\nRussia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon\ngave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that\nstate of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk,\nmerely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balashev began\nto feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and\nfelt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the\ntransport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He\nknew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any\nsignificance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them\nwhen he came to his senses. Balashev stood with downcast eyes, looking\nat the movements of Napoleon\'s stout legs and trying to avoid\nmeeting his eyes.\n\n\"But what do I care about your allies?\" said Napoleon. \"I have\nallies--the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight\nlike lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.\"\n\nAnd probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered\nthis obvious falsehood, and that Balashev still stood silently\nbefore him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon\nabruptly turned round, drew close to Balashev\'s face, and,\ngesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost\nshouted:\n\n\"Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I\'ll wipe it off the\nmap of Europe!\" he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and\nhe struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. \"Yes, I\nwill throw you back beyond the Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and\nwill re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind\nof Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to\nyou. That is what you have gained by alienating me!\" And he walked\nsilently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders\ntwitching.\n\nHe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again,\nlifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashev.\nHe paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev\'s eyes, and said\nin a quiet voice:\n\n\"And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!\"\n\nBalashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the\nRussian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon\nwas silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not\nlistening to him. Balashev said that in Russia the best results were\nexpected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to\nsay, \"I know it\'s your duty to say that, but you don\'t believe it\nyourself. I have convinced you.\"\n\nWhen Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox,\nsniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal.\nThe door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully,\nhanded the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket\nhandkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to\nBalashev:\n\n\"Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,\" said he, taking his hat,\n\"that I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very\nhighly esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer,\nGeneral; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor.\"\n\nAnd Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception\nroom rushed forward and descended the staircase.');

But, to his surprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an\ninvitation to dine with the Emperor that day.\n\nBessieres, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.\n\nNapoleon met Balashev cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed\nno sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that\nmorning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashev. It was\nevident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him\nto make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was\nright, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but\nbecause he did it.\n\nThe Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vilna,\nwhere crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him.\nFrom all the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs,\nflags, and his monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies,\nwelcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him.\n\nAt dinner, having placed Balashev beside him, Napoleon not only\ntreated him amiably but behaved as if Balashev were one of his own\ncourtiers, one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to\nrejoice at his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned\nMoscow and questioned Balashev about the Russian capital, not merely\nas an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit,\nbut as if convinced that Balashev, as a Russian, must be flattered\nby his curiosity.\n\n\"How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it\ntrue that Moscow is called \'Holy Moscow\'? How many churches are\nthere in Moscow?\" he asked.\n\nAnd receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred\nchurches, he remarked:\n\n\"Why such a quantity of churches?\"\n\n\"The Russians are very devout,\" replied Balashev.\n\n\"But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign\nof the backwardness of a people,\" said Napoleon, turning to\nCaulaincourt for appreciation of this remark.\n\nBalashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.\n\n\"Every country has its own character,\" said he.\n\n\"But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,\" said Napoleon.\n\n\"I beg your Majesty\'s pardon,\" returned Balashev, \"besides Russia\nthere is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.\"\n\nThis reply of Balashev\'s, which hinted at the recent defeats of\nthe French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at\nAlexander\'s court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon\'s\ndinner, where it passed unnoticed.\n\nThe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that\nthey were puzzled as to what Balashev\'s tone suggested. \"If there is a\npoint we don\'t see it, or it is not at all witty,\" their expressions\nseemed to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon\ndid not notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns\nthe direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashev, who was on\nthe alert all through the dinner, replied that just as \"all roads lead\nto Rome,\" so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and\n\"among them the road through Poltava, which Charles XII chose.\"\nBalashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this\nreply, but hardly had he uttered the word Poltava before\nCaulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg\nto Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.\n\nAfter dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon\'s study, which\nfour days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander.\nNapoleon sat down, toying with his Sevres coffee cup, and motioned\nBalashev to a chair beside him.\n\nNapoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than\nany reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to\nconsider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was\nsurrounded by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after\nhis dinner, Balashev too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned\nto him with a pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.\n\n\"They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied?\nStrange, isn\'t it, General?\" he said, evidently not doubting that this\nremark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his,\nNapoleon\'s, superiority to Alexander.\n\nBalashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence.\n\n\"Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were\ndeliberating,\" continued Napoleon with the same derisive and\nself-confident smile. \"What I can\'t understand,\" he went on, \"is\nthat the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal\nenemies. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do\nthe same?\" and he turned inquiringly to Balashev, and evidently this\nthought turned him back on to the track of his morning\'s anger,\nwhich was still fresh in him.\n\n\"And let him know that I will do so!\" said Napoleon, rising and\npushing his cup away with his hand. \"I\'ll drive all his Wurttemberg,\nBaden, and Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I\'ll drive them\nout. Let him prepare an asylum for them in Russia!\"\n\nBalashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to\nmake his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help\nhearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;\nhe treated Balashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now\nfully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master\'s\nhumiliation.\n\n\"And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What\nis the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to\nreign and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a\nresponsibility?\"\n\nAgain Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up\nand down the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly,\nwent up to Balashev and with a slight smile, as confidently,\nquickly, and simply as if he were doing something not merely\nimportant but pleasing to Balashev, he raised his hand to the\nforty-year-old Russian general\'s face and, taking him by the ear,\npulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.\n\nTo have one\'s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the\ngreatest honor and mark of favor at the French court.\n\n\"Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don\'t you\nsay anything?\" said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to\nbe the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. \"Are the\nhorses ready for the general?\" he added, with a slight inclination\nof his head in reply to Balashev\'s bow. \"Let him have mine, he has a\nlong way to go!\"\n\nThe letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon sent to\nAlexander. Every detail of the interview was communicated to the\nRussian monarch, and the war began...');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK NINE: 1812: CHAPTER VIII','After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to\nPetersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet\nAnatole Kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching\nPetersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had already left the\ncity. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on\nhis track. Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the\nMinister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in\nPetersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov, his former commander who was\nalways well disposed toward him, and Kutuzov suggested that he\nshould accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general\nhad been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having\nreceived an appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.\n\nPrince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge\nKuragin. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause\nit might compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he wanted to\nmeet Kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel.\nBut he again failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey, for soon after Prince\nAndrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. In a new country,\namid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After\nhis betrothed had broken faith with him--which he felt the more\nacutely the more he tried to conceal its effects--the surroundings\nin which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and\nindependence he had once prized so highly were still more so. Not only\ncould he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he\nlay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later\nenlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at\nBogucharovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to\nrecall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had\nrevealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters\nunrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more\neagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if\nthat lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above\nhim had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down,\nin which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.\n\nOf the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was\nthe simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutuzov\'s\nstaff, he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and\nsurprised Kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not\nhaving found Kuragin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it\nnecessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same he knew\nthat however long it might be before he met Kuragin, despite his\ncontempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince\nhimself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him--he knew\nthat when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him\nout, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food. And\nthe consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor\nwas still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial\ntranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of\nrestless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.\n\nIn the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached\nBucharest--where Kutuzov had been living for two months, passing his\ndays and nights with a Wallachian woman--Prince Andrew asked Kutuzov\nto transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who was already weary of\nBolkonski\'s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very\nreadily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.\n\nBefore joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped\nat Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on\nhis way, being only two miles off the Smolensk highroad. During the\nlast three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had\nthought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east\nand the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange\nand unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the\nsame in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone\npillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were\nentering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness,\nthe same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside\nthere was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and\nthe same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the\nsame timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and\njoylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant\nsuffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish,\nself-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full\nof joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more\nself-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had\nbrought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and\ntalking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same\nnarrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old\nprince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which\nleft a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was\nthe same as ever, only showing still more irritability and\nskepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas\nalone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair,\nand, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip\nof his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do.\nHe alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted,\nsleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the\ninner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew\nhad seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and\nhostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met\nbecause he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince,\nMademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess\nMary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.\n\nDuring his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but\nthey were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for\nwhose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them\nall feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first\nday, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became\nmorosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner.\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse\nhim, began to tell him of the young Count Kamensky\'s campaign, the old\nprince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for\nher superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he\nsaid, was the only person really attached to him.\n\nThe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of\nPrincess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and\nthat by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince\nNicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter\nand that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not\nhelp tormenting her and that she deserved it. \"Why does Prince Andrew,\nwho sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me\na scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own\ndaughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He\ndoesn\'t understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,\"\nthought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put\nup with his daughter\'s unreasonable character.\n\n\"If you ask me,\" said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was\ncensuring his father for the first time in his life), \"I did not\nwish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank\nopinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you\nand Mary, I can\'t blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and\nrespects you. Since you ask me,\" continued Prince Andrew, becoming\nirritable--as he was always liable to do of late--\"I can only say that\nif there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless\nwoman, who is not fit to be my sister\'s companion.\"\n\nThe old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural\nsmile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew\ncould not get accustomed.\n\n\"What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You\'ve already been talking it\nover! Eh?\"\n\n\"Father, I did not want to judge,\" said Prince Andrew, in a hard and\nbitter tone, \"but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall\nsay, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame--the one to\nblame--is that Frenchwoman.\"\n\n\"Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!\" said the old man\nin a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some\nembarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: \"Be off, be\noff! Let not a trace of you remain here!...\"\n\n\nPrince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded\nhim to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did\nnot leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne\nand Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next\nday, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son\'s rooms. The boy,\ncurly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,\nand Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell\ninto a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this\npretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He\nsought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or\nregret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms\nwith him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more\nto him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former\ntenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the\nboy and taking him on his knee.\n\n\"Well, go on!\" said his son.\n\nPrince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went\nout of the room.\n\nAs soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and\nespecially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he\nhad been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former\nintensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find\nsome work as soon as possible.\n\n\"So you\'ve decided to go, Andrew?\" asked his sister.\n\n\"Thank God that I can,\" replied Prince Andrew. \"I am very sorry\nyou can\'t.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" replied Princess Mary. \"Why do you say\nthat, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?\nMademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about you....\"\n\nAs soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her\ntears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the\nroom.\n\n\"Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what--what trash--can\ncause people misery!\" he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess\nMary.\n\nShe understood that when speaking of \"trash\" he referred not only to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man\nwho had ruined his own happiness.\n\n\"Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!\" she said, touching\nhis elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears.\n\"I understand you\" (she looked down). \"Don\'t imagine that sorrow is\nthe work of men. Men are His tools.\" She looked a little above\nPrince Andrew\'s head with the confident, accustomed look with which\none looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. \"Sorrow is\nsent by Him, not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to\nblame. If you think someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We\nhave no right to punish. And then you will know the happiness of\nforgiving.\"\n\n\"If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman\'s virtue.\nBut a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,\" he replied, and\nthough till that moment he had not been thinking of Kuragin, all his\nunexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.\n\n\"If Mary is already persuading me forgive, it means that I ought\nlong ago to have punished him,\" he thought. And giving her no\nfurther reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he\nwould meet Kuragin who he knew was now in the army.\n\nPrincess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she\nknew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being\nreconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably\nsoon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his\nfather, but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their\ndifferences would become.\n\n\"Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men\nare never to blame,\" were the last words he heard from his sister when\nhe took leave of her.\n\n\"Then it must be so!\" thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the\navenue from the house at Bald Hills. \"She, poor innocent creature,\nis left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits.\nThe old man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is\ngrowing up and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he\nwill deceive or be deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself\ndon\'t know. I want to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give\nhim a chance to kill and laugh at me!\"\n\nThese conditions of life had been the same before, but then they\nwere all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only\nsenseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after\nanother to Prince Andrew\'s mind.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK NINE: 1812: CHAPTER IX','Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the\nend of June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied\nthe fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying\nto effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be\ncut off by large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the\ngeneral course of affairs in the Russian army, but no one\nanticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces, and no\none thought the war would extend farther than the western, the Polish,\nprovinces.\n\nPrince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on\nthe bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large\nvillage in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals\nand courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of\nthe villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles.\nBarclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He\nreceived Bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign\naccent that he would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to\nhis employment, but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff.\nAnatole Kuragin, whom Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army,\nwas not there. He had gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad\nto hear this. His mind was occupied by the interests of the center\nthat was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a\nwhile from the distraction caused by the thought of Kuragin. During\nthe first four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince\nAndrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own\nknowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion\nabout it. But the question whether the camp was advantageous or\ndisadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his military\nexperience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come\nto the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no\nsignificance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of\nthe enemy--that cannot be foreseen--are met, and on how and by whom\nthe whole matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself,\nPrince Andrew, utilizing his position and acquaintances, tried to\nfathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and\nparties engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the following of the\nstate of affairs.\n\nWhile the Emperor had still been at Vilna, the forces had been\ndivided into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly,\nsecondly, the army under Bagration, and thirdly, the one commanded\nby Tormasov. The Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander\nin chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor\nwould take command, but only that he would be with the army. The\nEmperor, moreover, had with him not a commander in chief\'s staff but\nthe imperial headquarters staff. In attendance on him was the head\nof the imperial staff, Quartermaster General Prince Volkonski, as well\nas generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large\nnumber of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides these, there\nwere in attendance on the Emperor without any definite appointments:\nArakcheev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general\nin rank; the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich; Count\nRumyantsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister;\nArmfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of\ncampaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinian emigre;\nWolzogen--and many others. Though these men had no military\nappointment in the army, their position gave them influence, and often\na corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not know in\nwhat capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,\nArakcheev, or Prince Volkonski, or was given this or that advice and\ndid not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice\nemanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it\nhad to be executed or not. But this was only the external condition;\nthe essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all\nthese people, from a courtier\'s point of view (and in an Emperor\'s\nvicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this:\nthe Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but\ndisposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants.\nArakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the\nsovereign\'s bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna\nprovince who appeared to be doing the honors of the district, but\nwas in reality a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at\nhand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited\nhim to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was\nuseful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally.\nArmfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of\nself-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.\nPaulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The\nadjutants general were there because they always accompanied the\nEmperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn\nup the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander\nto believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole\nbusiness of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel\'s\nthoughts in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a\nharsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising\neveryone else) was able to do.\n\nBesides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and\nunexpected ideas every day--especially the foreigners, who did so with\na boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their\nown--there were many secondary personages accompanying the army\nbecause their principals were there.\n\nAmong the opinions and voices in this immense, restless,\nbrilliant, and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following\nsharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties:\n\nThe first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents--military\ntheorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws--laws\nof oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his\nadherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in\naccordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and\nthey saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every\ndeviation from that theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles,\nWolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.\n\nThe second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme,\nas always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The\nmembers of this party were those who had demanded an advance from\nVilna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides\nbeing advocates of bold action, this section also represented\nnationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They\nwere Russians: Bagration, Ermolov (who was beginning to come to the\nfront), and others. At that time a famous joke of Ermolov\'s was\nbeing circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the\nEmperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering\nSuvorov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins\ninto maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and\nnot let the army get discouraged.\n\nTo the third party--in which the Emperor had most confidence--belonged\nthe courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.\nThe members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakcheev\nbelonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish\nto seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war,\nparticularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him\nBonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound\nscientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at\nthe same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often\none sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but\nshould also listen to what Pfuel\'s opponents and practical men of\nexperience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course.\nThey insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to\nPfuel\'s plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies.\nThough, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be\nattained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.\n\nOf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the\nTsarevich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz,\nwhere he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and\ncavalry uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French\ngallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had\nnarrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of this party had\nboth the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They\nfeared Napoleon, recognized his strength and their own weakness, and\nfrankly said so. They said: \"Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin\nwill come of all this! We have abandoned Vilna and Vitebsk and shall\nabandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude\npeace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of Petersburg.\"\n\nThis view was very general in the upper army circles and found\nsupport also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyantsev, who,\nfor other reasons of state, was in favor of peace.\n\nThe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay\nde Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in\nchief. \"Be he what he may\" (they always began like that), \"he is an\nhonest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real\npower, for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of\ncommand, and he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our\narmy is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa\nwithout suffering any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If\nBarclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for\nBennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807.\"\n\nThe sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at\nany rate there was no one more active and experienced than\nBennigsen: \"and twist about as you may, you will have to come to\nBennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes now!\" said they,\narguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse\nand an unbroken series of blunders. \"The more mistakes that are made\nthe better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that\nthings cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or\nother, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to\nwhom Napoleon himself did justice--a man whose authority would be\nwillingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.\"\n\nThe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always\nto be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there\nwere particularly many round Alexander--generals and imperial\naides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a\nmonarch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as\nRostov had done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues\nbut all human capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with\nthe sovereign for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for\nsuch excessive modesty, and only desired and insisted that their\nadored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce\nthat he would place himself at the head of the army, gather round\nhim a commander in chief\'s staff, and, consulting experienced\ntheoreticians and practical men where necessary, would himself lead\nthe troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest\npitch.\n\nThe eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to\nthe others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither\npeace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa\nor anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor\nBennigsen, but only the one most essential thing--as much advantage\nand pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of\nconflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor\'s\nheadquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at\nother times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post\nwould today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the\nday after, merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor,\nwould declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who\nwished to gain some advantage would attract the Emperor\'s attention by\nloudly advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day\nbefore, and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast\nand challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby\nproving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good.\nA third, in the absence of opponents, between two councils would\nsimply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services, well\nknowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him.\nA fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come\naccidentally under the Emperor\'s eye. A fifth, to achieve his\nlong-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist\non the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for\nthis object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct.\n\nAll the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations,\nand promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of\nimperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction,\nthis whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way,\nso that it was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere.\nAmid the uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious\ndanger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid\nthis vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings,\nand the diversity of race among these people--this eighth and\nlargest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted\ngreat confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever question\narose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their\nbuzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum\ndrowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly.\n\nFrom among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached\nthe army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning\nto raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men\nexperienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any\nof those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of\nwhat was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means\nof escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.\n\nThe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong\nresulted chiefly from the Emperor\'s presence in the army with his\nmilitary court and from the consequent presence there of an\nindefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluctuation of relations,\nwhich is in place at court but harmful in an army; that a sovereign\nshould reign but not command the army, and that the only way out of\nthe position would be for the Emperor and his court to leave the army;\nthat the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the action of fifty\nthousand men required to secure his personal safety, and that the\nworst commander in chief if independent would be better than the\nvery best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch.\n\nJust at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,\nShishkov, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives\nof this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakcheev and\nBalashev agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of\npermission given him by the Emperor to discuss the general course of\naffairs, he respectfully suggested--on the plea that it was necessary\nfor the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the\ncapital--that the Emperor should leave the army.\n\nThat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to\nthem to defend their country--the very incitement which was the\nchief cause of Russia\'s triumph in so far as it was produced by the\nTsar\'s personal presence in Moscow--was suggested to the Emperor,\nand accepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the army.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK NINE: 1812: CHAPTER X','This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when\nBarclay, one day at dinner, informed Bolkonski that the sovereign\nwished to see him personally, to question him about Turkey, and that\nPrince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen\'s quarters at six\nthat evening.\n\nNews was received at the Emperor\'s quarters that very day of a fresh\nmovement by Napoleon which might endanger the army--news\nsubsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had\nridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had\npointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel,\nand till then considered a chef-d\'oeuvre of tactical science which\nwould ensure Napoleon\'s destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the\ndestruction of the Russian army.\n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen\'s quarters--a country gentleman\'s\nhouse of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river.\nNeither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernyshev, the\nEmperor\'s aide-de-camp, received Bolkonski and informed him that the\nEmperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had\ngone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the\nDrissa camp, of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning\nto be felt.\n\nChernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French\nnovel in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was\nstill an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one\ncorner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen\'s adjutant. This\nadjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding,\nevidently exhausted by work or by feasting. Two doors led from the\nroom, one straight on into what had been the drawing room, and\nanother, on the right, to the study. Through the first door came the\nsound of voices conversing in German and occasionally in French. In\nthat drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor\'s wish, not a military\ncouncil (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain persons\nwhose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending\ndifficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it were, a\ncouncil to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally.\nTo this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General Armfeldt,\nAdjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had referred\nto as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein who was\nnot a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew\nhad heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew had\nan opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon\nafter himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a\nminute to speak to Chernyshev.\n\nAt first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,\nwhich fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince\nAndrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about\nhim something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German\ntheorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more\ntypical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German\ntheorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united\nto such an extent.\n\nPfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust\nbuild, broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face\nwas much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been\nhastily brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in\nquaint little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and\nangrily around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment.\nAwkwardly holding up his sword, he addressed Chernyshev and asked in\nGerman where the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass\nthrough the rooms as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and\ngreetings, and sit down to business in front of a map, where he\nwould feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply to Chernyshev, and\nsmiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the\nfortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with his\ntheory. He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice,\nas self-assured Germans do--it might have been \"stupid fellow\"... or\n\"the whole affair will be ruined,\" or \"something absurd will come of\nit.\"... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed\non, but Chernyshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince\nAndrew was just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so\nfortunately. Pfuel barely glanced--not so much at Prince Andrew as\npast him--and said, with a laugh: \"That must have been a fine tactical\nwar\"; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room from which\nthe sound of voices was heard.\n\nPfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly\ndisturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect\nand criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with\nPfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to\nform a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and\nimmutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as\nonly Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of\nan abstract notion--science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute\ntruth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally,\nboth in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An\nEnglishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized state\nin the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows what he should\ndo and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An\nItalian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself\nand other people. A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing\nand does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that\nanything can be known. The German\'s self-assurance is worst of all,\nstronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he\nknows the truth--science--which he himself has invented but which is for\nhim the absolute truth.\n\nPfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science--the theory of\noblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the\nGreat\'s wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent\nwarfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous--monstrous collisions in\nwhich so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars\ncould not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and\ntherefore could not serve as material for science.\n\nIn 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of\ncampaign that ended in Jena and Auerstadt, but he did not see the\nleast proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of\nthat war. On the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were,\nin his opinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with\ncharacteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark, \"There, I said the\nwhole affair would go to the devil!\" Pfuel was one of those\ntheoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the\ntheory\'s object--its practical application. His love of theory made\nhim hate everything practical, and he would not listen to it. He was\neven pleased by failures, for failures resulting from deviations in\npractice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his\ntheory.\n\nHe said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about the\npresent war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all\nwill go wrong, and who is not displeased that it should be so. The\nunbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed\nhair on his temples expressed this most eloquently.\n\nHe passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of\nhis voice were at once heard from there.');

The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened\non to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.\nChernyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the\nEmperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was\ntalking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head\nbent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor\nmoved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the\nflushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and\ncontinued to speak.\n\n\"And as for the man who advised forming this camp--the Drissa camp,\"\nsaid Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince\nAndrew scanned his unfamiliar face, \"as to that person, sire...\"\ncontinued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain\nhimself, \"the man who advised the Drissa camp--I see no alternative\nbut the lunatic asylum or the gallows!\"\n\nWithout heeding the end of the Italian\'s remarks, and as though\nnot hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkonski, addressed him\ngraciously.\n\n\"I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting,\nand wait for me.\"\n\nThe Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter\nMikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind\nthem. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor\'s permission,\naccompanied Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing\nroom where the council was assembled.\n\nPrince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position, as it\nwere, of chief of the Emperor\'s staff. He came out of the study into\nthe drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put\nquestions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen\npresent. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to\nbe false) had been received during the night of a movement by the\nFrench to outflank the Drissa camp.\n\nThe first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty\nthat presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position\naway from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was\ninexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an\nopinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and\nthere await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that\nplan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions\nput--which, in fact, his plan did not answer--as to avail himself of\nthe opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals,\none as good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite\nunknown what character the war would take. Some disputed his\narguments, others defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the\nSwedish general\'s views more warmly than anyone else, and in the\ncourse of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled\nnotebook, which he asked permission to read to them. In these\nvoluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from\nArmfeldt\'s or Pfuel\'s plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci\nsuggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged, could alone\nextricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he\ncalled the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.\n\nDuring all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen\n(his \"bridge\" in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted\ncontemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean\nhimself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when\nPrince Volkonski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his\nopinion, he merely said:\n\n\"Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position\nwith an exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman\'s attack--very\nfine, or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?\" said he. \"Why, you\nyourselves know everything better than I do.\"\n\nBut when Volkonski said, with a frown, that it was in the\nEmperor\'s name that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly\ngrowing animated, began to speak:\n\n\"Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody\nthought they knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How\nmend matters? There is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me\nmust be strictly adhered to,\" said he, drumming on the table with\nhis bony fingers. \"What is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!\"\n\nHe went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no\neventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that\neverything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really\ngoing to outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.\n\nPaulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in\nFrench. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French\nbadly, and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with\nPfuel, who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had\nhappened, but all that could happen, had been foreseen in his\nscheme, and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault\nlay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed. He kept\nlaughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at last contemptuously\nceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who ceases to prove in\nvarious ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved.\nWolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in\nFrench, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, \"Is it not so,\nyour excellency?\" But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who\nstrikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at his own supporter,\nWolzogen:\n\n\"Well, of course, what more is there to explain?\"\n\nPaulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in\nFrench. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to\nVolkonski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.\n\nOf all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,\ndetermined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those\npresent, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself,\nnursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan,\nformed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out.\nHe was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired\ninvoluntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides\nthis, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had\nnot been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a\npanic fear of Napoleon\'s genius, which, though concealed, was\nnoticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible\nfor Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his\nterrible name to shatter each other\'s proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to\nconsider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his\ntheory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in\nPrince Andrew. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him\nand the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the\nEmperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel\'s own\nexpressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself\nfelt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and\ngrumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly\nbrushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he\nconcealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was\nevidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his\ntheory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole\nworld was slipping away from him.\n\nThe discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted\nthe more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and\npersonalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general\nconclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to\nthis polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and\nshouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought\nthat had long since and often occurred to him during his military\nactivities--the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of\nwar, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military\ngenius--now appeared to him an obvious truth. \"What theory and science\nis possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which\nare unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the\nacting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to\nforesee in what condition our or the enemy\'s armies will be in a day\'s\ntime, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment.\nSometimes--when there is not a coward at the front to shout, \'We are\ncut off!\' and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts,\n\'Hurrah!\'--a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand,\nas at Schon Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run from eight\nthousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in\nwhich, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and\neverything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of\nwhich is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one\nknows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says\nwe have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the\nworthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,\nand Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes\none plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the\nadvantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.\nAnd why do they all speak of a \'military genius\'? Is a man a genius\nwho can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who\nis to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military\nmen are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter\npower, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess.\nThe best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or\nabsent-minded men. Bagration was the best, Napoleon himself admitted\nthat. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied\nface on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander\nnot need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence\nof the highest and best human attributes--love, poetry, tenderness,\nand philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly\nconvinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will\nnot have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave\nleader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity,\nor think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a\ntheory of their \'genius\' was invented for them long ago because they\nhave power! The success of a military action depends not on them,\nbut on the man in the ranks who shouts, \'We are lost!\' or who\nshouts, \'Hurrah!\' And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance\nof being useful.\"\n\nSo thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he\nroused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.\n\nAt the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he\nwould like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court\ncircles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign\'s\nperson, but for permission to serve in the army.');

On receiving this letter,\nNicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to\nretire from the army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry\nNatasha was ill and her engagement broken off, and that he would do\nall he could to meet their wishes. To Sonya he wrote separately.\n\n\"Adored friend of my soul!\" he wrote. \"Nothing but honor could\nkeep me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of\nthe campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades\'\neyes but in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and\nduty to the Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe\nme, directly the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by\nyou, I will throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever\nto my ardent breast.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that\nprevented Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying\nSonya. The autumn in Otradnoe with the hunting, and the winter with\nthe Christmas holidays and Sonya\'s love, had opened out to him a vista\nof tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before,\nand which now allured him. \"A splendid wife, children, a good pack\nof hounds, a dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors,\nservice by election...\" thought he. But now the campaign was\nbeginning, and he had to remain with his regiment. And since it had to\nbe so, Nicholas Rostov, as was natural to him, felt contented with the\nlife he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that\nlife.\n\nOn his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully\nwelcomed by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back\nfrom the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him\ncommendation from his commanders. During his absence he had been\npromoted captain, and when the regiment was put on war footing with an\nincrease in numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.\n\nThe campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double\npay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody\nwas infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the\ncommencement of a war, and Rostov, conscious of his advantageous\nposition in the regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures\nand interests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later\nhe would have to relinquish them.\n\nThe troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons of\nstate, political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was\naccompanied by a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and\npassions at headquarters. For the Pavlograd hussars, however, the\nwhole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with\nsufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business.\n\nIt was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness,\nand intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves\nwhere they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat,\nit was only because they had to leave billets they had grown\naccustomed to, or some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that\nthings looked bad chanced to enter anyone\'s head, he tried to be as\ncheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general\ntrend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand. First they\ncamped gaily before Vilna, making acquaintance with the Polish\nlandowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor\nand other high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyani\nand destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them.\nSventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a\nname the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many\ncomplaints were made against the troops, who, taking advantage of\nthe order to collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, and\ncarpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostov remembered Sventsyani,\nbecause on the first day of their arrival at that small town he\nchanged his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken\nmen of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels\nof old beer. From Sventsyani they retired farther and farther to\nDrissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier\nof Russia proper.\n\nOn the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a serious\naction for the first time.\n\nOn the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy\nstorm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was\nremarkable for its storms.\n\nThe two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye,\nwhich was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by\ncattle and horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostov,\nwith a young officer named Ilyin, his protege, was sitting in a\nhastily constructed shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long\nmustaches extending onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had\nbeen overtaken by the rain, entered Rostov\'s shelter.\n\n\"I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raevski\'s\nexploit?\"\n\nAnd the officer gave them details of the Saltanov battle, which he\nhad heard at the staff.\n\nRostov, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water\ntrickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional\nglance at Ilyin, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of\nsixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same\nrelation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years\nbefore. Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything and adored him\nas a girl might have done.\n\nZdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke\ngrandiloquently of the Saltanov dam being \"a Russian Thermopylae,\" and\nof how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General\nRaevski. He recounted how Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam\nunder terrific fire and had charged with them beside him. Rostov heard\nthe story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski\'s\nenthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man ashamed of what\nhe was hearing, though with no intention of contradicting it. Since\nthe campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that\nmen always lie when describing military exploits, as he himself had\ndone when recounting them; besides that, he had experience enough to\nknow that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate\nit. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski\'s tale, nor did he like\nZdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his\ncheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and\ncrowded Rostov in the narrow shanty. Rostov looked at him in\nsilence. \"In the first place, there must have been such a confusion\nand crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did\nlead his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on\nsome dozen men nearest to him,\" thought he, \"the rest could not have\nseen how or with whom Raevski came onto the dam. And even those who\ndid see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had\nthey to do with Raevski\'s tender paternal feelings when their own\nskins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did\nnot depend on whether they took the Saltanov dam or not, as we are\ntold was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a\nsacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would\nnot have taken my brother Petya there, or even Ilyin, who\'s a stranger\nto me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under\ncover,\" Nicholas continued to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But\nhe did not express his thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had\ngained experience. He knew that this tale redounded to the glory of\nour arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted\naccordingly.\n\n\"I can\'t stand this any more,\" said Ilyin, noticing that Rostov\ndid not relish Zdrzhinski\'s conversation. \"My stockings and shirt...\nand the water is running on my seat! I\'ll go and look for shelter. The\nrain seems less heavy.\"\n\nIlyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.\n\nFive minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, came running\nback to the shanty.\n\n\"Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I\'ve found it! About two hundred\nyards away there\'s a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can\nat least get dry there, and Mary Hendrikhovna\'s there.\"\n\nMary Hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty\nyoung German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether\nfrom lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young\nwife in the early days of their marriage, took her about with him\nwherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a\nstanding joke among the hussar officers.\n\nRostov threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrushka to\nfollow with the things, and--now slipping in the mud, now splashing\nright through it--set off with Ilyin in the lessening rain and the\ndarkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.\n\n\"Rostov, where are you?\"\n\n\"Here. What lightning!\" they called to one another.');

Mary Hendrikhovna, a plump little\nblonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a\nbroad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep\nbehind her. Rostov and Ilyin, on entering the room, were welcomed with\nmerry shouts and laughter.\n\n\"Dear me, how jolly we are!\" said Rostov laughing.\n\n\"And why do you stand there gaping?\"\n\n\"What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don\'t\nmake our drawing room so wet.\"\n\n\"Don\'t mess Mary Hendrikhovna\'s dress!\" cried other voices.\n\nRostov and Ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change\ninto dry clothes without offending Mary Hendrikhovna\'s modesty. They\nwere going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but\nfound it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards\nby the light of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these\nofficers would on no account yield their position. Mary Hendrikhovna\nobliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and\nbehind that screen Rostov and Ilyin, helped by Lavrushka who had\nbrought their kits, changed their wet things for dry ones.\n\nA fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was\nfound, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small\nsamovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and\nhaving asked Mary Hendrikhovna to preside, they all crowded round her.\nOne offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands,\nanother spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the\ndamp, another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft, and\nyet another waved the flies off her husband\'s face, lest he should\nwake up.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" said Mary Hendrikhovna, smiling timidly and\nhappily. \"He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna,\" replied the officer, \"one must look\nafter the doctor. Perhaps he\'ll take pity on me someday, when it comes\nto cutting off a leg or an arm for me.\"\n\nThere were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one\ncould not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar\nheld only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter\nto take turns in order of seniority to receive one\'s tumbler from Mary\nHendrikhovna\'s plump little hands with their short and not overclean\nnails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love\nwith her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition\nsoon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the\ngeneral mood of courting Mary Hendrikhovna. She, seeing herself\nsurrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with\nsatisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she\nevidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.\n\nThere was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything\nelse, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary\nHendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostov\nreceived his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary\nHendrikhovna to stir it.\n\n\"But you take it without sugar?\" she said, smiling all the time,\nas if everything she said and everything the others said was very\namusing and had a double meaning.\n\n\"It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should\nstir my tea.\"\n\nMary Hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which\nsomeone meanwhile had pounced on.\n\n\"Use your finger, Mary Hendrikhovna, it will be still nicer,\" said\nRostov.\n\n\"Too hot!\" she replied, blushing with pleasure.\n\nIlyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it\nto Mary Hendrikhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.\n\n\"This is my cup,\" said he. \"Only dip your finger in it and I\'ll\ndrink it all up.\"\n\nWhen they had emptied the samovar, Rostov took a pack of cards and\nproposed that they should play \"Kings\" with Mary Hendrikhovna. They\ndrew lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostov\'s suggestion\nit was agreed that whoever became \"King\" should have the right to kiss\nMary Hendrikhovna\'s hand, and that the \"Booby\" should go to refill and\nreheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.\n\n\"Well, but supposing Mary Hendrikhovna is \'King\'?\" asked Ilyin.\n\n\"As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!\"\n\nThey had hardly begun to play before the doctor\'s disheveled head\nsuddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna. He had been awake for\nsome time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found\nnothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad\nand depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and\nasked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon\nas he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter\nand Mary Hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and\nthereby became still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard,\nthe doctor told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and\nlooked at him in alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had\nceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart, or\neverything in it would be stolen.\n\n\"But I\'ll send an orderly.... Two of them!\" said Rostov. \"What an\nidea, doctor!\"\n\n\"I\'ll stand guard on it myself!\" said Ilyin.\n\n\"No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for\ntwo nights,\" replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his\nwife, waiting for the game to end.\n\nSeeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers\ngrew still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from\nlaughter, for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When\nhe had gone, taking his wife with him, and had settled down with her\nin their covered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, covering\nthemselves with their wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long\ntime; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the doctor\'s uneasiness\nand his wife\'s delight, now they ran out into the porch and reported\nwhat was taking place in the covered trap. Several times Rostov,\ncovering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would\narouse him and conversation would be resumed, to the accompaniment\nof unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.');

Still laughing and talking, the officers began\nhurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water\nin the samovar. But Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting\nfor tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were\ndispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in clothes that were\nstill moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn,\nRostov and Ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather\nhood of the doctor\'s cart, from under the apron of which his feet were\nsticking out, and in the middle of which his wife\'s nightcap was\nvisible and her sleepy breathing audible.\n\n\"She really is a dear little thing,\" said Rostov to Ilyin, who was\nfollowing him.\n\n\"A charming woman!\" said Ilyin, with all the gravity of a boy of\nsixteen.\n\nHalf an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The\ncommand was heard to \"mount\" and the soldiers crossed themselves and\nmounted. Rostov riding in front gave the order \"Forward!\" and the\nhussars, with clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses\' hoofs\nsplashing in the mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad\nroad planted with birch trees on each side, following the infantry and\na battery that had gone on in front.\n\nTattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding\nbefore the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly\ngrass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly\nvisible, still wet with the night\'s rain; the drooping branches of the\nbirches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of\nwater to one side. The soldiers\' faces were more and more clearly\nvisible. Rostov, always closely followed by Ilyin, rode along the side\nof the road between two rows of birch trees.\n\nWhen campaigning, Rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding\nnot a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a\nsportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome,\nDonets horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he\nrode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a\npleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the\ndoctor\'s wife, but not once of the impending danger.\n\nFormerly, when going into action, Rostov had felt afraid; now he had\nnot the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had\ngrown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but\nbecause he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He\nhad grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything\nbut what would seem most likely to interest him--the impending danger.\nDuring the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as\nhe reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this,\nbut with time it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyin under\nthe birch trees, occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met\nhis hand, sometimes touching his horse\'s side with his foot, or,\nwithout turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar\nriding behind him, with as calm and careless an air as though he\nwere merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited face\nof Ilyin, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from\nexperience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet\nwas suffering and knew that only time could help him.\n\nAs soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the\nclouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the\nsummer morning after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but\nvertically now, and all was still. The whole sun appeared on the\nhorizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it.\nA few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top\nof the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew bright and\nglittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, came the\nsound of guns ahead of them.\n\nBefore Rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of\nthat firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy\'s adjutant came galloping from\nVitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.\n\nThe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery--which\nhad also quickened their pace--rode down a hill, and passing through\nan empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to\nlather and the men to flush.\n\n\"Halt! Dress your ranks!\" the order of the regimental commander\nwas heard ahead. \"Forward by the left. Walk, march!\" came the order\nfrom in front.\n\nAnd the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left\nflank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the\nfront line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they\nwere the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns\nwere visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated\nby slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be\nseen the enemy\'s columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in\naction, could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in\nthe dale.\n\nAt these sounds, long unheard, Rostov\'s spirits rose, as at the\nstrains of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots,\nnow together, now several quickly one after another. Again all was\nsilent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on\ndetonators and exploding them.\n\nThe hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A\ncannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the\nsquadron, halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode\nup the hill to the guns.\n\nAfter Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.\n\n\"Form column! Prepare to charge!\"\n\nThe infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the\ncavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears\nfluttering, and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was\nseen below to the left.\n\nAs soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered\nup the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by\nthe Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but\nfell spent without taking effect.\n\nThe sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more\npleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostov than the previous sounds\nof firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening\nout before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the\nmovement of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French\ndragoons, something confused happened there amid the smoke, and five\nminutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they\nhad occupied but more to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans\non chestnut horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French\ndragoons on gray horses could be seen.');

Nearer and\nnearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons\npursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small\nat the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving\ntheir arms and their sabers in the air.\n\nRostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He\nfelt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons\nnow, the latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be\nmade it must be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too\nlate. He looked around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing\nlike himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.\n\n\"Andrew Sevastyanych!\" said Rostov. \"You know, we could crush\nthem....\"\n\n\"A fine thing too!\" replied the captain, \"and really...\"\n\nRostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped\nto the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish\ngiving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling,\nwas following him. Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it.\nHe acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He\nsaw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder; he\nknew they could not withstand an attack--knew there was only that\nmoment and that if he let it slip it would not return. The bullets\nwere whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse\nwas so eager to go that he could not restrain himself. He touched\nhis horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind\nhim the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full\ntrot downhill toward the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the\nbottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a\ngallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans\nand the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now\nclose at hand. On seeing the hussars, the foremost began to turn,\nwhile those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which\nhe had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostov gave rein to his\nDonets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons\'\ndisordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung\nhimself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless\nhorse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were\ngalloping back. Rostov, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed\nafter him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared\nit, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that\nhe would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That\nFrenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching\non his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another moment\nRostov\'s horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the\nofficer\'s horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant\nRostov, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman\nwith it.\n\nThe instant he had done this, all Rostov\'s animation vanished. The\nofficer fell, not so much from the blow--which had but slightly cut\nhis arm above the elbow--as from the shock to his horse and from\nfright. Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see\nwhom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with\none foot on the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His\neyes, screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another\nblow, gazed up at Rostov with shrinking terror. His pale and\nmud-stained face--fair and young, with a dimple in the chin and\nlight-blue eyes--was not an enemy\'s face at all suited to a\nbattlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostov had\ndecided what to do with him, the officer cried, \"I surrender!\" He\nhurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and\ndid not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostov\'s face. Some\nhussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the\nsaddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was\nwounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his\nhorse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round\nhim; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In\nfront, the French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars\ngalloped hastily back with their prisoners. Rostov galloped back\nwith the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his\nheart. Something vague and confused, which he could not at all account\nfor, had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow\nhe had dealt him.\n\nCount Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, sent for\nRostov, thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to\nthe Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George\'s Cross. When\nsent for by Count Ostermann, Rostov, remembering that he had charged\nwithout orders, felt sure his commander was sending for him to\npunish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann\'s flattering words\nand promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the\nmore pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable\nfeeling of moral nausea. \"But what on earth is worrying me?\" he\nasked himself as he rode back from the general. \"Ilyin? No, he\'s safe.\nHave I disgraced myself in any way? No, that\'s not it.\" Something\nelse, resembling remorse, tormented him. \"Yes, oh yes, that French\nofficer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I\nraised it.\"\n\nRostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to\nhave a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was\nsitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked\nanxiously about him; The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called\na wound. He glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and waved his\nhand in greeting. Rostov still had the same indefinite feeling, as\nof shame.\n\nAll that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that\nRostov, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and\npreoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept\nturning something over in his mind.\n\nRostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which\nto his amazement had gained him the St. George\'s Cross and even given\nhim a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at\nall understand. \"So others are even more afraid than I am!\" he\nthought. \"So that\'s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I\ndo it for my country\'s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple\nand blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should\nkill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given\nme a St. George\'s Cross.... I can\'t make it out at all.\"\n\nBut while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could\nreach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune\nin the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the\naffair at Ostrovna he was brought into notice, received command of\nan hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was\nchosen.');

She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider\nin how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat\nor sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them\nfeel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to\nhelp her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked\nmuch in French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and\nprescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known\nto them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they\ncould not know the disease Natasha was suffering from, as no disease\nsuffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his\nown peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel,\ncomplicated disease, unknown to medicine--not a disease of the\nlungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical\nbooks, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations\nof the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur\nto the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to\nwork his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure,\nand they received money for it and had spent the best years of their\nlives on that business. But, above all, that thought was kept out of\ntheir minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful, as in\nfact they were to the whole Rostov family. Their usefulness did not\ndepend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part\nharmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they were given in\nsmall doses), but they were useful, necessary, and indispensable\nbecause they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who\nloved her--and that is why there are, and always will be,\npseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They\nsatisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy,\nand that something should be done, which is felt by those who are\nsuffering. They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in\na child, when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A\nchild knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or\nnurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better\nwhen this is done. The child cannot believe that the strongest and\nwisest of its people have no remedy for its pain, and the hope of\nrelief and the expression of its mother\'s sympathy while she rubs\nthe bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to Natasha because\nthey kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon\npass if only the coachman went to the chemist\'s in the Arbat and got a\npowder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks,\nand if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of\nprecisely two hours, neither more nor less.\n\nWhat would Sonya and the count and countess have done, how would\nthey have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been\nthose pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken\ncutlets, and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors, the\ncarrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the\nfamily circle? How would the count have borne his dearly loved\ndaughter\'s illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand\nrubles, and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her, or\nhad he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet\nother thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there, and\nhad he not been able to explain the details of how Metivier and Feller\nhad not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and Mudrov had\ndiagnosed them even better? What would the countess have done had\nshe not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly\nobeying the doctor\'s orders?\n\n\"You\'ll never get well like that,\" she would say, forgetting her\ngrief in her vexation, \"if you won\'t obey the doctor and take your\nmedicine at the right time! You mustn\'t trifle with it, you know, or\nit may turn to pneumonia,\" she would go on, deriving much comfort from\nthe utterance of that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well\nas to herself.\n\nWhat would Sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she\nhad not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be\nready to carry out all the doctor\'s injunctions with precision, and\nthat she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time\nwhen the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be\nadministered? Even to Natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so\nmany sacrifices were being made for her sake, and to know that she had\nto take medicine at certain hours, though she declared that no\nmedicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was\neven pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that she\ndid not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life.\n\nThe doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and\nregardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he\nhad gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed\nhim, he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said\nthat though there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this\nlast medicine and one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly\nmental, but... And the countess, trying to conceal the action from\nherself and from him, slipped a gold coin into his hand and always\nreturned to the patient with a more tranquil mind.\n\nThe symptoms of Natasha\'s illness were that she ate little, slept\nlittle, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that\nshe could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in\nthe stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostovs did not move to\nthe country that summer of 1812.\n\nIn spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders\nout of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was\nfond of such things made a large collection, and in spite of being\ndeprived of the country life to which she was accustomed, youth\nprevailed. Natasha\'s grief began to be overlaid by the impressions\nof daily life, it ceased to press so painfully on her heart, it\ngradually faded into the past, and she began to recover physically.');

She not merely avoided all external\nforms of pleasure--balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters--but she\nnever laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not\nsing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself,\ntears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those\npure times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should\nso uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so\nhappy. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a\nblasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint,\nno wish to coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that\ntime that no man was more to her than Nastasya Ivanovna, the buffoon.\nSomething stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy.\nBesides, she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish\nlife that had been so full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting,\n\"Uncle,\" and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otradnoe\nwere what she recalled oftenest and most painfully. What would she not\nhave given to bring back even a single day of that time! But it was\ngone forever. Her presentiment at the time had not deceived her--that\nthat state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return\nagain. Yet it was necessary to live on.\n\nIt comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had\nformerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the\nworld. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself,\n\"What next?\" But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in\nlife, yet life was passing. Natasha apparently tried not to be a\nburden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She\nkept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her\nbrother Petya. She liked to be with him better than with the others,\nand when alone with him she sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left\nthe house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one\nperson, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her with more\ndelicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously than did\nCount Bezukhov. Natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so\nfound great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful\nto him for it; nothing good on Pierre\'s part seemed to her to be an\neffort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there\nwas no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha noticed\nembarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,\nespecially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared\nthat something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her.\nShe noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and\nshyness, which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was\nto her. After those involuntary words--that if he were free he would\nhave asked on his knees for her hand and her love--uttered at a moment\nwhen she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natasha of\nhis feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had\nthen so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words\nare spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because Pierre was\na married man, but because Natasha felt very strongly with him that\nmoral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kuragin\nthat it never entered her head that the relations between him and\nherself could lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even\nto the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a\nman and a woman of which she had known several instances.\n\nBefore the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agrafena Ivanovna Belova, a\ncountry neighbor of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions\nat the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natasha should\nfast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha gladly welcomed the\nidea. Despite the doctor\'s orders that she should not go out early\nin the morning, Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the\nsacrament, not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov\nfamily by attending three services in their own house, but as Agrafena\nIvanovna did, by going to church every day for a week and not once\nmissing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.\n\nThe countess was pleased with Natasha\'s zeal; after the poor results\nof the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that\nprayer might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not\nwithout fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to\nNatasha\'s wish and entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena Ivanovna used\nto come to wake Natasha at three in the morning, but generally found\nher already awake. She was afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily\nwashing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old\nmantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh air, went out into the\ndeserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By Agrafena\nIvanovna\'s advice Natasha prepared herself not in their own parish,\nbut at a church where, according to the devout Agrafena Ivanovna,\nthe priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never\nmany people in the church; Natasha always stood beside Belova in the\ncustomary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the\nscreen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her,\nof humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her\nwhen at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the\nVirgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning\nlight falling from the window, she listened to the words of the\nservice which she tried to follow with understanding. When she\nunderstood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the\nprayers with shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was\nsweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is\npride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is only\nnecessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt\nguiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and\nwhen she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply\nasked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy upon\nher. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were\nthose of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met\nno one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and\neverybody within the houses was still asleep, Natasha experienced a\nfeeling new to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her\nfaults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of happiness.\n\nDuring the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every\nday. And the happiness of taking communion, or \"communing\" as Agrafena\nIvanovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natasha\nso great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.\n\nBut the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when,\ndressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the\nfirst time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the\nthought of the life that lay before her.\n\nThe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue\nthe powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.\n\n\"She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,\" said he,\nevidently sincerely satisfied with his success. \"Only, please be\nparticular about it.\n\n\"Be quite easy,\" he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the\ngold coin in his palm. \"She will soon be singing and frolicking about.\nThe last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has\nfreshened up very much.\"\n\nThe countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at\nher nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing\nroom.');

And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had\nbeen received, exaggerated reports became current about them and about\nthe position of Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the\narmy because it was in danger, it was said that Smolensk had\nsurrendered, that Napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle\ncould save Russia.\n\nOn the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was\nreceived but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the\nRostovs\', promised to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a\ncopy of the manifesto and appeal, which he would obtain from Count\nRostopchin.\n\nThat Sunday, the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskis\' private\nchapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o\'clock, when\nthe Rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air,\nthe shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the\ncrowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of\nthe band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the\nrattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot\nsunshine were all full of that summer languor, that content and\ndiscontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a\nbright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rostovs\'\nacquaintances, were at the Razumovskis\' chapel, for, as if expecting\nsomething to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for\ntheir country estates had not gone away that summer. As Natasha, at\nher mother\'s side, passed through the crowd behind a liveried\nfootman who cleared the way for them, she heard a young man speaking\nabout her in too loud a whisper.\n\n\"That\'s Rostova, the one who...\"\n\n\"She\'s much thinner, but all the same she\'s pretty!\"\n\nShe heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kuragin and Bolkonski.\nBut she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that\neveryone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to\nher. With a sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she\nfound herself in a crowd, Natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with\nblack lace walked--as women can walk--with the more repose and\nstateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for\ncertain that she was pretty, but this no longer gave her\nsatisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it tormented her more than\nanything else of late, and particularly so on this bright, hot\nsummer day in town. \"It\'s Sunday again--another week past,\" she\nthought, recalling that she had been here the Sunday before, \"and\nalways the same life that is no life, and the same surroundings in\nwhich it used to be so easy to live. I\'m pretty, I\'m young, and I know\nthat now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I know I am good,\" she\nthought, \"but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to\nanyone.\" She stood by her mother\'s side and exchanged nods with\nacquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies\'\ndresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not\ncrossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she\nthought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was\njudging others, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt\nhorrified at her own vileness, horrified that the former purity of her\nsoul was again lost to her.\n\nA comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that\nmild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the\nsouls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were\nclosed, the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft\nmysterious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which\nshe herself did not understand, made Natasha\'s breast heave, and a\njoyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.\n\n\"Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good\nforever, forever!\" she pleaded.\n\nThe deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen\nand, holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his\ndalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a\nloud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer...\n\n\"In peace let us pray unto the Lord.\"\n\n\"As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity,\nunited by brotherly love--let us pray!\" thought Natasha.\n\n\"For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our\nsouls.\"\n\n\"For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,\"\nprayed Natasha.\n\nWhen they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and\nDenisov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she\nremembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her\nall the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love\nus, she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and\nmother and Sonya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had\nacted toward them, and feeling all the strength of her love for\nthem. When they prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of\nher enemies and people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She\nincluded among her enemies the creditors and all who had business\ndealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies and\nthose who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much\nharm--and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as\nfor an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and\ncalmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were\nas nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed\nfor the Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the\nsign of the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not\nunderstand, still she could not doubt, and at any rate loved the\ngoverning Synod and prayed for it.\n\nWhen he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over\nhis breast and said, \"Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to\nChrist the Lord!\"\n\n\"Commit ourselves to God,\" Natasha inwardly repeated. \"Lord God, I\nsubmit myself to Thy will!\" she thought. \"I want nothing, wish for\nnothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take\nme!\" prayed Natasha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing\nherself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some\ninvisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from\nherself, from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.\n\nThe countess looked round several times at her daughter\'s softened\nface and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.\n\nUnexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual\norder Natasha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool,\nthe one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it\nbefore the doors of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his\npurple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down\nwith an effort. Everybody followed his example and they looked at\none another in surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the\nSynod--a prayer for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.\n\n\"Lord God of might, God of our salvation!\" began the priest in\nthat voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the\nSlav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.\n\n\"Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and\nblessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and\nhave mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay\nwaste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are\ngathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear\nJerusalem, Thy beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow\nThine altars, and to desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how\nlong shall the wicked triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful\npower?\n\n\"Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might\nour most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pavlovich;\nbe mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to\nhis righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless\nhis counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom\nby Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as\nThou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and\nDavid over Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands\nof those who have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins\nwith strength for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to\nhelp us; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against\nus, may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust\nbefore the wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them\nto flight; may they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the\nplots they have laid in secret be turned against them; let them fall\nbefore Thy servants\' feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art\nable to save both great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot\nprevail against Thee!\n\n\"God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and\nloving-kindness which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us,\nbut be gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy\nmany mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities! Create in\nus a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us, strengthen us all\nin Thy faith, fortify our hope, inspire us with true love one for\nanother, arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the\nheritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers, and let not the scepter\nof the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast\nsanctified.\n\n\"O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust,\nlet us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token\nof Thy blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see\nit and be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that\nThou art the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this\nday, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy\nservants to rejoice in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy\nthem swiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art\nthe defense, the succor, and the victory of them that put their\ntrust in Thee, and to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and Holy\nGhost, now and forever, world without end. Amen.\"\n\nIn Natasha\'s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her\nstrongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over\nAmalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about\nthe destruction of \"Thy Jerusalem,\" and she prayed to God with the\ntenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but\nwithout fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer.\nShe shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of\nrighteousness, for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope,\nand its animation by love. But she could not pray that her enemies\nmight be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had\nbeen wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them. But\nneither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being\nread on bended knees. She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe\nat the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins,\nand especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God to forgive\nthem all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace and\nhappiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.');

That terrible question\n\"Why?\" \"Wherefore?\" which had come to him amid every occupation, was\nnow replaced, not by another question or by a reply to the former\nquestion, but by her image. When he listened to, or himself took\npart in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human\nbaseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask\nhimself why men struggled so about these things when all is so\ntransient and incomprehensible--but he remembered her as he had last\nseen her, and all his doubts vanished--not because she had answered\nthe questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of\nher transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of\nspiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty--a\nrealm of beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever\nworldly baseness presented itself to him, he said to himself:\n\n\"Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar, and the\ncountry and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter?\nShe smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her,\nand no one will ever know it.\" And his soul felt calm and peaceful.\n\nPierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same\nidle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the\nRostovs\' there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the\nhabits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that\nbore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more\ndisquieting reports came from the seat of war and Natasha\'s health\nbegan to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling\nof careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not\nexplain, took possession of him. He felt that the condition he was\nin could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which\nwould change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere\nfor signs of that approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons\nhad revealed to Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon,\ndrawn from the Revelation of St. John.\n\nIn chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:\n\n\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number\nof the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six\nhundred threescore and six.\n\nAnd in the fifth verse of the same chapter:\n\n\nAnd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and\nblasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two\nmonths.\n\n\nThe French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as\nthe Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the\nothers tens, will have the following significance:\n\n      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k\n      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10\n       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s\n      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90\n             t    u    v    w    x    y\n            100  110  120  130  140  150\n                        z\n                       160\n\n\nWriting the words L\'Empereur Napoleon in numbers, it appears that the\nsum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold\nin the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words\nquarante-deux,* which was the term allowed to the beast that \"spoke\ngreat things and blasphemies,\" the same number 666 was obtained; from\nwhich it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon\'s power had come\nin the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy\npleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an\nend to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the\nsame system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an\nanswer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words\nL\'Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but\nthe sums were either more or less than 666. Once when making such\ncalculations he wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre\nBesouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he\nchanged the spelling, substituting a z for the s and adding de and the\narticle le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then it\noccurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in his\nname, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wrote\nLe russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five\ntoo much, and five was represented by e, the very letter elided from\nthe article le before the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though\nincorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L\'russe Besuhof made\n666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was\nconnected with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not\nknow, but he did not doubt that connection for a moment. His love for\nNatasha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the comet, 666,\nL\'Empereur Napoleon, and L\'russe Besuhof--all this had to mature and\nculminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow\nhabits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great\nachievement and great happiness.\n\n\n*Forty-two.\n\n\nOn the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre\nhad promised the Rostovs to bring them, from Count Rostopchin whom\nhe knew well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the\narmy. In the morning, when he went to call at Rostopchin\'s he met\nthere a courier fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who\noften danced at Moscow balls.\n\n\"Do, please, for heaven\'s sake, relieve me of something!\" said the\ncourier. \"I have a sackful of letters to parents.\"\n\nAmong these letters was one from Nicholas Rostov to his father.\nPierre took that letter, and Rostopchin also gave him the Emperor\'s\nappeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders,\nand his own most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders,\nPierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and\nrewarded, the name of Nicholas Rostov, awarded a St. George\'s Cross of\nthe Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostrovna affair, and in\nthe same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkonski, appointed to the\ncommand of a regiment of Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind\nthe Rostovs of Bolkonski, Pierre could not refrain from making them\nhappy by the news of their son\'s having received a decoration, so he\nsent that printed army order and Nicholas\' letter to the Rostovs,\nkeeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other orders to take with\nhim when he went to dinner.\n\nHis conversation with Count Rostopchin and the latter\'s tone of\nanxious hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how\nbadly things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of\nspies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that\nNapoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn,\nand the talk of the Emperor\'s being expected to arrive next day--all\naroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation\nin Pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance\nof the comet, and especially since the beginning of the war.\n\nHe had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done\nso had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society\nof Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached\nperpetual peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact\nthat when he saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform\nand were talking patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step.\nBut the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the\narmy lay in the vague idea that he was L\'russe Besuhof who had the\nnumber of the beast, 666; that his part in the great affair of setting\na limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous\nthings had been predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought\nnot to undertake anything, but wait for what was bound to come to\npass.');

His coachman\ndid not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his\nmaster was at the Rostovs\' he stayed till midnight. The Rostovs\'\nfootman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take\nhis hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and\nstick in the anteroom.\n\nThe first person he saw in the house was Natasha. Even before he saw\nher, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing\nsolfa exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since\nher illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted\nhim. He opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had\nworn at church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to\nhim when he opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his\nbroad, surprised face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.\n\n\"I want to try to sing again,\" she said, adding as if by way of\nexcuse, \"it is, at least, something to do.\"\n\n\"That\'s capital!\"\n\n\"How glad I am you\'ve come! I am so happy today,\" she said, with the\nold animation Pierre had not seen in her for along time. \"You know\nNicholas has received a St. George\'s Cross? I am so proud of him.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don\'t want to interrupt\nyou,\" he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.\n\nNatasha stopped him.\n\n\"Count, is it wrong of me to sing?\" she said blushing, and fixing\nher eyes inquiringly on him.\n\n\"No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?\"\n\n\"I don\'t know myself,\" Natasha answered quickly, \"but I should not\nlike to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely.\nYou don\'t know how important you are to me, how much you\'ve done for\nme....\" She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her\nwords. \"I saw in that same army order that he, Bolkonski\" (she\nwhispered the name hastily), \"is in Russia, and in the army again.\nWhat do you think?\"--she was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid\nher strength might fail her--\"Will he ever forgive me? Will he not\nalways have a bitter feeling toward me? What do you think? What do you\nthink?\"\n\n\"I think...\" Pierre replied, \"that he has nothing to forgive....\nIf I were in his place...\"\n\nBy association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the\nday when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not\nhimself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his\nknees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love\ntook possession of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she\ndid not give him time to say them.\n\n\"Yes, you... you...\" she said, uttering the word you\nrapturously--\"that\'s a different thing. I know no one kinder, more\ngenerous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there\nthen, and now too, I don\'t know what would have become of me,\nbecause...\"\n\nTears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music\nbefore her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and\ndown the room.\n\nJust then Petya came running in from the drawing room.\n\nPetya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips\nand resembled Natasha. He was preparing to enter the university, but\nhe and his friend Obolenski had lately, in secret, agreed to join\nthe hussars.\n\nPetya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this\naffair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted\nin the hussars.\n\nPierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what\nPetya was saying.\n\nPetya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.\n\n\"Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirilych, for heaven\'s sake! You\nare my only hope,\" said Petya.\n\n\"Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I\'ll mention it, I\'ll bring\nit all up today.\"\n\n\"Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?\" asked the old count.\n\"The countess has been to Mass at the Razumovskis\' and heard the new\nprayer. She says it\'s very fine.\"\n\n\"Yes, I\'ve got it,\" said Pierre. \"The Emperor is to be here\ntomorrow... there\'s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility,\nand they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me\ncongratulate you!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?\"\n\n\"We are again retreating. They say we\'re already near Smolensk,\"\nreplied Pierre.\n\n\"O Lord, O Lord!\" exclaimed the count. \"Where is the manifesto?\"\n\n\"The Emperor\'s appeal? Oh yes!\"\n\nPierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not\nfind them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the\ncountess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently\nexpecting Natasha, who had left off singing but had not yet come\ninto the drawing room.\n\n\"On my word, I don\'t know what I\'ve done with it,\" he said.\n\n\"There he is, always losing everything!\" remarked the countess.\n\nNatasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face\nand sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered,\nPierre\'s features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and\nwhile still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.\n\n\"No, really! I\'ll drive home, I must have left them there. I\'ll\ncertainly...\"\n\n\"But you\'ll be late for dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh! And my coachman has gone.\"\n\nBut Sonya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom,\nhad found them in Pierre\'s hat, where he had carefully tucked them\nunder the lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.\n\n\"No, after dinner,\" said the old count, evidently expecting much\nenjoyment from that reading.\n\nAt dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new\nchevalier of St. George, Shinshin told them the town news, of the\nillness of the old Georgian princess, of Metivier\'s disappearance from\nMoscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchin\nand accused of being a French \"spyer\" (so Count Rostopchin had told\nthe story), and how Rostopchin let him go and assured the people\nthat he was \"not a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.\"\n\n\"People are being arrested...\" said the count. \"I\'ve told the\ncountess she should not speak French so much. It\'s not the time for it\nnow.\"\n\n\"And have you heard?\" Shinshin asked. \"Prince Golitsyn has engaged a\nmaster to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak\nFrench in the streets.\"\n\n\"And how about you, Count Peter Kirilych? If they call up the\nmilitia, you too will have to mount a horse,\" remarked the old\ncount, addressing Pierre.\n\nPierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming\nnot to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.\n\n\"Oh yes, the war,\" he said. \"No! What sort of warrior should I make?\nAnd yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can\'t make it out. I\ndon\'t know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these\ntimes no one can answer for himself.\"\n\nAfter dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy\nchair and with a serious face asked Sonya, who was considered an\nexcellent reader, to read the appeal.\n\n\n\"To Moscow, our ancient Capital!\n\n\"The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He\ncomes to despoil our beloved country.\"\n\n\nSonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count\nlistened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.\n\nNatasha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father\nand now at Pierre.\n\nPierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The\ncountess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn\nexpression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that\nthe danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshin,\nwith a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make\nfun of anything that gave him the opportunity: Sonya\'s reading, any\nremark of the count\'s, or even the manifesto itself should no better\npretext present itself.\n\nAfter reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes\nthe Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious\nnobility, Sonya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the\nattention that was being paid to her, read the last words:\n\n\n\"We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that\nCapital and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the\ndirection of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy\'s path\nand those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the\nruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may\nEurope delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia!\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that\'s it!\" cried the count, opening his moist eyes and\nsniffing repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his\nnose; and he added, \"Let the Emperor but say the word and we\'ll\nsacrifice everything and begrudge nothing.\"\n\nBefore Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on\nthe count\'s patriotism, Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to\nher father.\n\n\"What a darling our Papa is!\" she cried, kissing him, and she\nagain looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned\nto her with her better spirits.\n\n\"There! Here\'s a patriot for you!\" said Shinshin.\n\n\"Not a patriot at all, but simply...\" Natasha replied in an\ninjured tone. \"Everything seems funny to you, but this isn\'t at all\na joke....\"\n\n\"A joke indeed!\" put in the count. \"Let him but say the word and\nwe\'ll all go.... We\'re not Germans!\"\n\n\"But did you notice, it says, \'for consultation\'?\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Never mind what it\'s for....\"\n\nAt this moment, Petya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came\nup to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking\nvoice that was now deep and now shrill:\n\n\"Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it\'s as you\nplease, but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army,\nbecause I can\'t... that\'s all....\"\n\nThe countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and\nturned angrily to her husband.\n\n\"That comes of your talking!\" said she.\n\nBut the count had already recovered from his excitement.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said he. \"Here\'s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You\nmust study.\"\n\n\"It\'s not nonsense, Papa. Fedya Obolenski is younger than I, and\nhe\'s going too. Besides, all the same I can\'t study now when...\" Petya\nstopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,\n\"when our Fatherland is in danger.\"\n\n\"That\'ll do, that\'ll do--nonsense....\"\n\n\"But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.\"\n\n\"Petya! Be quiet, I tell you!\" cried the count, with a glance at his\nwife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.\n\n\"And I tell you--Peter Kirilych here will also tell you...\"\n\n\"Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother\'s milk has hardly dried on your\nlips and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,\"\nand the count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably\nto reread them in his study before having a nap.\n\n\"Well, Peter Kirilych, let\'s go and have a smoke,\" he said.\n\nPierre was agitated and undecided. Natasha\'s unwontedly brilliant\neyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had\nreduced him to this condition.\n\n\"No, I think I\'ll go home.\"\n\n\"Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don\'t\noften come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,\" said the count\ngood-naturedly, pointing to Natasha, \"only brightens up when you\'re\nhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...\"\nsaid Pierre hurriedly.\n\n\"Well, then, au revoir!\" said the count, and went out of the room.\n\n\"Why are you going? Why are you upset?\" asked Natasha, and she\nlooked challengingly into Pierre\'s eyes.\n\n\"Because I love you!\" was what he wanted to say, but he did not\nsay it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.\n\n\"Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No,\nsimply I have business....\"\n\n\"Why? No, tell me!\" Natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.\n\nThey looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces.

When he came in to tea,\nsilent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to\nnotice anything.\n\nNext day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostovs\'\ndomestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That\nmorning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar\nto look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,\ngesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word\nto anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to\navoid notice. Petya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and\nto explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor\nto be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostov,\nin spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be\nno hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing,\nPetya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the\ngentleman-in-waiting.\n\nIt was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted for\nsuccess in reaching the Emperor--he even thought how surprised\neveryone would be at his youthfulness--and yet in the arrangement of\nhis collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to\nappear a grown-up man. But the farther he went and the more his\nattention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the\nKremlin, the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and\ndeliberation of a man. As he approached the Kremlin he even began to\navoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a\nmenacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to\nthe wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic\nintentions with which he had come that in spite of all his\ndetermination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,\nrumbling beneath the archway. Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a\nfootman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing\nsome time in the gateway, Petya tried to move forward in front of\nthe others without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began\nresolutely working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in\nfront of him, who was the first against whom he directed his\nefforts, angrily shouted at him:\n\n\"What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don\'t you see we\'re all\nstanding still? Then why push?\"\n\n\"Anybody can shove,\" said the footman, and also began working his\nelbows to such effect that he pushed Petya into a very filthy corner\nof the gateway.\n\nPetya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the\ndamp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a\nman\'s.\n\nHe felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if\nhe were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he\nwould not be admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten\noneself up or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of\nthe generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostovs\', and\nPetya thought of asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that\nwould not be a manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed\nin, the crowd, carrying Petya with it, streamed forward into the\nKremlin Square which was already full of people. There were people not\nonly in the square, but everywhere--on the slopes and on the roofs. As\nsoon as Petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound\nof bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole\nKremlin.\n\nFor a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were\nbared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Petya was being\npressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted,\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\" Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and\npinched, but could see nothing except the people about him.\n\nAll the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm.\nA tradesman\'s wife standing beside Petya sobbed, and the tears ran\ndown her cheeks.\n\n\"Father! Angel! Dear one!\" she kept repeating, wiping away her tears\nwith her fingers.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" was heard on all sides.\n\nFor a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush\nforward.\n\nQuite beside himself, Petya, clinching his teeth and rolling his\neyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting\n\"hurrah!\" as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and\neveryone else, but on both sides of him other people with similarly\nferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted \"hurrah!\"\n\n\"So this is what the Emperor is!\" thought Petya. \"No, I can\'t\npetition him myself--that would be too bold.\" But in spite of this\nhe continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the\nbacks of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a\nstrip of red cloth spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed\nback--the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed\ntoo close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace\nto the Cathedral of the Assumption--and Petya unexpectedly received\nsuch a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that\nsuddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost\nconsciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance\nwith a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a\nshabby blue cassock--probably a church clerk and chanter--was\nholding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure\nof the crowd with the other.\n\n\"You\'ve crushed the young gentleman!\" said the clerk. \"What are\nyou up to? Gently!... They\'ve crushed him, crushed him!\"\n\nThe Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd\nspread out again more evenly, and the clerk led Petya--pale and\nbreathless--to the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Petya,\nand suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those\nwho stood nearest him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him\non the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached those others\n(whoever they might be) who had crushed him.\n\n\"One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it?\nKilling people! Poor dear, he\'s as white as a sheet!\"--various\nvoices were heard saying.\n\nPetya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain\nhad passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had\nobtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the\nEmperor who would be returning that way. Petya no longer thought of\npresenting his petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would\nbe happy!\n\nWhile the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the\nAssumption--it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the\nEmperor\'s arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with\nthe Turks--the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling\nkvas, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Petya was\nparticularly fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A\ntradesman\'s wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much\nthe shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got\ndear. The clerk who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary\nabout the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop. The\nclerk several times used the word \"plenary\" (of the service), a word\nPetya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking with some\nserf girls who were cracking nuts. All these conversations, especially\nthe joking with the girls, were such as might have had a particular\ncharm for Petya at his age, but they did not interest him now. He sat\non his elevation--the pedestal of the cannon--still agitated as before\nby the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him. The feeling of\npain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed, together\nwith that of rapture, still further intensified his sense of the\nimportance of the occasion.\n\nSuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the\nembankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and\nthe crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the\nfiring. Petya too would have run there, but the clerk who had taken\nthe young gentleman under his protection stopped him. The firing was\nstill proceeding when officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting\ncame running out of the cathedral, and after them others in a more\nleisurely manner: caps were again raised, and those who had run to\nlook at the cannon ran back again. At last four men in uniforms and\nsashes emerged from the cathedral doors. \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted the\ncrowd again.\n\n\"Which is he? Which?\" asked Petya in a tearful voice, of those around\nhim, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Petya,\nfixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the\ntears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm on\nhim--though it happened not to be the Emperor--frantically shouted\n\"Hurrah!\" and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join\nthe army.\n\nThe crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and\nbegan to disperse. It was already late, and Petya had not eaten\nanything and was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home\nbut stood with that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd\nbefore the palace while the Emperor dined--looking in at the palace\nwindows, expecting he knew not what, and envying alike the notables he\nsaw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court\nfootmen who served at table, glimpses of whom could be seen through\nthe windows.\n\nWhile the Emperor was dining, Valuev, looking out of the window,\nsaid:\n\n\"The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.\"\n\nThe dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit,\nrose and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Petya among them,\nrushed toward the balcony.\n\n\"Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...\" cried the crowd, and Petya\nwith it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Petya among them,\nwept with joy.\n\nA largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand\nbroke off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A\ncoachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched\nit up. Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this\nthe Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began\nthrowing them down from the balcony. Petya\'s eyes grew bloodshot,\nand still more excited by the danger of being crushed, he rushed at\nthe biscuits. He did not know why, but he had to have a biscuit from\nthe Tsar\'s hand and he felt that he must not give way. He sprang\nforward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit; the\nold woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on\nthe ground--she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach\nthem. Petya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a biscuit,\nand as if fearing to be too late, again shouted \"Hurrah!\" with a voice\nalready hoarse.\n\nThe Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd\nbegan to disperse.\n\n\"There! I said if only we waited--and so it was!\" was being joyfully\nsaid by various people.\n\nHappy as Petya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that\nall the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home\nfrom the Kremlin, but called on his friend Obolenski, who was\nfifteen and was also entering the regiment. On returning home Petya\nannounced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter\nthe service he would run away. And next day, Count Ilya Rostov--though\nhe had not yet quite yielded--went to inquire how he could arrange for\nPetya to serve where there would be least danger.');

In the first were the nobility and gentry\nin their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted\ncoats of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen\'s hall there\nwas an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat\non high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the\nEmperor, but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.\n\nAll these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in\ntheir own houses, were in uniform--some in that of Catherine\'s day,\nothers in that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of\nAlexander\'s time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the\ngeneral characteristic of being in uniform imparted something\nstrange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities,\nboth old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow,\nand bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially striking. For\nthe most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, or, if\nthey walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone\nyounger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Petya had\nseen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the general\nexpectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the everyday\ninterests in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zinaida Dmitrievna\'s\nhealth, and so on.\n\nPierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman\'s\nuniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated; this\nextraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the\nmerchant-class--les etats generaux (States-General)--evoked in him a\nwhole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply\ngraven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat social and the French\nRevolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor\'s\nappeal--that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation\nwith his people--strengthened this idea. And imagining that in this\ndirection something important which he had long awaited was drawing\nnear, he strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but\nnowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.\n\nThe Emperor\'s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all\nmoved about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of\nconversation, Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the\nnobility were to stand when the Emperor entered, when a ball should be\ngiven in the Emperor\'s honor, whether they should group themselves\nby districts or by whole provinces... and so on; but as soon as the\nwar was touched on, or what the nobility had been convened for, the\ntalk became undecided and indefinite. Then all preferred listening\nto speaking.\n\nA middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a\nretired naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small\ncrowd was pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had\nformed round the speaker and listened. Count Ilya Rostov, in a\nmilitary uniform of Catherine\'s time, was sauntering with a pleasant\nsmile among the crowd, with all of whom he was acquainted. He too\napproached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of\napproval, as he always did, to what the speaker was saying. The\nretired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was evident from the\nexpression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some\npeople Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away\ndisapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his\nway into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that\nthe man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from his\nown. The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical,\nand aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing his r\'s and\ngenerally slurring his consonants: the voice of a man calling out to\nhis servant, \"Heah! Bwing me my pipe!\" It was indicative of\ndissipation and the exercise of authority.\n\n\"What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the\nEmpewah? Ah we to take Smolensk as our patte\'n? If the noble\nawistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its\nloyalty to our sov\'weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we\nfo\'gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah \'seven? All that\ndid was to enwich the pwiests\' sons and thieves and wobbahs....\"\n\nCount Ilya Rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval.\n\n\"And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only\nwuined our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o\' ou\' men\nwill wetu\'n neithah soldiers no\' peasants, and we\'ll get only\ndepwavity fwom them. The nobility don\'t gwudge theah lives--evewy\none of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and the sov\'weign\" (that\nwas the way he referred to the Emperor) \"need only say the word and\nwe\'ll all die fo\' him!\" added the orator with animation.\n\nCount Rostov\'s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but\nPierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,\nbut not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had\nhe opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in\nhis head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the\nfirst speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing\ndebates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct\ntones:\n\n\"I imagine, sir,\" said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth,\n\"that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it\'s best\nfor the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to\ncall out the militia. We have been summoned to reply to the appeal\nwith which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what\nis best--conscription or the militia--we can leave to the supreme\nauthority....\"\n\nPierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his\nheart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow\nattitude into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped\nforward and interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would\nsay, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French\nor expressing himself in bookish Russian.\n\n\"Excuse me, your excellency,\" he began. (He was well acquainted with\nthe senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address\nhim formally.) \"Though I don\'t agree with the gentleman...\" (he\nhesitated: he wished to say, \"Mon tres honorable preopinant\"--\"My very\nhonorable opponent\") \"with the gentleman... whom I have not the\nhonor of knowing, I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not\nmerely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider\nthe means by which we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,\" he went\non, warming to his subject, \"that the Emperor himself would not be\nsatisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing\nto devote to his service, and chair a canon* we are ready to make of\nourselves--and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel.\"\n\n\n*\"Food for cannon.\"\n\n\nMany persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator\'s\nsarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre\'s remarks. Only Count Rostov\nwas pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval\nofficer, the senator, and in general with whatever speech he had\nlast heard.\n\n\"I think that before discussing these questions,\" Pierre\ncontinued, \"we should ask the Emperor--most respectfully ask His\nMajesty--to let us know the number of our troops and the position in\nwhich our army and our forces now are, and then...\"\n\nBut scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked\nfrom three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old\nacquaintance, a boston player who had always been well disposed toward\nhim, Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin. Adraksin was in uniform, and whether\nas a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw\nbefore him quite a different man. With a sudden expression of\nmalevolence on his aged face, Adraksin shouted at Pierre:\n\n\"In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the\nEmperor about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that\nright, the Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are\nmoved according to the enemy\'s movements and the number of men\nincreases and decreases...\"\n\nAnother voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty\nyears of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies\' and knew as\na bad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to\nPierre, interrupted Adraksin.\n\n\"Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,\" he continued, \"but for\nacting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy\nRussia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our\nwives and children.\" The nobleman smote his breast. \"We will all\narise, every one of us will go, for our father the Tsar!\" he\nshouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were\nheard in the crowd. \"We are Russians and will not grudge our blood\nin defense of our faith, the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease\nraving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe how\nRussia rises to the defense of Russia!\"\n\nPierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that\nhis words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible\nthan the sound of his opponent\'s voice.\n\nCount Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval;\nseveral persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end\nof a phrase, said:\n\n\"That\'s right, quite right! Just so!\"\n\nPierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his\nserfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in\norder to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many\nvoices shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostov had\nnot time to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased,\ndispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the\nlargest hall and to the big table. Not only was Pierre\'s attempt to\nspeak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and\npeople turned away from him as from a common enemy. This happened\nnot because they were displeased by the substance of his speech, which\nhad even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches, but to\nanimate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible\nobject to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other orators spoke\nafter the excited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke\neloquently and with originality.\n\nGlinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized\n(cries of \"author! author!\" were heard in the crowd), said that\n\"hell must be repulsed by hell,\" and that he had seen a child\nsmiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps, but \"we will not be\nthat child.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!\" was repeated approvingly in the back\nrows of the crowd.\n\nThe crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or\nbald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of\nwhom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or\nplaying boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd\nadvanced to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of\nthe chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two\ntogether. Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to\nsay and hastened to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked\ntheir brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it. The old\nmagnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned to look first at one and\nthen at another, and their faces for the most part only expressed\nthe fact that they found it very hot. Pierre, however, felt excited,\nand the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all\nlengths--which found expression in the tones and looks more than in\nthe substance of the speeches--infected him too. He did not renounce\nhis opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to\njustify himself.\n\n\"I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices\nwhen we know what is needed!\" said he, trying to be heard above the\nother voices.\n\nOne of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention\nwas immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the\ntable.\n\n\"Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!\"\nshouted one man.\n\n\"He is the enemy of mankind!\" cried another. \"Allow me to speak....\"\n\"Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...\"');

Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had\nconferred rose with apparent relief, and began walking up and down,\narm in arm, to stretch their legs and converse in couples.\n\n\"The Emperor! The Emperor!\" a sudden cry resounded through the halls\nand the whole throng hurried to the entrance.\n\nThe Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two\nlines of nobles.

From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor\nspoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he\nplaced on the Moscow nobility. He was answered by a voice which\ninformed him of the resolution just arrived at.\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" said the Emperor with a quivering voice.\n\nThere was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so\nthat Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor\nsaying with emotion:\n\n\"I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it\nhas surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the\nFatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious...\"\n\nThe Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and\nrapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.\n\n\"Yes, most precious... a royal word,\" said Count Rostov, with a sob.\nHe stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything,\nunderstood everything in his own way.\n\nFrom the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the\nmerchants. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those\nwho saw him come out from the merchants\' hall with tears of emotion in\nhis eyes. As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address\nthe merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in\na trembling voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out\naccompanied by two merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat\notkupshchik. The other was the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face\nand narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled the thin man\'s eyes,\nand the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept\nrepeating:\n\n\"Our lives and property--take them, Your Majesty!\"\n\nPierre\'s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was\nready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything.

Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the\nbest way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a\ngreat commander. Rostov charged the French because he could not\nrestrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same\nway the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord\nwith their personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and\naims. They were moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant,\nreasoned, imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it\nof their own free will, but they all were involuntary tools of\nhistory, carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible\nto us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and the higher\nthey stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.\n\nThe actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal\ninterests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of\nthat time but its historic results.\n\nProvidence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal\naims, to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of\nthem at all expected--neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still\nless any of those who did the actual fighting.\n\nThe cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear\nto us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand,\nits advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any\npreparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, the character\ngiven to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the\nfoe this aroused among the Russian people. But no one at the time\nforesaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army\nof eight hundred thousand men--the best in the world and led by the\nbest general--could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half\nits numerical strength, and led by inexperienced commanders as the\nRussian army was. Not only did no one see this, but on the Russian\nside every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save\nRussia, while on the French side, despite Napoleon\'s experience and\nso-called military genius, every effort was directed to pushing on\nto Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing\nthat was bound to lead to destruction.\n\nIn historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of\nsaying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he\nsought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk,\nand of making similar statements to show that the danger of the\ncampaign was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of\ntelling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war\nplan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this\nplan some of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman,\nothers to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself--pointing to\nnotes, projects, and letters which contain hints of such a line of\naction. But all these hints at what happened, both from the French\nside and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the\nevent. Had that event not occurred these hints would have been\nforgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints\nand expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now\nbeen forgotten because the event falsified them. There are always so\nmany conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end\nthere will always be people to say: \"I said then that it would be so,\"\nquite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to\nquite the contrary effect.\n\nConjectures as to Napoleon\'s awareness of the danger of extending\nhis line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the\ndepths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much\nstraining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and\nhis marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts\nare in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period\nof the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw\nthe French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry\ninto Russia everything was done to stop them. And not only was\nNapoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step\nforward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former\ncampaigns, but very lazily.\n\nAt the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our\nsole aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage\nif we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the\ncountry. Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every\ninch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp\nwas formed on Pfuel\'s plan, and there was no intention of retiring\nfarther. The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step\nthey retired. He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even\nreach Smolensk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow,\nand when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smolensk was\nabandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought\nunder its walls.\n\nSo thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were\nstill more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating\ninto the depths of the country.\n\nNapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country\nand missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he\nwas at Smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther, though\nas we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.\n\nThe facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of\nthe advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders\nthen think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring\nof Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any\nplan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most\ncomplex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who\ntook part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable,\nor of the one way of saving Russia. Everything came about\nfortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the\ncampaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving\nbattle and checking the enemy\'s advance, and by this effort to unite\nthem while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily\nwithdrawing the armies at an acute angle--we led the French on to\nSmolensk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the\nFrench advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more\nacute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an\nunpopular foreigner disliked by Bagration (who would come under his\ncommand), and Bagration--being in command of the second army--tried to\npostpone joining up and coming under Barclay\'s command as long as he\ncould. Bagration was slow in effecting the junction--though that was\nthe chief aim of all at headquarters--because, as he alleged, he\nexposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to\nretire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from\nflank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army;\nand it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the\ncommand of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior\nto his own.\n\nThe Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence\nand ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of\nadvisers and plans, destroyed the first army\'s energy and it retired.\n\nThe intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but\nPaulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed\nhis energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel\'s whole plan was\nabandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not\ninspire confidence his power was limited. The armies were divided,\nthere was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from\nthis confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign\ncommander in chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and\nthe avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from\nhad the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay,\nbeen in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation\nagainst the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.\n\nAt last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and\nindeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was\nnecessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the\nnation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor\nto Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled.\n\nHe left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief\'s\nundivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action\nwould then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more\nconfused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarevich, and a swarm of\nadjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in\nchief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling\nless free than ever under the observation of all these \"eyes of the\nEmperor,\" became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive\naction and avoided giving battle.\n\nBarclay stood for caution. The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and\ndemanded a general engagement. Lubomirski, Bronnitski, Wlocki, and the\nothers of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under\npretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish\nadjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with\nBennigsen and the Tsarevich.\n\nAt Smolensk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagration\ndisliked it.\n\nBagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.\nBarclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior\nofficer Bagration.\n\nDespite his seniority in rank Bagration, in this contest of\nmagnanimity, took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted,\nagreed with him less than ever. By the Emperor\'s orders Bagration\nreported direct to him. He wrote to Arakcheev, the Emperor\'s\nconfidant: \"It must be as my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with\nthe Minister (meaning Barclay). For God\'s sake send me somewhere\nelse if only in command of a regiment. I cannot stand it here.\nHeadquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist and\nthere is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving my\nsovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving\nBarclay. I confess I do not want to.\"\n\nThe swarm of Bronnitskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still\nfurther embittered the relations between the commanders in chief,\nand even less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the\nFrench before Smolensk. A general was sent to survey the position.\nThis general, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a\ncorps commander, and, having spent the day with him, returned to\nBarclay and condemned, as unsuitable from every point of view, the\nbattleground he had not seen.\n\nWhile disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of\nbattle, and while we were looking for the French--having lost touch\nwith them--the French stumbled upon Neverovski\'s division and\nreached the walls of Smolensk.\n\nIt was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk to save\nour lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were\nkilled on both sides.\n\nSmolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and\nof the whole people. But Smolensk was burned by its own\ninhabitants-who had been misled by their governor. And these ruined\ninhabitants, setting an example to other Russians, went to Moscow\nthinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe.\nNapoleon advanced farther and we retired, thus arriving at the very\nresult which caused his destruction.');

I\'m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well\nthen, gloat over it! Gloat over it!\"\n\nAfter that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He\nwas ill and did not leave his study.\n\nPrincess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the\nold prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit\nMademoiselle Bourienne either. Tikhon alone attended him.\n\nAt the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his\nformer way of life, devoting himself with special activity to building\noperations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely\nbreaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks\nand cold tone to his daughter seemed to say: \"There, you see? You\nplotted against me, you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations\nwith that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, but you see I need\nneither her nor you!\"\n\nPrincess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching\nhis lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to\nDessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her\nold nurse, or with \"God\'s folk\" who sometimes came by the back door to\nsee her.\n\nOf the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She\nfeared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at\nthe strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did\nnot understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her\nlike all previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this\nwar, though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was\npassionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own\nconception of it to her, and though the \"God\'s folk\" who came to see\nher reported, in their own way, the rumors current among the people of\nan invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie (now Princess\nDrubetskaya), who had resumed correspondence with her, wrote patriotic\nletters from Moscow.\n\n\"I write you in Russian, my good friend,\" wrote Julie in her\nFrenchified Russian, \"because I have a detestation for all the French,\nand the same for their language which I cannot support to hear\nspoken.... We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored\nEmperor.\n\n\"My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but\nthe news which I have inspires me yet more.\n\n\"You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski, embracing\nhis two sons and saying: \'I will perish with them but we will not be\nshaken!\' And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we\nwere unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The\nprincesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy\nwidows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie,\nonly you, my friend, are missing...\" and so on.\n\nThe chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance\nof this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not\nrecognize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.\nThe prince\'s tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary\nunhesitatingly believed him.\n\nAll that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even\nanimated. He planned another garden and began a new building for the\ndomestic serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about\nhim was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his\nstudy as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would\norder his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he\nremained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and\ndozed there without undressing, while--instead of Mademoiselle\nBourienne--a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night\nin the dining room.\n\nOn August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his\nfirst letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had\ndutifully asked his father\'s forgiveness for what he had allowed\nhimself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this\nletter the old prince had replied affectionately, and from that time\nhad kept the Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew\'s second letter,\nwritten near Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a\nbrief account of the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had\ndrawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war. In this\nletter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying\nat Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on the army\'s direct\nline of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.\n\nAt dinner that day, on Dessalles\' mentioning that the French were\nsaid to have already entered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered his\nson\'s letter.\n\n\"There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,\" he said to Princess\nMary--\"Haven\'t you read it?\"\n\n\"No, Father,\" she replied in a frightened voice.\n\nShe could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had\narrived.\n\n\"He writes about this war,\" said the prince, with the ironic smile\nthat had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.\n\n\"That must be very interesting,\" said Dessalles. \"Prince Andrew is\nin a position to know...\"\n\n\"Oh, very interesting!\" said Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\"Go and get it for me,\" said the old prince to Mademoiselle\nBourienne. \"You know--under the paperweight on the little table.\"\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.\n\n\"No, don\'t!\" he exclaimed with a frown. \"You go, Michael Ivanovich.\"\n\nMichael Ivanovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he\nhad left the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down\nhis napkin and went himself.\n\n\"They can\'t do anything... always make some muddle,\" he muttered.\n\nWhile he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle\nBourienne, and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The\nold prince returned with quick steps, accompanied by Michael\nIvanovich, bringing the letter and a plan. These he put down beside\nhim--not letting anyone read them at dinner.\n\nOn moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess\nMary and, spreading out before him the plan of the new building and\nfixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she\nhad done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was\nexamining the plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.\n\n\"What do you think of it, Prince?\" Dessalles ventured to ask.\n\n\"I? I?...\" said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not\ntaking his eyes from the plan of the building.\n\n\"Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...\"\n\n\"Ha ha ha! The theater of war!\" said the prince. \"I have said and\nstill say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never\nget beyond the Niemen.\"\n\nDessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of\nthe Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess\nMary, forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that\nwhat her father was saying was correct.\n\n\"When the snow melts they\'ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they\ncould fail to see it,\" the prince continued, evidently thinking of the\ncampaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. \"Bennigsen should have\nadvanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different\nturn...\"\n\n\"But, Prince,\" Dessalles began timidly, \"the letter mentions\nVitebsk....\"\n\n\"Ah, the letter? Yes...\" replied the prince peevishly. \"Yes...\nyes...\" His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused.\n\"Yes, he writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river\nis it?\"\n\nDessalles dropped his eyes.\n\n\"The prince says nothing about that,\" he remarked gently.\n\n\"Doesn\'t he? But I didn\'t invent it myself.\"\n\nNo one spoke for a long time.\n\n\"Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivanovich,\" he suddenly went on,\nraising his head and pointing to the plan of the building, \"tell me\nhow you mean to alter it....\"\n\nMichael Ivanovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking\nto him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and\nDessalles and went to his own room.\n\nPrincess Mary saw Dessalles\' embarrassed and astonished look fixed\non her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that\nher father had forgotten his son\'s letter on the drawing-room table;\nbut she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the\nreason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think\nabout it.\n\nIn the evening Michael Ivanovich, sent by the prince, came to\nPrincess Mary for Prince Andrew\'s letter which had been forgotten in\nthe drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to\nher to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing.\n\n\"Always busy,\" replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully\nironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. \"He\'s worrying\nvery much about the new building. He has been reading a little, but\nnow\"--Michael Ivanovich went on, lowering his voice--\"now he\'s at\nhis desk, busy with his will, I expect.\" (One of the prince\'s favorite\noccupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant\nto leave at his death and which he called his \"will.\")\n\n\"And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk?\" asked Princess Mary.\n\n\"Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.\"');

He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich\'s hand, put it\nin his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpatych who had\nlong been waiting.\n\nThe prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and,\nwalking up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door, he\ngave his instructions.\n\n\"First, notepaper--do you hear?

He sat down, sank into thought, closed\nhis eyes, and dozed off. Alpatych made a slight movement.\n\n\"Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I\'ll send after you.\"\n\nAlpatych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into\nit, fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at\nthe table to write to the governor.\n\nIt was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished\nto sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing\nthoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tikhon and went through\nthe rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.\n\nHe went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed\nunsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.\nThat couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive\nthoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory\neverywhere, but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was\nbetter than other places: he had never slept there yet.\n\nWith the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and\nbegan putting it up.\n\n\"That\'s not right! That\'s not right!\" cried the prince, and\nhimself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in\nagain.\n\n\"Well, at last I\'ve finished, now I\'ll rest,\" thought the prince,\nand let Tikhon undress him.\n\nFrowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself\nof his coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on\nthe bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously\nat his withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring\nthe moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on\nthe bed. \"Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you\nwould release me!\" thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that\neffort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had\nhe done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards\nbeneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened\nto him almost every night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.\n\n\"No peace, damn them!\" he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. \"Ah\nyes, there was something else important, very important, that I was\nkeeping till I should be in bed.

As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of distant\nfiring, but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the\nsight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and\nwhich was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder.\nThis fact impressed Alpatych, but in thinking about his own business\nhe soon forgot it.\n\nAll the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been\nbounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that\nlimit. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince\'s\norders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych.\n\nOn reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August he put\nup in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by\nFerapontov, where he had been in the habit of putting up for the\nlast thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferapontov, by Alpatych\'s\nadvice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now\nhad a house, an inn, and a corn dealer\'s shop in that province. He was\na stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a\nbroad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and\na round belly.\n\nWearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapontov was standing\nbefore his shop which opened onto the street.

Folks are leaving the town, but you\nhave come to it,\" said he.\n\n\"Why are they leaving the town?\" asked Alpatych.\n\n\"That\'s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.\"\n\n\"Women\'s fuss, women\'s fuss!\" said Alpatych.\n\n\"Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych. What I say is: orders have\nbeen given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants\nare asking three rubles for carting--it isn\'t Christian!\"\n\nYakov Alpatych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for\nhay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.\n\nAll night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning\nAlpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on\nbusiness. It was a sunny morning and by eight o\'clock it was already\nhot. \"A good day for harvesting,\" thought Alpatych.\n\nFrom beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At\neight o\'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of\nmusketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were\nmany soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at\ntheir shops, and service was being held in the churches as usual.\nAlpatych went to the shops, to government offices, to the post office,\nand to the Governor\'s. In the offices and shops and at the post office\neveryone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was\nalready attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be\ndone, and all were trying to calm one another.\n\nIn front of the Governor\'s house Alpatych found a large number of\npeople, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor\'s. At the\nporch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This\nman, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:\n\n\"It\'s no joke, you know! It\'s all very well if you\'re single. \'One\nman though undone is but one,\' as the proverb says, but with\nthirteen in your family and all the property... They\'ve brought us\nto utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do that? They\nought to be hanged--the brigands!...\"\n\n\"Oh come, that\'s enough!\" said the other.\n\n\"What do I care? Let him hear! We\'re not dogs,\" said the\nex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed Alpatych.\n\n\"Oh, Yakov Alpatych! What have you come for?\"\n\n\"To see the Governor by his excellency\'s order,\" answered\nAlpatych, lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the\nbosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince....\n\"He has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs,\" he added.\n\n\"Yes, go and find out!\" shouted the angry gentleman. \"They\'ve\nbrought things to such a pass that there are no carts or\nanything!... There it is again, do you hear?\" said he, pointing\nin the direction whence came the sounds of firing.\n\n\"They\'ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!\" he repeated, and\ndescended the porch steps.\n\nAlpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were\ntradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another.\nThe door of the Governor\'s room opened and they all rose and moved\nforward. An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called\na stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and\nvanished again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and\nquestions addressed to him. Alpatych moved forward and next time the\nofficial came out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of\nhis buttoned coat, and handed him two letters.\n\n\"To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkonski,\"\nhe announced with such solemnity and significance that the official\nturned to him and took the letters.\n\nA few minutes later the Governor received Alpatych and hurriedly\nsaid to him:\n\n\"Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on\nthe highest instructions--here...\" and he handed a paper to\nAlpatych. \"Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they\nshould go to Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them...\"\n\nBut the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into\nthe room and began to say something in French. The Governor\'s face\nexpressed terror.\n\n\"Go,\" he said, nodding his head to Alpatych, and began questioning\nthe officer.\n\nEager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpatych when\nhe came out of the Governor\'s room. Involuntarily listening now to the\nfiring, which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength,\nAlpatych hurried to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor\nsaid this:\n\n\n\"I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the slightest\ndanger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with\nany. I from the one side and Prince Bagration from the other are\nmarching to unite our forces before Smolensk, which junction will be\neffected on the 22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces\nwill defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care\ntill our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland,\nor till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From\nthis you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the\ninhabitants of Smolensk, for those defended by two such brave armies\nmay feel assured of victory.\" (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to\nBaron Asch, the civil governor of Smolensk, 1812.)\n\n\nPeople were anxiously roaming about the streets.\n\nCarts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept\nemerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.\nLoaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapontov\'s and women were\nwailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round\nbarking in front of the harnessed horses.\n\nAlpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went\nstraight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman\nwas asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the\npassage. From the host\'s room came the sounds of a child crying, the\ndespairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of\nFerapontov. The cook began running hither and thither in the passage\nlike a frightened hen, just as Alpatych entered.\n\n\"He\'s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged\nher about so!...\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Alpatych.\n\n\"She kept begging to go away. She\'s a woman! \'Take me away,\' says\nshe, \'don\'t let me perish with my little children! Folks,\' she says,\n\'are all gone, so why,\' she says, \'don\'t we go?\' And he began\nbeating and pulling her about so!\"\n\nAt these words Alpatych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to\nhear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper\'s, where\nhe had left his purchases.\n\n\"You brute, you murderer!\" screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a\nbaby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through\nthe door at that moment and down the steps into the yard.\n\nFerapontov came out after her, but on seeing Alpatych adjusted his\nwaistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpatych into the\nopposite room.\n\n\"Going already?\" said he.\n\nAlpatych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his\npackages and asked how much he owed.\n\n\"We\'ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor\'s?\" asked\nFerapontov. \"What has been decided?\"\n\nAlpatych replied that the Governor had not told him anything\ndefinite.\n\n\"With our business, how can we get away?\" said Ferapontov. \"We\'d\nhave to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and I tell them\nthey\'re not Christians to ask it! Selivanov, now, did a good stroke\nlast Thursday--sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will\nyou have some tea?\" he added.\n\nWhile the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov over\ntheir tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather\nfor harvesting.\n\n\"Well, it seems to be getting quieter,\" remarked Ferapontov,\nfinishing his third cup of tea and getting up. \"Ours must have got the\nbest of it. The orders were not to let them in. So we\'re in force,\nit seems.... They say the other day Matthew Ivanych Platov drove\nthem into the river Marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one\nday.\"\n\nAlpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who\nhad come in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels,\nhoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed\nout.\n\nIt was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in\nshadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpatych looked out of\nthe window and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a\nfar-off whistling and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon\nblending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling.\n\nHe went out into the street: two men were running past toward the\nbridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of\ncannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds\nwere hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside\nthe town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town\nwas being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had\nordered up after four o\'clock. The people did not at once realize\nthe meaning of this bombardment.\n\nAt first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused\ncuriosity. Ferapontov\'s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing\nunder the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the\ngate, listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.\n\nThe cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively\ncuriosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they\nflew over their heads. Several people came round the corner talking\neagerly.\n\n\"What force!\" remarked one. \"Knocked the roof and ceiling all to\nsplinters!\"\n\n\"Routed up the earth like a pig,\" said another.\n\n\"That\'s grand, it bucks one up!\" laughed the first. \"Lucky you\njumped aside, or it would have wiped you out!\"\n\nOthers joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had\nfallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now\nwith the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the\nagreeable intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people\'s heads\nincessantly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpatych\nwas getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.\n\n\"What are you staring at?\" he shouted to the cook, who in her red\nskirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped\nto the corner to listen to what was being said.\n\n\"What marvels!\" she exclaimed, but hearing her master\'s voice she\nturned back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.\n\nOnce more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping\ndownwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the\nstreet, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.\n\n\"Scoundrel, what are you doing?\" shouted the innkeeper, rushing to\nthe cook.\n\nAt that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different\nsides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently\nwith pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was\nher wailing.\n\n\"Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don\'t let me die! My good\nsouls!...\"\n\nFive minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her\nthigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.\nAlpatych, his coachman, Ferapontov\'s wife and children and the house\nporter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns,\nthe whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook,\nwhich rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The\nmistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the\ncellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband\nwho had remained in the street. A shopman who entered told her that\nher husband had gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were\nfetching the wonder-working icon of Smolensk.\n\nToward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpatych left the cellar\nand stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was\nclouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon\nshone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a\nhush seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of\nfootsteps, the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires\nwhich seemed widespread everywhere. The cook\'s moans had now subsided.\nOn two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the\nfires. Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or\nran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined\nant-hill. Several of them ran into Ferapontov\'s yard before Alpatych\'s\neyes. Alpatych went out to the gate. A retreating regiment,\nthronging and hurrying, blocked the street.\n\nNoticing him, an officer said: \"The town is being abandoned. Get\naway, get away!\" and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:\n\n\"I\'ll teach you to run into the yards!\"\n\nAlpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him\nto set off. Ferapontov\'s whole household came out too, following\nAlpatych and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then,\nsuddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires--the smoke and even\nthe flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight--and as if\nin reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of\nthe street. Inside the shed Alpatych and the coachman arranged the\ntangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands.\n\nAs Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers\nin Ferapontov\'s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and\nknapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapontov\nreturned and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about\nto shout at them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair,\nburst into sobs and laughter:\n\n\"Loot everything, lads! Don\'t let those devils get it!\" he cried,\ntaking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.\n\nSome of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on\nfilling their bags. On seeing Alpatych, Ferapontov turned to him:\n\n\"Russia is done for!\" he cried. \"Alpatych, I\'ll set the place on\nfire myself. We\'re done for!...\" and Ferapontov ran into the yard.\n\nSoldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking\nit completely, so that Alpatych could not pass out and had to wait.\nFerapontov\'s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting\ntill it was possible to drive out.\n\nNight had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone\nout amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the\nDnieper Alpatych\'s cart and that of the innkeeper\'s wife, which were\nslowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had\nto stop. In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had\nstopped, a house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already\nburning itself out. The flames now died down and were lost in the\nblack smoke, now suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with\nstrange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the\ncrossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and through\nthe incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be\nheard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some\ntime, Alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the\nfire. Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near\nit, and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning\nbeams into another yard across the street, while others carried\nbundles of hay.\n\nAlpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn\nwhich was blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back\nwall had fallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters\nwere alight. The crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in,\nand Alpatych watched for it too.\n\n\"Alpatych!\" a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.\n\n\"Mercy on us! Your excellency!\" answered Alpatych, immediately\nrecognizing the voice of his young prince.\n\nPrince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was\nlooking at Alpatych from the back of the crowd.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Your... your excellency,\" stammered Alpatych and broke into sobs.\n\"Are we really lost? Master!...\"\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Prince Andrew repeated.\n\nAt that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master\'s\npale worn face. Alpatych told how he had been sent there and how\ndifficult it was to get away.\n\n\"Are we really quite lost, your excellency?\" he asked again.\n\nPrince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his\nknee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his\nsister:\n\n\n\"Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the\nenemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at\nonce when you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyazh.\"\n\n\nHaving written this and given the paper to Alpatych, he told him how\nto arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the\nboy\'s tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before\nhe had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of\nstaff followed by a suite galloped up to him.\n\n\"You are a colonel?\" shouted the chief of staff with a German\naccent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. \"Houses are set on\nfire in your presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You\nwill answer for it!\" shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the\nchief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of\nthe first army, a place, as Berg said, \"very agreeable and well en\nevidence.\"\n\nPrince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to\nAlpatych.\n\n\"So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by\nthe tenth I don\'t receive news that they have all got away I shall\nhave to throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.\"\n\n\"Prince,\" said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, \"I only spoke\nbecause I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly....\nYou must please excuse me,\" he went on apologetically.\n\nSomething cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and\nwreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another\nterrible crash and something huge collapsed.\n\n\"Ou-rou-rou!\" yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the\ncollapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a\ncakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up again, lighting the\nanimated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators.\n\nThe man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:\n\n\"It\'s fine, lads! Now it\'s raging... It\'s fine!\"\n\n\"That\'s the owner himself,\" cried several voices.\n\n\"Well then,\" continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, \"report to them as\nI have told you\"; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute\nbeside him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.');
INSERT INTO `doc` (`doc_id`, `author`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body`) VALUES (NULL,'Leo Tolstoy','War and Peace','BOOK TEN: 1812: CHAPTER V','From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the\nenemy. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was\nmarching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills.\nHeat and drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day\nfleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the\nsun, but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in\nreddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The\nunreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up.\nThe cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched\nmeadows. Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was\nthere any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along which the\ntroops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or when\nthe road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the\nsandy dust churned up more than six inches deep. As soon as day dawned\nthe march began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly\nthrough the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and\nthe infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that\nnever cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the\nfeet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the\ntroops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all\nin the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road.\nThe higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and\nthrough the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked\neye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded\nsky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless\natmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses\nand mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to\nthe wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.\n\nPrince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of\nthat regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving\nand giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolensk and its\nabandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger\nagainst the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely\ndevoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to\nhis men and officers. In the regiment they called him \"our prince,\"\nwere proud of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to\nthose of his regiment, to Timokhin and the like--people quite new to\nhim, belonging to a different world and who could not know and\nunderstand his past. As soon as he came across a former acquaintance\nor anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately and grew\nspiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded him\nof his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that\nformer circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not\nto be unfair.\n\nIn truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to\nPrince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the\nsixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been\ndefended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow,\nabandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built\nand peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew\nhad something to think about entirely apart from general questions.\nTwo days previously he had received news that his father, son, and\nsister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do\nat Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment\nhis own grief decided that he must ride there.\n\nHe ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on\nthe march, rode to his father\'s estate where he had been born and\nspent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to\nbe dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it\nwith wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul\nabout and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and\nhalf submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He\nrode to the keeper\'s lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of\nthe drive and the door stood open. Grass had already begun to grow\non the garden paths, and horses and calves were straying in the\nEnglish park. Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass\npanes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and\nothers dried up. He called for Taras the gardener, but no one replied.\nHaving gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden,\nhe saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the\nplum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom\nPrince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was\nsitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.\n\nHe was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting\non the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him\nstrips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a\nmagnolia.\n\nPrince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old\ngarden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were\nwandering in front of the house among the rosebushes. The shutters\nwere all closed, except at one window which was open. A little serf\nboy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Alpatych, having sent\nhis family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors\nreading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince Andrew had\ncome, he went out with his spectacles on his nose, buttoning his coat,\nand, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping and kissing\nPrince Andrew\'s knee.\n\nThen, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to\nreport on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable\nhad been removed to Bogucharovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also\nbeen carted away. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alpatych\nsaid there had been a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered\nby the troops and mown down while still green. The peasants were\nruined; some of them too had gone to Bogucharovo, only a few remained.\n\nWithout waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:\n\n\"When did my father and sister leave?\" meaning when did they leave\nfor Moscow.\n\nAlpatych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for\nBogucharovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again\nwent into details concerning the estate management, asking for\ninstructions.\n\n\"Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for\nthem? We have still six hundred quarters left,\" he inquired.\n\n\"What am I to say to him?\" thought Prince Andrew, looking down on\nthe old man\'s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the\nexpression on his face that the old man himself understood how\nuntimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief.\n\n\"Yes, let them have it,\" replied Prince Andrew.\n\n\"If you noticed some disorder in the garden,\" said Alpatych, \"it was\nimpossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the\nnight, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their\ncommanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.\"\n\n\"Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy\noccupies the place?\" asked Prince Andrew.\n\nAlpatych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and\nsuddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm.\n\n\"He is my refuge! His will be done!\" he exclaimed.\n\nA group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow\ntoward the prince.\n\n\"Well, good-by!\" said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpatych.\n\"You must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go\nto the Ryazan estate or to the one near Moscow.\"\n\nAlpatych clung to Prince Andrew\'s leg and burst into sobs. Gently\ndisengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the\navenue at a gallop.\n\nThe old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly\nimpassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on\nwhich he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out\nfrom the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked\nfrom the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young\nmaster, the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger\ncompanion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not\nstopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped.\n\nPrince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them\nsee that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty\nfrightened little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt\nan irresistible desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief\ncame over him when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of\nother human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as\nlegitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these girls\npassionately desired one thing--to carry away and eat those green\nplums without being caught--and Prince Andrew shared their wish for\nthe success of their enterprise. He could not resist looking at them\nonce more. Believing their danger past, they sprang from their\nambush and, chirruping something in their shrill little voices and\nholding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned feet scampered\nmerrily and quickly across the meadow grass.\n\nPrince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the\ndusty highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from\nBald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment\nat its halting place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one\no\'clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his\nback intolerably through his black coat. The dust always hung\nmotionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops.\nThere was no wind. As he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the\nooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to get into that water,\nhowever dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from\nwhence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, green\npond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because\nit was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red\nhands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it. All this\nnaked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in\nthat dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the\nsuggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially\npathetic.\n\nOne fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince\nAndrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed\nhimself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water;\nanother, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood\nup to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure\nand snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head\nwith hands blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men\nslapping one another, yelling, and puffing.\n\nEverywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was\nhealthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timokhin, with his red\nlittle nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt\nconfused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind to address him\nnevertheless.\n\n\"It\'s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn\'t you like to?\" said he.\n\n\"It\'s dirty,\" replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.\n\n\"We\'ll clear it out for you in a minute,\" said Timokhin, and,\nstill undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.\n\n\"The prince wants to bathe.\"\n\n\"What prince? Ours?\" said many voices, and the men were in such\nhaste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He\ndecided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn.\n\n\"Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!\" he thought, and he looked at his own\nnaked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust\nand horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that\nimmense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.\n\n\nOn the seventh of August Prince Bagration wrote as follows from\nhis quarters at Mikhaylovna on the Smolensk road:\n\n\nDear Count Alexis Andreevich--(He was writing to Arakcheev but\nknew that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore\nweighed every word in it to the best of his ability.)\n\nI expect the Minister [Barclay de Tolly] has already reported the\nabandonment of Smolensk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and\nthe whole army is in despair that this most important place has been\nwantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most\nurgently and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to\nconsent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as\nnever before and might have lost half his army but could not have\ntaken Smolensk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, as never\nbefore. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at bay for\nthirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold out even for\nfourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for\nhim, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our\nlosses were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not\nmore, and not even that; but even were they ten thousand, that\'s\nwar! But the enemy has lost masses...\n\nWhat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They\nwould have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water\nfor men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but\nsuddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. We\ncannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow...\n\nThere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you\nshould make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats!\nYou would set all Russia against you and every one of us would feel\nashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this--we must fight\nas long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand...\n\nOne man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may\nperhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad\nbut execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole\ncountry.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing\nboldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a\npeace, and that the Minister should command the army, does not love\nour sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. So I write you\nfrankly: call out the militia. For the Minister is leading these\nvisitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way. The whole army\nfeels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is\nsaid to be more Napoleon\'s man than ours, and he is always advising\nthe Minister. I am not merely civil to him but obey him like a\ncorporal, though I am his senior. This is painful, but, loving my\nbenefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am sorry for the Emperor\nthat he entrusts our fine army to such as he. Consider that on our\nretreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than\nfifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would not have\nhappened. Tell me, for God\'s sake, what will Russia, our mother\nRussia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning\nour good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings\nof hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and\nof whom are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is\nvacillating, a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The\nwhole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him...');

To the latter--as\ndistinguished from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow\nlife--we may allot Petersburg life, and especially the life of its\nsalons. That life of the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805\nwe had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had\nmade constitutions and unmade them again, but the salons of Anna\nPavlovna and Helene remained just as they had been--the one seven and\nthe other five years before. At Anna Pavlovna\'s they talked with\nperplexity of Bonaparte\'s successes just as before and saw in them and\nin the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a\nmalicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause\nunpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna\nPavlovna was the representative. And in Helene\'s salon, which\nRumyantsev himself honored with his visits, regarding Helene as a\nremarkably intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in\n1812 as in 1808 of the \"great nation\" and the \"great man,\" and\nregretted our rupture with France, a rupture which, according to them,\nought to be promptly terminated by peace.\n\nOf late, since the Emperor\'s return from the army, there had been some\nexcitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of\nhostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In\nAnna Pavlovna\'s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were\ndeep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the\neffect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to\nmaintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole\narmy corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the\nreports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French\ncircle of Helene and Rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy\nand of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon\'s attempts at\nconciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those\nwho advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazan of the court and\nthe girls\' educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager\nEmpress. In Helene\'s circle the war in general was regarded as a series\nof formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the\nview prevailed expressed by Bilibin--who now in Petersburg was quite at\nhome in Helene\'s house, which every clever man was obliged to\nvisit--that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters\nbe settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm--news of which had\nreached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor\'s return--was\nridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this\nenthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the\nancients. Prince Vasili, who still occupied his former important\nposts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He\nvisited his \"good friend Anna Pavlovna\" as well as his daughter\'s\n\"diplomatic salon,\" and often in his constant comings and goings\nbetween the two camps became confused and said at Helene\'s what he\nshould have said at Anna Pavlovna\'s and vice versa.\n\nSoon after the Emperor\'s return Prince Vasili in a conversation\nabout the war at Anna Pavlovna\'s severely condemned Barclay de\nTolly, but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander\nin chief. One of the visitors, usually spoken of as \"a man of great\nmerit,\" having described how he had that day seen Kutuzov, the newly\nchosen chief of the Petersburg militia, presiding over the\nenrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest\nthat Kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements.\n\nAnna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutuzov had done\nnothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.\n\n\"I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,\" Prince\nVasili interrupted, \"but they did not listen to me. I told them his\nelection as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They\ndid not listen to me.\n\n\"It\'s all this mania for opposition,\" he went on. \"And who for? It is\nall because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those\nMuscovites,\" Prince Vasili continued, forgetting for a moment that\nthough at Helene\'s one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna\nPavlovna\'s one had to be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his\nmistake at once. \"Now, is it suitable that Count Kutuzov, the oldest\ngeneral in Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He will get\nnothing for his pains! How could they make a man commander in chief\nwho cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the\nvery worst morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest!\nI don\'t speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this\nhow they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively blind? A fine\nidea to have a blind general! He can\'t see anything. To play\nblindman\'s bluff? He can\'t see at all!\"\n\nNo one replied to his remarks.\n\nThis was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the\ntwenty-ninth of July Kutuzov received the title of Prince. This\nmight indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasili\'s\nopinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry\nto express it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting\nof Field Marshal Saltykov, Arakcheev, Vyazmitinov, Lopukhin, and\nKochubey met to consider the progress of the war. This committee\ncame to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity\nin the command and though the members of the committee were aware of\nthe Emperor\'s dislike of Kutuzov, after a short deliberation they\nagreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief. That same\nday Kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the\narmies and over the whole region occupied by them.\n\nOn the ninth of August Prince Vasili at Anna Pavlovna\'s again met\nthe \"man of great merit.\" The latter was very attentive to Anna\nPavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the\neducational establishments for young ladies. Prince Vasili entered the\nroom with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object\nof his desires.\n\n\"Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutuzov is field\nmarshal! All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At\nlast we have a man!\" said he, glancing sternly and significantly round\nat everyone in the drawing room.\n\nThe \"man of great merit,\" despite his desire to obtain the post of\ndirector, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasili of his former\nopinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasili in Anna\nPavlovna\'s drawing room, and also to Anna Pavlovna herself who had\nreceived the news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.\n\n\"But, Prince, they say he is blind!\" said he, reminding Prince\nVasili of his own words.\n\n\"Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,\" said Prince Vasili rapidly,\nin a deep voice and with a slight cough--the voice and cough with\nwhich he was wont to dispose of all difficulties.\n\n\"He sees well enough,\" he added. \"And what I am so pleased about,\"\nhe went on, \"is that our sovereign has given him full powers over\nall the armies and the whole region--powers no commander in chief ever\nhad before. He is a second autocrat,\" he concluded with a victorious\nsmile.\n\n\"God grant it! God grant it!\" said Anna Pavlovna.\n\nThe \"man of great merit,\" who was still a novice in court circles,\nwishing to flatter Anna Pavlovna by defending her former position on\nthis question, observed:\n\n\"It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutuzov those\npowers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read,\nwhen he said to Kutuzov: \'Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you\nthis honor.\'\"\n\n\"Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,\" said Anna Pavlovna.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" warmly rejoined Prince Vasili, who would not now yield\nKutuzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutuzov was not only admirable\nhimself, but was adored by everybody. \"No, that\'s impossible,\" said\nhe, \"for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.\"\n\n\"God grant only that Prince Kutuzov assumes real power and does\nnot allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,\" observed Anna Pavlovna.\n\nUnderstanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasili said in a\nwhisper:\n\n\"I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition that\nthe Tsarevich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to\nthe Emperor?\"\n\nAnd Prince Vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by\nKutuzov to the Emperor. \"I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor\nreward him if he does right.\"\n\n\"Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutuzov! I have known him a long\ntime!\"\n\n\"They even say,\" remarked the \"man of great merit\" who did not yet\npossess courtly tact, \"that his excellency made it an express\ncondition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.\"\n\nAs soon as he said this both Prince Vasili and Anna Pavlovna\nturned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at\nhis naivete.');

He is as right as other historians who look for the\nexplanation of historic events in the will of one man; he is as\nright as the Russian historians who maintain that Napoleon was drawn\nto Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders. Here besides the law\nof retrospection, which regards all the past as a preparation for\nevents that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity comes in,\nconfusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer having lost a game is\nsincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made\nand looks for that mistake in the opening, but forgets that at each\nstage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his\nmoves were perfect. He only notices the mistake to which he pays\nattention, because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more\ncomplex than this is the game of war, which occurs under certain\nlimits of time, and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless\nobjects, but everything results from innumerable conflicts of\nvarious wills!\n\nAfter Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobuzh at Vyazma,\nand then at Tsarevo-Zaymishche, but it happened that owing to a\nconjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give\nbattle till they reached Borodino, seventy miles from Moscow. From\nVyazma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow.\n\nMoscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacree\ndes peuples d\'Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme\nde pagodes chinoises,* this Moscow gave Napoleon\'s imagination no\nrest. On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light\nbay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his\npages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind\nto question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by\nLelorgne d\'Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a\ngallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression.\n\n\n*\"Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the sacred\ncity of Alexander\'s people, Moscow with its innumerable churches\nshaped like Chinese pagodas.\"\n\n\n\"Well?\" asked Napoleon.\n\n\"One of Platov\'s Cossacks says that Platov\'s corps is joining up\nwith the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander in\nchief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.\"\n\nNapoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and\nbring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several\nadjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavrushka, the serf Denisov\nhad handed over to Rostov, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly\'s\njacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face.\nNapoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.\n\n\"You are a Cossack?\"\n\n\"Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.\"\n\n\"The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon\'s\nplain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental\nmind the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the\nincidents of the war,\" says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality\nLavrushka, having got drunk the day before and left his master\ndinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of\nchickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him\nprisoner. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who\nhave seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do\neverything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort\nof service to their master, and are keen at guessing their master\'s\nbaser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness.\n\nFinding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had\neasily and surely recognized, Lavrushka was not in the least abashed\nbut merely did his utmost to gain his new master\'s favor.\n\nHe knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon\'s presence\ncould no more intimidate him than Rostov\'s, or a sergeant major\'s with\nthe rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant\nmajor or Napoleon could deprive him of.\n\nSo he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the\norderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the\nRussians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrushka screwed\nup his eyes and considered.\n\nIn this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see\ncunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.\n\n\"It\'s like this,\" he said thoughtfully, \"if there\'s a battle soon,\nyours will win. That\'s right. But if three days pass, then after that,\nwell, then that same battle will not soon be over.\"\n\nLelorgne d\'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon\nthus: \"If a battle takes place within the next three days the French\nwill win, but if later, God knows what will happen.\" Napoleon did\nnot smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, and he\nordered these words to be repeated.\n\nLavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending\nnot to know who Napoleon was, added:\n\n\"We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in\nthe world, but we are a different matter...\"--without knowing why or\nhow this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.\n\nThe interpreter translated these words without the last phrase,\nand Bonaparte smiled. \"The young Cossack made his mighty\ninterlocutor smile,\" says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence,\nNapoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news\nthat he was talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who\nhad written his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would\naffect this enfant du Don.*\n\n\n*\"Child of the Don.\"\n\n\nThe fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka.\n\nLavrushka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and\nthat Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new\nmasters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his\neyes wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken\nto be whipped. \"As soon as Napoleon\'s interpreter had spoken,\" says\nThiers, \"the Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word,\nbut rode on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached\nhim across the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly\narrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration.\nNapoleon, after making the Cossack a present, had him set free like\na bird restored to its native fields.\"\n\nNapoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his\nimagination, and \"the bird restored to its native fields\" galloped\nto our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but\nthat he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place\nhe did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth\ntelling. He found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating\nwith Platov\'s detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas\nRostov, quartered at Yankovo. Rostov was just mounting to go for a\nride round the neighboring villages with Ilyin; he let Lavrushka\nhave another horse and took him along with him.');

He ordered the militiamen to be\ncalled up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the\ncommander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at\nBald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the\ncommander in chief\'s discretion to take measures or not for the\ndefense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia\'s oldest generals would\nbe captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would\nremain at Bald Hills.\n\nBut while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the\ndeparture of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to\nBogucharovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her\nfather\'s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy,\ncould not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in\nher life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her\nfather\'s fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every\ninjustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told\nher she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had\nharbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life\nto poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her\nthat if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared\nthat he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to\ndare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as she had\nfeared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to\nlet him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in\nthe depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had\nnot gone away.\n\nThe morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned\nhis full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His\ncaleche was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the\nhouse in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden\nto review his armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window\nlistening to his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly\nseveral men came running up the avenue with frightened faces.\n\nPrincess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path,\nand into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were\nmoving toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by\nthe armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and\ndecorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that\nfell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,\ncould not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see\nwas that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one\nof timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his\nhelpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out\nwhat he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on\nthe very couch he had so feared of late.\n\nThe doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said\nthat the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.\n\nIt was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and\nnext day they moved the prince to Bogucharovo, the doctor accompanying\nhim.\n\nBy the time they reached Bogucharovo, Dessalles and the little\nprince had already left for Moscow.\n\nFor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the\nnew house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo, ever in the same\nstate, getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay\nlike a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and\nlips twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood\nwhat was going on around him or not. One thing was certain--that he\nwas suffering and wished to say something. But what it was, no one\ncould tell: it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man,\nor it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.\n\nThe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was\ndue to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell\nher something, and the fact that her presence always increased his\nrestlessness confirmed her opinion.\n\nHe was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was\nno hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not\ndo to let him die on the road. \"Would it not be better if the end\ndid come, the very end?\" Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and\nday, hardly sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say,\noften watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but\nwishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end.\n\nStrange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet\nthere it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that\nsince her father\'s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed\nwith him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires\nand hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened.\nThoughts that had not entered her mind for years--thoughts of a life\nfree from the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and\nof family happiness--floated continually in her imagination like\ntemptations of the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions\ncontinually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now,\nafter that. These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew\nit. She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she\ntried to pray. She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons,\nrepeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt\nthat a different world had now taken possession of her--the life of\na world of strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual\nworld in which till now she had been confined and in which her\ngreatest comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not\nweep, and worldly cares took possession of her.\n\nIt was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo. News of the\napproach of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten\nmiles from Bogucharovo, a homestead had been looted by French\nmarauders.\n\nThe doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the\nprovincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary\nto persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of\nthe rural police having come to Bogucharovo urged the same thing,\nsaying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that\nFrench proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the\nprincess did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could\nnot answer for the consequences.\n\nThe princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of\npreparation and giving orders, for which everyone came to her,\noccupied her all day. She spent the night of the fourteenth as\nusual, without undressing, in the room next to the one where the\nprince lay. Several times, waking up, she heard his groans and\nmuttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of Tikhon and the\ndoctor when they turned him over. Several times she listened at the\ndoor, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than\nusual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not sleep and\nseveral times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter but\nnot deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw\nand knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to\nhim. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look\nshe sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in\nduring the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.\n\nBut never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of\nlosing him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and\nact of his found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid\nthese memories temptations of the devil would surge into her\nimagination: thoughts of how things would be after his death, and\nhow her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove these\nthoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he became quiet and she\nfell asleep.\n\nShe woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed\nher clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father\'s illness.\nOn waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and,\nhearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were\nstill the same.\n\n\"But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!\"\nshe cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.\n\nShe washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In\nfront of it stood carriages without horses and things were being\npacked into the vehicles.\n\nIt was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch,\nstill horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her\nthoughts before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and\nwent out to her.\n\n\"He is a little better today,\" said he. \"I was looking for you.\nOne can make out something of what he is saying. His head is\nclearer. Come in, he is asking for you...\"\n\nPrincess Mary\'s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew\npale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him,\ntalk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was\noverflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment\nof joy and terror.\n\n\"Come,\" said the doctor.\n\nPrincess Mary entered her father\'s room and went up to his bed. He\nwas lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with\ntheir knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed\nstraight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips\nmotionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His\nface seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown\nsmaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand\npressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting\nfor her to come. He twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered\nangrily.\n\nShe looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her.\nWhen she changed her position so that his left eye could see her\nface he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds.\nThen his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak,\ngazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might\nnot understand.\n\nStraining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic\nefforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with\ndifficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said\nsomething, repeating the same words several times. She could not\nunderstand them, but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly\nrepeated the words he uttered.\n\n\"Mmm...ar...ate...ate...\" he repeated several times.\n\nIt was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor\nthought he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: \"Mary, are\nyou afraid?\" The prince shook his head, again repeated the same\nsounds.\n\n\"My mind, my mind aches?\" questioned Princess Mary.\n\nHe made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and\nbegan pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to\nfind the right place for it.\n\n\"Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...\" he then uttered much\nmore clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being\nunderstood.\n\nPrincess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide\nher sobs and tears.\n\nHe moved his hand over her hair.\n\n\"I have been calling you all night...\" he brought out.\n\n\"If only I had known...\" she said through her tears. \"I was afraid\nto come in.\"\n\nHe pressed her hand.\n\n\"Weren\'t you asleep?\"\n\n\"No, I did not sleep,\" said Princess Mary, shaking her head.\n\nUnconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself\nas he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed\nto move with difficulty.\n\n\"Dear one... Dearest...\" Princess Mary could not quite make out what\nhe had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a\ntender caressing word such as he had never used to her before. \"Why\ndidn\'t you come in?\"\n\n\"And I was wishing for his death!\" thought Princess Mary.\n\nHe was silent awhile.\n\n\"Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!...\nthank you!... forgive!... thank you!...\" and tears began to flow\nfrom his eyes. \"Call Andrew!\" he said suddenly, and a childish,\ntimid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.\n\nHe himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least\nit seemed to Princess Mary.\n\n\"I have a letter from him,\" she replied.\n\nHe glanced at her with timid surprise.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He\'s with the army, Father, at Smolensk.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in\nanswer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood\nand remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, softly and distinctly. \"Russia has perished. They\'ve\ndestroyed her.\"\n\nAnd he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes.\nPrincess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she\ngazed at his face.\n\nAgain he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes,\nand Tikhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.\n\nThen he again opened his eyes and said something none of them\ncould understand for a long time, till at last Tikhon understood and\nrepeated it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in\nthe mood in which he had just been speaking. She thought he was\nspeaking of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson,\nor of his own death, and so she could not guess his words.\n\n\"Put on your white dress. I like it,\" was what he said.\n\nHaving understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the\ndoctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and\ntrying to persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left\nthe room the prince again began speaking about his son, about the war,\nand about the Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his\nhoarse voice, and then he had a second and final stroke.\n\nPrincess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot\nand sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel\nnothing, except passionate love for her father, love such as she\nthought she had never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing\ninto the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues of young\nlime trees Prince Andrew had planted.\n\n\"Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end\nquicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me?\nWhat use will peace be when he is no longer here?\" Princess Mary\nmurmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her\nhands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs.\n\nWhen she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her\nagain to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne--who had remained\nat Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it--coming toward her with\na stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district,\nwho had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for\nher prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding\nhim; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with\nhim. Then, excusing herself, she went to the door of the old\nprince\'s room. The doctor came out with an agitated face and said\nshe could not enter.\n\n\"Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!\"\n\nShe returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot\nof the slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know\nhow long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a\nwoman\'s footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyasha\nher maid, who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped\nsuddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress.\n\n\"Please come, Princess... The Prince,\" said Dunyasha in a breaking\nvoice.\n\n\"Immediately, I\'m coming, I\'m coming!\" replied the princess\nhurriedly, not giving Dunyasha time to finish what she was saying, and\ntrying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.\n\n\"Princess, it\'s God\'s will! You must be prepared for everything,\"\nsaid the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.\n\n\"Let me alone; it\'s not true!\" she cried angrily to him.\n\nThe doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her\nfather\'s door. \"Why are these people with frightened faces stopping\nme? I don\'t want any of them! And what are they doing here?\" she\nthought. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that\npreviously darkened room startled her. In the room were her nurse\nand other women. They all drew back from the bed, making way for\nher. He was still lying on the bed as before, but the stern expression\nof his quiet face made Princess Mary stop short on the threshold.\n\n\"No, he\'s not dead--it\'s impossible!\" she told herself and\napproached him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed\nher lips to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force\nof the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly\nand was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before\nher. \"No, he is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something\nunfamiliar and hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent\nmystery!\" And hiding her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into\nthe arms of the doctor, who held her up.\n\n\nIn the presence of Tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had\nbeen the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth\nshould not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied\ntogether the legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed\nhim in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little\nbody on a table. Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but\nit all got done as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were\nburning round his coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was\nstrewn with sprays of juniper, a printed band was tucked in under\nhis shriveled head, and in a corner of the room sat a chanter\nreading the psalms.\n\nJust as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the\ninmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round\nthe coffin--the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women--and all\nwith fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and\nkissed the old prince\'s cold and stiffened hand.');

They differed from them in speech, dress,\nand disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used\nto approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to\nBald Hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches,\nbut he disliked them for their boorishness.\n\nPrince Andrew\'s last stay at Bogucharovo, when he introduced\nhospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to\npay, had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary\nstrengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called\nboorishness. Various obscure rumors were always current among them: at\none time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at\nanother of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; then\nof some proclamation of the Tsar\'s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul\nin 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been\ngranted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of Peter\nFedorovich\'s return to the throne in seven years\' time, when\neverything would be made free and so \"simple\" that there would be no\nrestrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were\nconnected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of\nAntichrist, the end of the world, and \"pure freedom.\"\n\nIn the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging to\nthe crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work\nwhere they pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the\nneighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in\nthe lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents\nin the life of the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are\nso baffling to contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly\nnoticeable than among others. One instance, which had occurred some\ntwenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to emigrate\nto some unknown \"warm rivers.\" Hundreds of peasants, among them the\nBogucharovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in\nwhole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere\nbeyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to\nthe southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off\nin caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or\nwalked toward the \"warm rivers.\" Many of them were punished, some sent\nto Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of\ntheir own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it\nhad sprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still\nexisted among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest\nthemselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time\nsimply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in\nclose touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents\nwere acting strongly and nearing an eruption.\n\nAlpatych, who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old\nprince\'s death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that\ncontrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where\nover a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and\nleaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the\npeasants in the steppe region round Bogucharovo were, it was\nrumored, in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that\npassed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learned from\ndomestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great\ninfluence in the village commune and had recently been away driving\na government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks\nwere destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not harm\nthem. Alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant\nhad even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which was occupied\nby the French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would\nbe done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid\nfor anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought\nfrom Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that\nthey were false) paid to him in advance for hay.\n\nMore important still, Alpatych learned that on the morning of the\nvery day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the\nprincess\' luggage from Bogucharovo, there had been a village meeting\nat which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no\ntime to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince\'s death,\nthe Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary\'s leaving at once, as it was\nbecoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he\ncould not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of\nthe day the old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return\nnext day for the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he\nreceived tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had\nbarely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.\n\nFor some thirty years Bogucharovo had been managed by the village\nElder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive \"Dronushka.\"\n\nDron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants\nwho grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged\ntill they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a\ntooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.\n\nSoon after the migration to the \"warm rivers,\" in which he had taken\npart like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of\nBogucharovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for\ntwenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their\nmaster. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the\nsteward respected him and jestingly called him \"the Minister.\"\nDuring the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill,\nnever after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the\nleast fatigue, and though he could not read he had never forgotten a\nsingle money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of\nthe endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of\nthe whole corn crop on any single acre of the Bogucharovo fields.\n\nAlpatych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for\nhis Dron on the day of the prince\'s funeral and told him to have\ntwelve horses got ready for the princess\' carriages and eighteen carts\nfor the things to be removed from Bogucharovo. Though the peasants\npaid quitrent, Alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about\ncomplying with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty\nhouseholds at work in Bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do.\nBut on hearing the order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent.\nAlpatych named certain peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take\nthe carts.\n\nDron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.\nAlpatych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no\nhorses available: some horses were carting for the government,\nothers were too weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It\nseemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages, much less\nfor the carting.\n\nAlpatych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a\nmodel village Elder, so Alpatych had not managed the prince\'s\nestates for twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in\nthe highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts\nof those he dealt with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood\nthat his answers did not express his personal views but the general\nmood of the Bogucharovo commune, by which the Elder had already been\ncarried away. But he also knew that Dron, who had acquired property\nand was hated by the commune, must be hesitating between the two\ncamps: the masters\' and the serfs\'. He noticed this hesitation in\nDron\'s look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him.\n\n\"Now just listen, Dronushka,\" said he. \"Don\'t talk nonsense to me.\nHis excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the\npeople away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order\nfrom the Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar.\nDo you hear?\"\n\n\"I hear,\" Dron answered without lifting his eyes.\n\nAlpatych was not satisfied with this reply.\n\n\"Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!\" he said, shaking his head.\n\n\"The power is in your hands,\" Dron rejoined sadly.\n\n\"Eh, Dron, drop it!\" Alpatych repeated, withdrawing his hand from\nhis bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron\'s feet. \"I can\nsee through you and three yards into the ground under you,\" he\ncontinued, gazing at the floor in front of Dron.\n\nDron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpatych and again\nlowered his eyes.\n\n\"You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave\ntheir homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow\nmorning for the princess\' things. And don\'t go to any meeting\nyourself, do you hear?\"\n\nDron suddenly fell on his knees.\n\n\"Yakov Alpatych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge\nme, for Christ\'s sake!\"\n\n\"Stop that!\" cried Alpatych sternly. \"I see through you and three\nyards under you,\" he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping,\nhis knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that\nhe had been able to retain the old prince\'s favor for twenty years had\nlong since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the\npower of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute\nof wizards.\n\nDron got up and was about to say something, but Alpatych interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you\nthinking of, eh?\"\n\n\"What am I to do with the people?\" said Dron. \"They\'re quite\nbeside themselves; I have already told them...\"\n\n\"\'Told them,\' I dare say!\" said Alpatych. \"Are they drinking?\" he\nasked abruptly.\n\n\"Quite beside themselves, Yakov Alpatych; they\'ve fetched another\nbarrel.\"\n\n\"Well, then, listen! I\'ll go to the police officer, and you tell\nthem so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got\nready.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nAlpatych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long\ntime and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no\nsuspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive \"I\nunderstand\" from Dron, Alpatych contented himself with that, though he\nnot only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of\ntroops the carts would not be forthcoming.\n\nAnd so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided.\nIn the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being\nheld, which decided that the horses should be driven out into the\nwoods and the carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of\nthis to the princess, Alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the\ncarts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready\nfor the princess\' carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police\nauthorities.');

A maid came to the door to say that Alpatych\nwas asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk\nwith Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she\nhad been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not\nmean to go away and begged to be left in peace.\n\nThe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward.\nShe lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons\nof the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her\nconfused thoughts were centered on one subject--the irrevocability\nof death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not\nsuspected, but which had shown itself during her father\'s illness. She\nwished to pray but did not dare to, dared not in her present state\nof mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time in that\nposition.\n\nThe sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting\nrays shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of\nthe morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of\nher thoughts suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed\nher hair, got up, and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the\nfreshness of the clear but windy evening.\n\n\"Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will\nhinder you,\" she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her\nhead fall on the window sill.\n\nSomeone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden\nand kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a\nblack dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary,\nsighed, kissed her, and immediately began to cry. The princess\nlooked up at her. All their former disharmony and her own jealousy\nrecurred to her mind. But she remembered too how he had changed of\nlate toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could not bear to see her,\nthereby showing how unjust were the reproaches Princess Mary had\nmentally addressed to her. \"Besides, is it for me, for me who\ndesired his death, to condemn anyone?\" she thought.\n\nPrincess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of\nMademoiselle Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but\nwho yet was dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry\nfor her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry.\nMademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that\nhand, speaking of the princess\' sorrow and making herself a partner in\nit. She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess\nallowed her to share her sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings\nshould sink into nothing but this great grief; that she felt herself\nblameless in regard to everyone, and that he, from above, saw her\naffection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not heeding her words\nbut occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her\nvoice.\n\n\"Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,\" said Mademoiselle\nBourienne after a pause. \"I understand that you could not, and cannot,\nthink of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has\nAlpatych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?\" she asked.\n\nPrincess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go\nor where to. \"Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it\nnot all the same?\" she thought, and did not reply.\n\n\"You know, chere Marie,\" said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \"that we are\nin danger--are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move\nnow. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God\nknows...\"\n\nPrincess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she\nwas talking about.\n\n\"Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,\" she\nsaid. \"Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him....\nAlpatych did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do\nnothing, nothing, and don\'t want to....\"\n\n\"I\'ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away\ntomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay here,\" said\nMademoiselle Bourienne. \"Because, you will agree, chere Marie, to fall\ninto the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be\nterrible.\"\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not\nprinted on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau\'s, telling people\nnot to leave their homes and that the French authorities would\nafford them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.\n\n\"I think it would be best to appeal to that general,\" she continued,\n\"and I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.\"\n\nPrincess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with\nstifled sobs.\n\n\"From whom did you get this?\" she asked.\n\n\"They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,\" replied\nMademoiselle Bourienne blushing.\n\nPrincess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window\nand with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been\nPrince Andrew\'s study.\n\n\"Dunyasha, send Alpatych, or Dronushka, or somebody to me!\" she\nsaid, \"and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,\" she\nadded, hearing Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s voice. \"We must go at once, at\nonce!\" she said, appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of\nthe French.\n\n\"If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French!\nThat I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, asked General\nRameau for protection and accepted his favor!\" This idea horrified\nher, made her shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and\npride as she had never experienced before. All that was distressing,\nand especially all that was humiliating, in her position rose\nvividly to her mind. \"They, the French, would settle in this house: M.\nle General Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew\'s study and amuse himself\nby looking through and reading his letters and papers. Mademoiselle\nBourienne would do the honors of Bogucharovo for him. I should be\ngiven a small room as a favor, the soldiers would violate my\nfather\'s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars, they would\ntell me of their victories over the Russians, and would pretend to\nsympathize with my sorrow...\" thought Princess Mary, not thinking\nher own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her\nbrother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what\nhappened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead\nfather and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their\nthoughts and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what\nthey would have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into\nPrince Andrew\'s study, trying to enter completely into his ideas,\nand considered her position.\n\nThe demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her\nfather\'s death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously\nunknown force and took possession of her.\n\nAgitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael\nIvanovich and now for Tikhon or Dron. Dunyasha, the nurse, and the\nother maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s\nstatement was correct. Alpatych was not at home, he had gone to the\npolice. Neither could the architect Michael Ivanovich, who on being\nsent for came in with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With\njust the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had\nbeen accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of\nhis own, he now replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite\ncould be got from his answers. The old valet Tikhon, with sunken,\nemaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief, replied:\n\"Yes, Princess\" to all Princess Mary\'s questions and hardly\nrefrained from sobbing as he looked at her.\n\nAt length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a\ndeep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.\n\nPrincess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of\nhim.\n\n\"Dronushka,\" she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dronushka who\nalways used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to\nthe fair at Vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her,\n\"Dronushka, now since our misfortune...\" she began, but could not go\non.\n\n\"We are all in God\'s hands,\" said he, with a sigh.\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\"Dronushka, Alpatych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to\nturn to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can\'t even go away?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn\'t you go away, your excellency? You can go,\" said Dron.\n\n\"I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend,\nI can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go\naway tonight or early tomorrow morning.\"\n\nDron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: \"There are\nno horses; I told Yakov Alpatych so.\"\n\n\"Why are there none?\" asked the princess.\n\n\"It\'s all God\'s scourge,\" said Dron. \"What horses we had have been\ntaken for the army or have died--this is such a year! It\'s not a\ncase of feeding horses--we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some\ngo three days without eating. We\'ve nothing, we\'ve been ruined.\"\n\nPrincess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.\n\n\"The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?\" she asked.\n\n\"They\'re dying of hunger,\" said Dron. \"It\'s not a case of carting.\"\n\n\"But why didn\'t you tell me, Dronushka? Isn\'t it possible to help\nthem? I\'ll do all I can....\"\n\nTo Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such\nsorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor,\nand the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard\nvaguely that there was such a thing as \"landlord\'s corn\" which was\nsometimes given to the peasants. She also knew that neither her father\nnor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need, she only\nfeared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of\nthe grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares presented\nthemselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief.\nShe began asking Dron about the peasants\' needs and what there was\nin Bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord.\n\n\"But we have grain belonging to my brother?\" she said.\n\n\"The landlord\'s grain is all safe,\" replied Dron proudly. \"Our\nprince did not order it to be sold.\"\n\n\"Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you\nleave in my brother\'s name,\" said she.\n\nDron made no answer but sighed deeply.\n\n\"Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all.\nI give this order in my brother\'s name; and tell them that what is\nours is theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.\"\n\nDron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.\n\n\"Discharge me, little mother, for God\'s sake! Order the keys to be\ntaken from me,\" said he. \"I have served twenty-three years and have\ndone no wrong.

It\'s all a trick,\" said Dunyasha, \"and when\nYakov Alpatych returns let us get away... and please don\'t...\"\n\n\"What is a trick?\" asked Princess Mary in surprise.\n\n\"I know it is, only listen to me for God\'s sake! Ask nurse too. They\nsay they don\'t agree to leave Bogucharovo as you ordered.\"\n\n\"You\'re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,\"\nsaid Princess Mary. \"Call Dronushka.\"\n\nDron came and confirmed Dunyasha\'s words; the peasants had come by\nthe princess\' order.\n\n\"But I never sent for them,\" declared the princess. \"You must have\ngiven my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the\ngrain.\"\n\nDron only sighed in reply.\n\n\"If you order it they will go away,\" said he.\n\n\"No, no. I\'ll go out to them,\" said Princess Mary, and in spite of\nthe nurse\'s and Dunyasha\'s protests she went out into the porch; Dron,\nDunyasha, the nurse, and Michael Ivanovich following her.\n\n\"They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to\nremain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the\nFrench,\" thought Princess Mary. \"I will offer them monthly rations and\nhousing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in\nmy place,\" she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the\ncrowd standing on the pasture by the barn.\n\nThe men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their\nhats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt,\ncame close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were\nfixed on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could\nnot distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them\nall at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she\nrepresented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she\nboldly began her speech.\n\n\"I am very glad you have come,\" she said without raising her eyes,\nand feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. \"Dronushka\ntells me that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune,\nand I shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because\nit is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving\nyou everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all\nour grain, so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been\ntold that I am giving you the grain to keep you here--that is not\ntrue. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our\nestate near Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there\nyou shall want for nothing. You shall be given food and lodging.\"\n\nThe princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.\n\n\"I am not doing this on my own account,\" she continued, \"I do it\nin the name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my\nbrother and his son.\"\n\nAgain she paused. No one broke the silence.\n\n\"Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that\nis mine is yours,\" she concluded, scanning the faces before her.\n\nAll eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She\ncould not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or\napprehension and distrust--but the expression on all the faces was\nidentical.\n\n\"We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won\'t do for us to\ntake the landlord\'s grain,\" said a voice at the back of the crowd.\n\n\"But why not?\" asked the princess.\n\nNo one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd,\nfound that every eye she met now was immediately dropped.\n\n\"But why don\'t you want to take it?\" she asked again.\n\nNo one answered.\n\nThe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch\nsomeone\'s eye.\n\n\"Why don\'t you speak?\" she inquired of a very old man who stood just\nin front of her leaning on his stick. \"If you think something more\nis wanted, tell me! I will do anything,\" said she, catching his eye.\n\nBut as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:\n\n\"Why should we agree? We don\'t want the grain.\"\n\n\"Why should we give up everything? We don\'t agree. Don\'t agree....\nWe are sorry for you, but we\'re not willing. Go away yourself,\nalone...\" came from various sides of the crowd.\n\nAnd again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical\nexpression, though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity\nor gratitude, but of angry resolve.\n\n\"But you can\'t have understood me,\" said Princess Mary with a sad\nsmile. \"Why don\'t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you,\nwhile here the enemy would ruin you...\"\n\nBut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.\n\n\"We\'re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won\'t take your grain. We\ndon\'t agree.\"\n\nAgain Princess Mary tried to catch someone\'s eye, but not a single\neye in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying\nto avoid her look. She felt strange and awkward.\n\n\"Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your\nhouses and go into bondage! I dare say! \'I\'ll give you grain, indeed!\'\nshe says,\" voices in the crowd were heard saying.\n\nWith drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the\nhouse. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for\nher departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone\nwith her own thoughts.');

She felt\nthat she could not understand them however much she might think\nabout them. She thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after\nthe break caused by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to\nthe past. Now she could remember it and weep or pray.\n\nAfter sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh.\nToward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full\nmoon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist\nbegan to rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.\n\nPictures of the near past--her father\'s illness and last moments--rose\none after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now\nlingered over these images, repelling with horror only the last one,\nthe picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate\neven in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these\npictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail\nthat they seemed now present, now past, and now future.\n\nShe vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was\nbeing dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,\nmuttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray\neyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.\n\n\"Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,\"\nshe thought. \"He had always thought what he said then.\" And she\nrecalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the\nlast stroke, when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at\nhome against his will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs\non tiptoe, and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept\nthat night had listened at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he\nwas saying something to Tikhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm\nnights and of the Empress. Evidently he had wanted to talk. \"And why\ndidn\'t he call me? Why didn\'t he let me be there instead of Tikhon?\"\nPrincess Mary had thought and thought again now. \"Now he will never\ntell anyone what he had in his soul. Never will that moment return for\nhim or for me when he might have said all he longed to say, and not\nTikhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn\'t I enter\nthe room?\" she thought. \"Perhaps he would then have said to me what he\nsaid the day he died. While talking to Tikhon he asked about me twice.\nHe wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door. It\nwas sad and painful for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand\nhim. I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were\nalive--he had forgotten she was dead--and Tikhon reminded him that she\nwas no more, and he shouted, \'Fool!\' He was greatly depressed. From\nbehind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly\nexclaimed, \'My God!\' Why didn\'t I go in then? What could he have\ndone to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps he would then have\nbeen comforted and would have said that word to me.\" And Princess Mary\nuttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of\nhis death. \"Dear-est!\" she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears\nthat relieved her soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the\nface she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen\nat a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first\ntime quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details, when she\nstooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.\n\n\"Dear-est!\" she repeated again.\n\n\"What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking\nnow?\" This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer\nshe saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as\nhe lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief.\nAnd the horror that had seized her when she touched him and\nconvinced herself that that was not he, but something mysterious and\nhorrible, seized her again. She tried to think of something else and\nto pray, but could do neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the\nmoonlight and the shadows, expecting every moment to see his dead\nface, and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within\nit held her fast.\n\n\"Dunyasha,\" she whispered. \"Dunyasha!\" she screamed wildly, and\ntearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants\'\nquarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running\ntoward her.');

On the way to\nBogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where\nthey hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they\nquestioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and\nraced one another to try Ilyin\'s horse.\n\nRostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property\nof that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister.\n\nRostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the\nincline before reaching Bogucharovo, and Rostov, outstripping Ilyin,\nwas the first to gallop into the village street.\n\n\"You\'re first!\" cried Ilyin, flushed.\n\n\"Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,\" answered Rostov,\nstroking his heated Donets horse.\n\n\"And I\'d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,\" said Lavrushka\nfrom behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, \"only I didn\'t wish to\nmortify you.\"\n\nThey rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants\nwas standing.\n\nSome of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals\nwithout doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled\nfaces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling,\nstaggering, and singing some incoherent song, and approached the\nofficers.\n\n\"Fine fellows!\" said Rostov laughing. \"Is there any hay here?\"\n\n\"And how like one another,\" said Ilyin.\n\n\"A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!\" sang one of the peasants with a\nblissful smile.\n\nOne of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov.\n\n\"Who do you belong to?\" he asked.\n\n\"The French,\" replied Ilyin jestingly, \"and here is Napoleon\nhimself\"--and he pointed to Lavrushka.\n\n\"Then you are Russians?\" the peasant asked again.\n\n\"And is there a large force of you here?\" said another, a short man,\ncoming up.\n\n\"Very large,\" answered Rostov. \"But why have you collected here?\" he\nadded. \"Is it a holiday?\"\n\n\"The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,\"\nreplied the peasant, moving away.\n\nAt that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women\nand a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.\n\n\"The one in pink is mine, so keep off!\" said Ilyin on seeing\nDunyasha running resolutely toward him.\n\n\"She\'ll be ours!\" said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking.\n\n\"What do you want, my pretty?\" said Ilyin with a smile.\n\n\"The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.\"\n\n\"This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am your humble\nservant.\"\n\n\"Co-o-om-pa-ny!\" roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as\nhe looked at Ilyin talking to the girl. Following Dunyasha, Alpatych\nadvanced to Rostov, having bared his head while still at a distance.\n\n\"May I make bold to trouble your honor?\" said he respectfully, but\nwith a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with\na hand thrust into his bosom. \"My mistress, daughter of General in\nChief Prince Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this\nmonth, finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of\nthese people\"--he pointed to the peasants--\"asks you to come up to the\nhouse.... Won\'t you, please, ride on a little farther,\" said\nAlpatych with a melancholy smile, \"as it is not convenient in the\npresence of...?\" He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to\nhim as horseflies to a horse.\n\n\"Ah!... Alpatych... Ah, Yakov Alpatych... Grand! Forgive us for\nChrist\'s sake, eh?\" said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.\n\nRostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.\n\n\"Or perhaps they amuse your honor?\" remarked Alpatych with a staid\nair, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.\n\n\"No, there\'s not much to be amused at here,\" said Rostov, and rode\non a little way. \"What\'s the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here\ndon\'t wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to\nunharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up\nsince morning, her excellency cannot get away.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed Rostov.\n\n\"I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,\" said Alpatych.\n\nRostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed\nAlpatych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs.\nIt appeared that the princess\' offer of corn to the peasants the\nprevious day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had\nactually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the\nkeys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent\nfor him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to\nharness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the\nbarn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that\nthere was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the\nhorses. Alpatych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was\nchiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the\ncrowd) that they could not let the princess go, that there was an\norder to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her\nas before and obey her in everything.\n\nAt the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road,\nPrincess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her nurse, and the\nmaids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the\ncavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran\naway, and the women in the house began to wail.\n\n\"Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!\" exclaimed deeply moved\nvoices as Rostov passed through the anteroom.\n\nPrincess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large\nsitting room, when Rostov was shown in. She could not grasp who he was\nand why he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his\nRussian face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered\nrecognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at him with\nher deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered\nand trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately struck Rostov as a\nromantic event. \"A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the\nmercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me\nhere! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and\nexpression!\" thought he as he looked at her and listened to her\ntimid story.\n\nWhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day\nafter her father\'s funeral, her voiced trembled. She turned away,\nand then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him\nto pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There\nwere tears in Rostov\'s eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced\ngratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of\nher face to be forgotten.\n\n\"I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride\nhere and am able to show my readiness to serve you,\" said Rostov,\nrising. \"Go when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no\none shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act\nas your escort.\" And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal\nblood, he moved toward the door.\n\nRostov\'s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would\nconsider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to\ntake advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.\n\nPrincess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.\n\n\"I am very, very grateful to you,\" she said in French, \"but I hope\nit was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.\" She\nsuddenly began to cry.\n\n\"Excuse me!\" she said.\n\nRostov, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.');

He saw that\nhis hero and commander was following quite a different train of\nthought.\n\nRostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with\nrapid steps to the village.\n\n\"I\'ll show them; I\'ll give it to them, the brigands!\" said he to\nhimself.\n\nAlpatych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up\nwith him with difficulty.\n\n\"What decision have you been pleased to come to?\" said he.\n\nRostov stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned\non Alpatych.\n\n\"Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...\" cried he. \"What have you\nbeen about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can\'t manage them?\nYou\'re a traitor yourself! I know you. I\'ll flay you all alive!...\"\nAnd as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpatych and\nwent rapidly forward. Alpatych, mastering his offended feelings,\nkept pace with Rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his\nviews. He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present\nmoment it would be imprudent to \"overresist\" them without an armed\nforce, and would it not be better first to send for the military?\n\n\"I\'ll give them armed force... I\'ll \'overresist\' them!\" uttered\nRostov meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the\nneed to vent it.\n\nWithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with\nquick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it\nthe more Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce\ngood results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed\nwhen they saw Rostov\'s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.\n\nAfter the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone to see\nthe princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among\nthe crowd. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were\nRussians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained.\nDron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and\nothers attacked their ex-Elder.\n\n\"How many years have you been fattening on the commune?\" Karp\nshouted at him. \"It\'s all one to you! You\'ll dig up your pot of\nmoney and take it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether\nour homes are ruined or not?\"\n\n\"We\'ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their\nhomes or take away a single grain, and that\'s all about it!\" cried\nanother.\n\n\"It was your son\'s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You\nbegrudged your lump of a son,\" a little old man suddenly began\nattacking Dron--\"and so they took my Vanka to be shaved for a soldier!\nBut we all have to die.\"\n\n\"To be sure, we all have to die. I\'m not against the commune,\"\nsaid Dron.\n\n\"That\'s it--not against it! You\'ve filled your belly....\"\n\nThe two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostov, followed\nby Ilyin, Lavrushka, and Alpatych, came up to the crowd, Karp,\nthrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to\nthe front. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew\ncloser together.\n\n\"Who is your Elder here? Hey?\" shouted Rostov, coming up to the\ncrowd with quick steps.\n\n\"The Elder? What do you want with him?...\" asked Karp.\n\nBut before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off\nand a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.\n\n\"Caps off, traitors!\" shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice. \"Where\'s\nthe Elder?\" he cried furiously.\n\n\"The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakharych, you!\" meek and\nflustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to\ncome off their heads.\n\n\"We don\'t riot, we\'re following the orders,\" declared Karp, and at\nthat moment several voices began speaking together.\n\n\"It\'s as the old men have decided--there\'s too many of you giving\norders.\"\n\n\"Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!\" cried Rostov unmeaningly\nin a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. \"Bind him, bind\nhim!\" he shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka\nand Alpatych.\n\nLavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from\nbehind.\n\n\"Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?\" he called out.\n\nAlpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to\ncome and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began\ntaking off their belts.\n\n\"Where\'s the Elder?\" demanded Rostov in a loud voice.\n\nWith a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.\n\n\"Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushka!\" shouted Rostov, as if that\norder, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.\n\nAnd in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his\nown belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.\n\n\"And you all listen to me!\" said Rostov to the peasants. \"Be off\nto your houses at once, and don\'t let one of your voices be heard!\"\n\n\"Why, we\'ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness.\nIt\'s all nonsense... I said then that it was not in order,\" voices\nwere heard bickering with one another.\n\n\"There! What did I say?\" said Alpatych, coming into his own again.\n\"It\'s wrong, lads!\"\n\n \"All our stupidity, Yakov Alpatych,\" came the answers, and the\ncrowd began at once to disperse through the village.\n\nThe two bound men were led off to the master\'s house. The two\ndrunken peasants followed them.\n\n\"Aye, when I look at you!...\" said one of them to Karp.\n\n\"How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking\nof, you fool?\" added the other--\"A real fool!\"\n\nTwo hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the\nBogucharovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the\nproprietor\'s goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron,\nliberated at Princess Mary\'s wish from the cupboard where he had\nbeen confined, was standing in the yard directing the men.\n\n\"Don\'t put it in so carelessly,\" said one of the peasants, a man\nwith a round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. \"You know\nit has cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under\nthe cord where it\'ll get rubbed? I don\'t like that way of doing\nthings. Let it all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put\nit under the bast matting and cover it with hay--that\'s the way!\"\n\n\"Eh, books, books!\" said another peasant, bringing out Prince\nAndrew\'s library cupboards. \"Don\'t catch up against it! It\'s heavy,\nlads--solid books.\"\n\n\"Yes, they worked all day and didn\'t play!\" remarked the tall,\nround-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the\ndictionaries that were on the top.\n\n\nUnwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostov did not go back\nto the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure.\nWhen her carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied\nher eight miles from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our\ntroops. At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave of her, for\nthe first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.\n\n\"How can you speak so!\" he blushingly replied to Princess Mary\'s\nexpressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had\noccurred. \"Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had\nonly peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,\"\nsaid he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. \"I am\nonly happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.\nGood-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to\nmeet you again in happier circumstances. If you don\'t want to make\nme blush, please don\'t thank me!\"\n\nBut the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him\nwith the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and\ntenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him\nfor. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been\nthere she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the\nFrench, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger\nto save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty\nand noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His\nkind, honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had\nbegun to cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.\n\nWhen she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt\nher eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the\nstrange question presented itself to her: did she love him?\n\nOn the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess\' position\nwas not a cheerful one, Dunyasha, who went with her in the carriage,\nmore than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window\nand smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.\n\n\"Well, supposing I do love him?\" thought Princess Mary.\n\nAshamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen\nin love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted\nherself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she\nwould not be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she\ncontinued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had\nfallen in love for the first and last time in her life.\n\nSometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his\nwords, happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those\nmoments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the\ncarriage window.\n\n\"Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo, and at that very\nmoment?\" thought Princess Mary. \"And that caused his sister to\nrefuse my brother?\" And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of\nProvidence.\n\nThe impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable one.\nTo remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of\nhis adventure at Bogucharovo, rallied him on having gone to look for\nhay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he\ngrew angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the\ngentle Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous\nfortune, had against his will more than once entered his head. For\nhimself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by\nmarrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be\nable to put his father\'s affairs in order, and would even--he felt\nit--ensure Princess Mary\'s happiness.\n\nBut Sonya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostov grew angry\nwhen he was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya.');

He stopped in the village at the priest\'s house in front of\nwhich stood the commander in chief\'s carriage, and he sat down on\nthe bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now\ncalled Kutuzov. From the field beyond the village came now sounds of\nregimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting \"Hurrah!\" to\nthe new commander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo,\nstood near by, some ten paces from Prince Andrew, availing\nthemselves of Kutuzov\'s absence and of the fine weather. A short,\nswarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and\nwhiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew,\ninquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and\nwhether he would soon be back.\n\nPrince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness\'\nstaff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned\nto a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a\ncommander in chief\'s orderly speaks to officers, replied:\n\n\"What? His Serene Highness? I expect he\'ll be here soon. What do you\nwant?\"\n\nThe lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the\norderly\'s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and\napproached Bolkonski with a slight bow. Bolkonski made room for him on\nthe bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.\n\n\"You\'re also waiting for the commander in chief?\" said he. \"They say\nhe weceives evewyone, thank God!... It\'s awful with those sausage\neaters! Ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now\np\'waps Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what\nwas happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in\nthe campaign?\" he asked.\n\n\"I had the pleasure,\" replied Prince Andrew, \"not only of taking\npart in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear--not\nto mention the estate and home of my birth--my father, who died of\ngrief. I belong to the province of Smolensk.\"\n\n\"Ah? You\'re Pwince Bolkonski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance!\nI\'m Lieutenant Colonel Denisov, better known as \'Vaska,\'\" said\nDenisov, pressing Prince Andrew\'s hand and looking into his face\nwith a particularly kindly attention. \"Yes, I heard,\" said he\nsympathetically, and after a short pause added: \"Yes, it\'s Scythian\nwarfare. It\'s all vewy well--only not for those who get it in the\nneck. So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkonski?\" He swayed his head. \"Vewy\npleased, Pwince, to make your acquaintance!\" he repeated again,\nsmiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince Andrew\'s hand.\n\nPrince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him of her\nfirst suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to\nthose painful feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which\nstill found place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and\nvery serious impressions--such as the retreat from Smolensk, his visit\nto Bald Hills, and the recent news of his father\'s death--and had\nexperienced so many emotions, that for a long time past those memories\nhad not entered his mind, and now that they did, they did not act on\nhim with nearly their former strength. For Denisov, too, the\nmemories awakened by the name of Bolkonski belonged to a distant,\nromantic past, when after supper and after Natasha\'s singing he had\nproposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was\ndoing. He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love\nfor Natasha, and passed at once to what now interested him\npassionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign he had\ndevised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had\nproposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to\nKutuzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line of\noperation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or\nconcurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the\nFrench, we should attack their line of communication. He began\nexplaining his plan to Prince Andrew.\n\n\"They can\'t hold all that line. It\'s impossible. I will undertake to\nbweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,\nthat\'s certain! There\'s only one way--guewilla warfare!\"\n\nDenisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to\nBolkonski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from\nthe army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with\nmusic and songs and coming from the field where the review was held.\nSounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.\n\n\"He\'s coming! He\'s coming!\" shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.\n\nBolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers\n(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutuzov coming down\nthe street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of\ngenerals rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and\na crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting, \"Hurrah!\"\n\nHis adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutuzov was\nimpatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his\nweight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard\'s cap with a\nred band and no peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to\nthe guard of honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing\ndecorations, who were giving him the salute, he looked at them\nsilently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a\ncommander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers\nsurrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression, he\nshrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.\n\n\"And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,\nGeneral,\" he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and\nDenisov.\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted those behind him.\n\nSince Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had grown still more\ncorpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and\nthe familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was\nwearing the white Horse Guard\'s cap and a military overcoat with a\nwhip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and\nswayed limply on his brisk little horse.\n\n\"Whew... whew... whew!\" he whistled just audibly as he rode into the\nyard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man\nwho means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the\nstirrup and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face\nwith the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned\non his knee, groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks\nand adjutants who stood ready to assist him.\n\nHe pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes,\nglanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved\nwith his waddling gait to the porch. \"Whew... whew... whew!\" he\nwhistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old\nmen, it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by\nPrince Andrew\'s face linked itself up with Kutuzov\'s remembrance of\nhis personality.\n\n\"Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come\nalong...\" said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the\nporch which creaked under his weight.\n\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.\n\n\"And how\'s your father?\"\n\n\"I received news of his death, yesterday,\" replied Prince Andrew\nabruptly.\n\nKutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then\ntook off his cap and crossed himself:\n\n\"May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God\'s will be done to us all!\" He\nsighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. \"I\nloved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my\nheart.\"\n\nHe embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for\nsome time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw\nthat Kutuzov\'s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his\neyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise\nhimself.\n\n\"Come! Come with me, we\'ll have a talk,\" said he.\n\nBut at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by his superiors\nthan by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch,\ndespite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him.\nKutuzov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly.\nDenisov, having given his name, announced that he had to communicate\nto his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their\ncountry\'s welfare. Kutuzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his\nhands with a gesture of annoyance, folded them across his stomach,\nrepeating the words: \"For our country\'s welfare? Well, what is it?\nSpeak!\" Denisov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see the color\nrise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly began to\nexpound his plan of cutting the enemy\'s lines of communication between\nSmolensk and Vyazma. Denisov came from those parts and knew the\ncountry well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from\nthe strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutuzov looked down at\nhis own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut\nas if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from\nthat hut, while Denisov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under\nhis arm really did appear.\n\n\"What?\" said Kutuzov, in the midst of Denisov\'s explanations, \"are\nyou ready so soon?\"\n\n\"Ready, your Serene Highness,\" replied the general.\n\nKutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: \"How is one man to\ndeal with it all?\" and again listened to Denisov.\n\n\"I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,\" said Denisov,\n\"that I can bweak Napoleon\'s line of communication!\"\n\n\"What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich\nDenisov?\" asked Kutuzov, interrupting him.\n\n\"He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.\"\n\n\"Ah, we were friends,\" said Kutuzov cheerfully. \"All right, all\nright, friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we\'ll have a talk.\"\n\nWith a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the\npapers Konovnitsyn had brought him.\n\n\"Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?\" said the\ngeneral on duty in a discontented voice, \"the plans must be examined\nand several papers have to be signed.\"\n\nAn adjutant came out and announced that everything was in\nreadiness within. But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that\nroom till he was disengaged. He made a grimace...\n\n\"No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I\'ll\nlook at them here,\" said he. \"Don\'t go away,\" he added, turning to\nPrince Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general\'s\nreport.\n\nWhile this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a\nwoman\'s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door.\nSeveral times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a\nplump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief\non her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the\ncommander in chief. Kutuzov\'s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew\nthat this was the wife of the priest whose home it was, and that she\nintended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt. \"Her husband has\nwelcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church, and she\nintends to welcome him in the house.... She\'s very pretty,\" added\nthe adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutuzov looked round. He was\nlistening to the general\'s report--which consisted chiefly of a\ncriticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zaymishche--as he had listened to\nDenisov, and seven years previously had listened to the discussion\nat the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only because\nhe had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them,\ncould not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general\ncould say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that\nwould be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to,\nas one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All\nthat Denisov had said was clever and to the point. What the general\nwas saying was even more clever and to the point, but it was evident\nthat Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness, and knew of\nsomething else that would decide the matter--something independent\nof cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the commander\nin chief\'s face attentively, and the only expression he could see\nthere was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the\nfeminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe\npropriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and\nlearning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but despised\nthem not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge--he\ndid not try to display any of these--but because of something else. He\ndespised them because of his old age and experience of life. The\nonly instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report\nreferred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report\nthe general put before him for signature a paper relating to the\nrecovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by\nthe soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation.\n\nAfter hearing the matter, Kutuzov smacked his lips together and\nshook his head.\n\n\"Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all,\nmy dear fellow,\" said he, \"into the fire with all such things! Let\nthem cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts\' content. I don\'t\norder it or allow it, but I don\'t exact compensation either. One can\'t\nget on without it. \'When wood is chopped the chips will fly.\'\" He\nlooked at the paper again. \"Oh, this German precision!\" he muttered,\nshaking his head.');

Thank you, sweetheart!\"\n\nHe took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the\ndish for her. \"Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?\" he asked,\nmoving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest\'s wife\nsmiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the\nroom. The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to\nlunch with him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to\nKutuzov. He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same\nunbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he\nclosed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife.\nPrince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne\nby Madame de Genlis.\n\n\"Well, sit down, sit down here. Let\'s have a talk,\" said Kutuzov.\n\"It\'s sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a\nfather to you, a second father....\"\n\nPrince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of his father\'s death, and\nwhat he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.\n\n\"What... what they have brought us to!\" Kutuzov suddenly cried in an\nagitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince\nAndrew\'s story the condition Russia was in. \"But give me time, give me\ntime!\" he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue\nthis agitating conversation, and added: \"I sent for you to keep you\nwith me.\"\n\n\"I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the\nstaff,\" replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutuzov noticed.\n\nKutuzov glanced inquiringly at him.\n\n\"But above all,\" added Prince Andrew, \"I have grown used to my\nregiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I\nshould be sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being\nwith you, believe me...\"\n\nA shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutuzov\'s\npodgy face. He cut Bolkonski short.\n\n\"I am sorry, for I need you. But you\'re right, you\'re right! It\'s\nnot here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men\nare not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be\nadvisers served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I\nremember, yes, I remember you with the standard!\" said Kutuzov, and\na flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew\'s face at this\nrecollection.\n\nTaking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutuzov offered his cheek\nto be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man\'s\neyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutuzov\'s tears came easily,\nand that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a\nwish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz\nwas both pleasant and flattering to him.\n\n\"Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of\nhonor!\" He paused. \"I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to\nsend.\" And changing the subject, Kutuzov began to speak of the Turkish\nwar and the peace that had been concluded. \"Yes, I have been much\nblamed,\" he said, \"both for that war and the peace... but everything\ncame at the right time. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre.*\nAnd there were as many advisers there as here...\" he went on,\nreturning to the subject of \"advisers\" which evidently occupied him.\n\"Ah, those advisers!\" said he. \"If we had listened to them all we\nshould not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been\nthrough with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less\nspeed. Kamenski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed\nfortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture\na fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not storming\nand attacking but patience and time are wanted. Kamenski sent soldiers\nto Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more\nfortresses than Kamenski and made them Turks eat horseflesh!\" He swayed\nhis head. \"And the French shall too, believe me,\" he went on,\ngrowing warmer and beating his chest, \"I\'ll make them eat horseflesh!\"\nAnd tears again dimmed his eyes.\n\n\n*\"Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.\"\n\n\n\"But shan\'t we have to accept battle?\" remarked Prince Andrew.\n\n\"We shall if everybody wants it; it can\'t be helped.... But\nbelieve me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two:\npatience and time, they will do it all. But the advisers n\'entendent\npas de cette oreille, voila le mal.* Some want a thing--others\ndon\'t. What\'s one to do?\" he asked, evidently expecting an answer.\n\"Well, what do you want us to do?\" he repeated and his eye shone\nwith a deep, shrewd look. \"I\'ll tell you what to do,\" he continued, as\nPrince Andrew still did not reply: \"I will tell you what to do, and\nwhat I do. Dans le doute, mon cher,\" he paused, \"abstiens-toi\"*[2]--he\narticulated the French proverb deliberately.\n\n\n*\"Don\'t see it that way, that\'s the trouble.\"\n\n*[2] \"When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.\"\n\n\n\"Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I\nshare your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor\na prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything\ncome straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\"\n\nAgain he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter\nhad left the room Kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his\nunfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.\n\nPrince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but\nafter that interview with Kutuzov he went back to his regiment\nreassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to\nwhom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all\npersonal motive in that old man--in whom there seemed to remain only\nthe habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events\nand drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the\ncourse of events--the more reassured he was that everything would be\nas it should. \"He will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not\ndevise or undertake anything,\" thought Prince Andrew, \"but he will\nhear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place.\nHe will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He\nunderstands that there is something stronger and more important than\nhis own will--the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and\ngrasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain\nfrom meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something\nelse. And above all,\" thought Prince Andrew, \"one believes in him\nbecause he\'s Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French\nproverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: \'What they have\nbrought us to!\' and had a sob in it when he said he would \'make them\neat horseflesh!\'\"\n\nOn such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity\nand general approval were founded with which, despite court\ninfluences, the popular choice of Kutuzov as commander in chief was\nreceived.');

The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor\neveryone had displayed during the Emperor\'s stay was the call for\ncontributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the\npromises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became\nunavoidable.\n\nWith the enemy\'s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites\' view of their\nsituation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even\nmore frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger\napproaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices\nthat speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably\ntells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of\nescaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too\ndepressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in\nman\'s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of\nevents, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till\nit comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man\ngenerally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So\nit was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people\nhad been as gay in Moscow as that year.\n\nRostopchin\'s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a\npotman, and a Moscow burgher called Karpushka Chigirin, \"who--having\nbeen a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub--heard\nthat Napoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the\nFrench in very bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under\nthe sign of the eagle, began to address the assembled people,\" were\nread and discussed, together with the latest of Vasili Lvovich\nPushkin\'s bouts rimes.\n\nIn the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these\nbroadsheets, and some liked the way Karpushka jeered at the French,\nsaying: \"They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our\nbuckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are\nall dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a\nhayfork.\" Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and\nvulgar. It was said that Rostopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and\neven all foreigners from Moscow, and that there had been some spies\nand agents of Napoleon among them; but this was told chiefly to\nintroduce Rostopchin\'s witty remark on that occasion. The foreigners\nwere deported to Nizhni by boat, and Rostopchin had said to them in\nFrench: \"Rentrez en vousmemes; entrez dans la barque, et n\'en faites\npas une barque de Charon.\"* There was talk of all the government\noffices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this\nShinshin\'s witticism was added--that for that alone Moscow ought to be\ngrateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamonov\'s regiment would cost\nhim eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezukhov had spent even\nmore on his, but that the best thing about Bezukhov\'s action was\nthat he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his\nregiment without charging anything for the show.\n\n\n*\"Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to make it a\nbarque of Charon.\"\n\n\n\"You don\'t spare anyone,\" said Julie Drubetskaya as she collected\nand pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed\nfingers.\n\nJulie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a\nfarewell soiree.\n\n\"Bezukhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What\npleasure is there to be so caustique?\"\n\n\"A forfeit!\" cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie\ncalled \"mon chevalier,\" and who was going with her to Nizhni.\n\nIn Julie\'s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been\nagreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who\nmade a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of\nVoluntary Contributions.\n\n\"Another forfeit for a Gallicism,\" said a Russian writer who was\npresent. \"\'What pleasure is there to be\' is not Russian!\"\n\n\"You spare no one,\" continued Julie to the young man without heeding\nthe author\'s remark.\n\n\"For caustique--I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay\nagain for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I\nwon\'t be responsible,\" she remarked, turning to the author: \"I have\nneither the money nor the time, like Prince Galitsyn, to engage a\nmaster to teach me Russian!\"\n\n\"Ah, here he is!\" she added. \"Quand on... No, no,\" she said to the\nmilitia officer, \"you won\'t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its\nrays!\" and she smiled amiably at Pierre. \"We were just talking of\nyou,\" she said with the facility in lying natural to a society\nwoman. \"We were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better\nthan Mamonov\'s.\"\n\n\"Oh, don\'t talk to me of my regiment,\" replied Pierre, kissing his\nhostess\' hand and taking a seat beside her. \"I am so sick of it.\"\n\n\"You will, of course, command it yourself?\" said Julie, directing\na sly, sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.\n\nThe latter in Pierre\'s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his\nface expressed perplexity as to what Julie\'s smile might mean. In\nspite of his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre\'s personality\nimmediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.\n\n\"No,\" said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. \"I\nshould make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I\nshould hardly be able to climb onto a horse.\"\n\nAmong those whom Julie\'s guests happened to choose to gossip about\nwere the Rostovs.\n\n\"I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,\" said Julie.\n\"And he is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean.

What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is\ngoing: and besides--I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.\"\n\n\"If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off\nall his debts,\" said the militia officer, speaking of Rostov.\n\n\"A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so\nlong in Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago.\nNatalie is quite well again now, isn\'t she?\" Julie asked Pierre with a\nknowing smile.\n\n\"They are waiting for their younger son,\" Pierre replied. \"He joined\nObolenski\'s Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment\nis being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my\nregiment and are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave\nlong ago, but the countess won\'t on any account leave Moscow till\nher son returns.\"\n\n\"I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkharovs\'.

What do you mean?\" demanded Pierre, blushing.\n\n\"Oh, come, my dear count! C\'est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous\nadmire, ma parole d\'honneur!\"*\n\n\n*\"It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!\"\n\n\n\"Forfeit, forfeit!\" cried the militia officer.\n\n\"All right, one can\'t talk--how tiresome!\"\n\n\"What is \'the talk of all Moscow\'?\" Pierre asked angrily, rising\nto his feet.\n\n\"Come now, Count, you know!\"\n\n\"I don\'t know anything about it,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always\nmore friendly with Vera--that dear Vera.\"\n\n\"No, madame!\" Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, \"I have not\ntaken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova\'s knight at all, and\nhave not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot\nunderstand the cruelty...\"\n\n\"Qui s\'excuse s\'accuse,\"* said Julie, smiling and waving the lint\ntriumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the\nsubject. \"Do you know what I heard today?

The second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at\nVyazma, that Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as\nmany of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were\nready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which\ncould be had at a low price. The tone of the proclamation was not as\njocose as in the former Chigirin talks. Pierre pondered over these\nbroadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the\nwhole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in\nhim was drawing near.\n\n\"Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?\" he asked\nhimself for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on\nthe table and began to lay them out for a game of patience.\n\n\"If this patience comes out,\" he said to himself after shuffling the\ncards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, \"if it comes\nout, it means... what does it mean?\"\n\nHe had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of\nthe eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.\n\n\"Then it will mean that I must go to the army,\" said Pierre to\nhimself. \"Come in, come in!\" he added to the princess.\n\nOnly the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long\nwaist, was still living in Pierre\'s house. The two younger ones had\nboth married.\n\n\"Excuse my coming to you, cousin,\" she said in a reproachful and\nagitated voice. \"You know some decision must be come to. What is going\nto happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is\nit that we are staying on?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,\" said Pierre\nin the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling\nuncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.\n\n\"Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivanovna told me\ntoday how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly\ndoes them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous--they no\nlonger obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they\nwill soon begin beating us. One can\'t walk in the streets. But,\nabove all, the French will be here any day now, so what are we waiting\nfor? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,\" she went on, \"arrange for\nme to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can\'t live under\nBonaparte\'s rule.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On\nthe contrary...\"\n\n\"I won\'t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If\nyou don\'t want to do this...\"\n\n\"But I will, I\'ll give the order at once.\"\n\nThe princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry\nwith. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.\n\n\"But you have been misinformed,\" said Pierre. \"Everything is quiet\nin the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I\'ve just been\nreading...\" He showed her the broadsheet. \"Count Rostopchin writes\nthat he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter\nMoscow.\"\n\n\"Oh, that count of yours!\" said the princess malevolently. \"He is\na hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot.\nDidn\'t he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, \'whoever\nit might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair\'? (How\nsilly!) \'And honor and glory to whoever captures him,\' he says. This\nis what his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Ivanovna told me the\nmob near killed her because she said something in French.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it\'s so... You take everything so to heart,\" said Pierre,\nand began laying out his cards for patience.\n\nAlthough that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,\nbut remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,\nirresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting\nsomething terrible.\n\nNext day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre\'s head\nsteward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment\nof his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates.\nIn general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of\nraising a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely\nable to repress a smile.\n\n\"Well then, sell it,\" said he. \"What\'s to be done? I can\'t draw back\nnow!\"\n\nThe worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the\nbetter was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the\ncatastrophe he expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was\nleft in town. Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his\nintimate friends only the Rostovs remained, but he did not go to see\nthem.\n\nTo distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of\nVorontsovo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to\ndestroy the foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The\nballoon was not yet ready, but Pierre learned that it was being\nconstructed by the Emperor\'s desire. The Emperor had written to\nCount Rostopchin as follows:\n\n\nAs soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and\nintelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutuzov to\nlet him know. I have informed him of the matter.\n\nPlease impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for\nthe first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the\nenemy\'s hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with\nthose of the commander in chief.\n\n\nOn his way home from Vorontsovo, as he was passing the Bolotnoe\nPlace Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lobnoe Place, stopped and\ngot out of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being\nflogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was\nreleasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in\nblue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously.\nAnother criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their faces\nthey were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering look\nresembling that on the thin Frenchman\'s face, Pierre pushed his way in\nthrough the crowd.\n\n\"What is it? Who is it? What is it for?\" he kept asking.\n\nBut the attention of the crowd--officials, burghers, shopkeepers,\npeasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses--was so eagerly centered\non what was passing in Lobnoe Place that no one answered him. The\nstout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently\ntrying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking\nabout him, but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in\nthe way full-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for\ndoing so. In the crowd people began talking loudly, to stifle their\nfeelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.\n\n\"He\'s cook to some prince.\"\n\n\"Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets\nhis teeth on edge!\" said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind\nPierre, when the Frenchman began to cry.\n\nThe clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be\nappreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch\nin dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.\n\nPierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went\nback to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took\nhis seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times\nso audibly that the coachman asked him:\n\n\"What is your pleasure?\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to\nLubyanka Street.\n\n\"To the Governor\'s, as you ordered,\" answered the coachman.\n\n\"Fool! Idiot!\" shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman--a thing he\nrarely did. \"Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!\" \"I must\nget away this very day,\" he murmured to himself.\n\nAt the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the\nLobnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he\ncould no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that\nvery day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman\nthis or that the man ought to have known it for himself.\n\nOn reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey--his head coachman who\nknew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow--that\nhe would leave that night for the army at Mozhaysk, and that his\nsaddle horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged\nthat day, so on Evstafey\'s representation Pierre had to put off his\ndeparture till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent\non in advance.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain,\nand after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night\nin Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that\nevening. (This was the battle of Shevardino.) He was told that there\nin Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could\nanswer his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was\napproaching Mozhaysk.\n\nEvery house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the\nhostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no\nroom to be had. It was full of officers.\n\nEverywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on\nthe march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and\ncannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and\nthe farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into\nthat sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation\nand a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a\nfeeling akin to what he had felt at the Sloboda Palace during the\nEmperor\'s visit--a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and\nsacrificing something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that\neverything that constitutes men\'s happiness--the comforts of life,\nwealth, even life itself--is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away,\ncompared with something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did\nnot try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular\ndelight in sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the\nquestion of what to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself\nafforded him a new and joyous sensation.');

Why was the battle of Borodino fought? There was not the\nleast sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate\nresult for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought\nnearer to the destruction of Moscow--which we feared more than\nanything in the world; and for the French its immediate result was\nthat they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole\narmy--which they feared more than anything in the world. What the\nresult must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kutuzov\naccepted that battle.\n\nIf the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it\nmust have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen\nhundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter\nof his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have\nbeen equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the\nloss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For\nKutuzov this was mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing\ndraughts I have one man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly\nlose, and therefore should not exchange. When my opponent has\nsixteen men and I have fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than\nhe, but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times\nas strong as I am.\n\nBefore the battle of Borodino our strength in proportion to the\nFrench was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little\nmore than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a\nhundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty\nthousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced\nKutuzov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a\ncommander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of his army and\nlengthening his lines of communication still more. If it is said\nthat he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow as he had\nended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much\nevidence to the contrary. Napoleon\'s historians themselves tell us\nthat from Smolensk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his\nextended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be\nthe end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smolensk the state in\nwhich Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single\nreply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.\n\nIn giving and accepting battle at Borodino, Kutuzov acted\ninvoluntarily and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had\noccurred, the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the\nforesight and genius of the generals who, of all the blind tools of\nhistory were the most enslaved and involuntary.\n\nThe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes\nfurnish the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to\naccustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that\nkind are meaningless.\n\nOn the other question, how the battle of Borodino and the\npreceding battle of Shevardino were fought, there also exists a\ndefinite and well-known, but quite false, conception. All the\nhistorians describe the affair as follows:\n\nThe Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolensk sought\nout for itself the best position for a general engagement and found\nsuch a position at Borodino.\n\nThe Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the\nleft of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolensk) and almost at a right\nangle to it, from Borodino to Utitsa, at the very place where the\nbattle was fought.\n\nIn front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set\nup on the Shevardino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth,\nwe are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on\nthe twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in\nposition on the field of Borodino.\n\nSo the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares\nto look into the matter can easily convince himself.\n\nThe Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the\ncontrary, during the retreat passed many positions better than\nBorodino. They did not stop at any one of these positions because\nKutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen,\nbecause the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself\nstrongly enough, and because Miloradovich had not yet arrived with the\nmilitia, and for many other reasons. The fact is that other\npositions they had passed were stronger, and that the position at\nBorodino (the one where the battle was fought), far from being strong,\nwas no more a position than any other spot one might find in the\nRussian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.\n\nNot only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of\nBorodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that\nis, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the\ntwenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be\nfought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no\nentrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the\ntwenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the\nposition of the Shevardino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless\nin front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it\nmore strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all\nefforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till\nlate at night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have\nsufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position\non which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the\nShevardino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we\nhave the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and\nBagration were convinced that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left\nflank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself in his report, written\nin hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevardino Redoubt as the\nleft flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on the\nbattle of Borodino were written at leisure, that the incorrect and\nextraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes\nof a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible)\nthat the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post--whereas in reality\nit was simply a fortified point on the left flank--and that the battle\nof Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously\nselected, where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which\nwas almost unentrenched.\n\nThe case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river\nKolocha--which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an\nacute angle--so that the left flank was at Shevardino, the right flank\nnear the village of Novoe, and the center at Borodino at the\nconfluence of the rivers Kolocha and Voyna.\n\nTo anyone who looks at the field of Borodino without thinking of how\nthe battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the\nriver Kolocha, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was\nto prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolensk road to Moscow.\n\nNapoleon, riding to Valuevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as\nthe history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utitsa\nto Borodino (he could not have seen that position because it did not\nexist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while\npursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the\nRussian position--at the Shevardino Redoubt--and unexpectedly for\nthe Russians moved his army across the Kolocha. And the Russians,\nnot having time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left\nwing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new\nposition which had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By\ncrossing to the other side of the Kolocha to the left of the highroad,\nNapoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left\n(looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the plain\nbetween Utitsa, Semenovsk, and Borodino--a plain no more\nadvantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia--and there\nthe whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place.\n\nHad Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the\nKolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the\nredoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have\ndoubted that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of our\nposition, and the battle would have taken place where we expected it.\nIn that case we should probably have defended the Shevardino\nRedoubt--our left flank--still more obstinately. We should have\nattacked Napoleon in the center or on the right, and the engagement\nwould have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in the position we\nintended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank took\nplace in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard (that is,\nimmediately after the fight at Gridneva), and as the Russian\ncommanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general\nengagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and\nchief action of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the\ntwenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the\ntwenty-sixth.\n\nAfter the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found ourselves on\nthe morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank,\nand were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it\nchanced to be.\n\nNot only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by\nweak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that\nposition was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders--not\nhaving fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of our\nposition on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of\nthe forthcoming battle from right to left--maintained their extended\nposition from the village of Novoe to Utitsa, and consequently had\nto move their forces from right to left during the battle. So it\nhappened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the\nentire French army launched against our left flank with but half as\nmany men. (Poniatowski\'s action against Utitsa, and Uvarov\'s on the\nright flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main\ncourse of the battle.) So the battle of Borodino did not take place at\nall as (in an effort to conceal our commanders\' mistakes even at the\ncost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it\nhas been described. The battle of Borodino was not fought on a\nchosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than\nthose of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shevardino\nRedoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodino on an open and\nalmost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the\nFrench; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely\nunthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result,\nbut unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration\nand flight.');

At\nthe descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led\nout of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was\nbeing held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle\nand proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down\nthe hill preceded by its singers. Coming up toward him was a train\nof carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day\nbefore. The peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept\ncrossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which three or\nfour wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted over the stones\nthat had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like\na road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks,\ncompressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the\ncarts as they were jolted against one another. Almost all of them\nstared with naive, childlike curiosity at Pierre\'s white hat and green\nswallow-tail coat.\n\nPierre\'s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep\nto one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the\nhill with its singers, surrounded Pierre\'s carriage and blocked the\nroad. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in\nwhich the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not\npenetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above\nPierre\'s head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded\nmerrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road\nclose to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it,\nplaced a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began\narranging the breech-band on his little horse.\n\nOne of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was\nfollowing the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand\nand turned to look at Pierre.\n\n\"I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us\non to Moscow?\" he asked.\n\nPierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question.\nHe was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy\nof wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two\nwounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in\nthe cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was\nwrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby\'s\nhead. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was\nlooking at the cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a\nfair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his\nthin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third\nlay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry singers were\npassing close by:\n\n   Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,\n   Living in a foreign land.\n\nthey sang their soldiers\' dance song.\n\nAs if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the\nmetallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays\nof the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another\nsort of merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded\nnear the panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber,\nand sad.\n\nThe soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry\nsingers.\n\n\"Oh, the coxcombs!\" he muttered reproachfully.\n\n\"It\'s not the soldiers only, but I\'ve seen peasants today, too....\nThe peasants--even they have to go,\" said the soldier behind the cart,\naddressing Pierre with a sad smile. \"No distinctions made nowadays....\nThey want the whole nation to fall on them--in a word, it\'s Moscow!\nThey want to make an end of it.\"\n\nIn spite of the obscurity of the soldier\'s words Pierre understood\nwhat he wanted to say and nodded approval.\n\nThe road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.\n\nHe kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but\nonly saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of\ndifferent branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at\nhis white hat and green tail coat.\n\nHaving gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and\neagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was\ndriving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young\nsurgeon, and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied\nthe driver\'s seat to pull up.\n\n\"Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Well, you know, I wanted to see...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, there will be something to see....\"\n\nPierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of\ntaking part in a battle.\n\nThe doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov.\n\n\"Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?\"\nhe said, exchanging glances with his young companion. \"Anyhow his\nSerene Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That\'s what\nyou must do.\"\n\nThe doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.\n\n\"You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is\nexactly?\" said Pierre.\n\n\"The position?\" repeated the doctor. \"Well, that\'s not my line.\nDrive past Tatarinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the\nhillock and you\'ll see.\"\n\n\"Can one see from there?... If you would...\"\n\nBut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.\n\n\"I would go with you but on my honor I\'m up to here\"--and he pointed\nto his throat. \"I\'m galloping to the commander of the corps. How do\nmatters stand?... You know, Count, there\'ll be a battle tomorrow.\nOut of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty\nthousand wounded, and we haven\'t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or\ndoctors enough for six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we\nneed other things as well--we must manage as best we can!\"\n\nThe strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who\nhad stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had\nnoticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death\namazed Pierre.\n\n\"They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but\ndeath?\" And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the\nMozhaysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the\nslanting rays of the sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly\nrecurred to his mind.\n\n\"The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a\nmoment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded.\nYet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they\nwonder at my hat! Strange!\" thought Pierre, continuing his way to\nTatarinova.\n\nIn front of a landowner\'s house to the left of the road stood\ncarriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The\ncommander in chief was putting up there, but just when Pierre\narrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there--they had\ngone to the church service. Pierre drove on toward Gorki.\n\nWhen he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street,\nhe saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and\nwith crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated\nand perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to\nthe right of the road.\n\nSome of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth\nalong planks, while others stood about doing nothing.\n\nTwo officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On\nseeing these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the\nnovelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the\nwounded men at Mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when\nhe said: \"They want the whole nation to fall on them.\" The sight of\nthese bearded peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer,\nclumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the\nleft toward the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned\ncollarbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and\nimportance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard.');

The sun shone somewhat to the left\nand behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising\nlike an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied\natmosphere.\n\nFrom above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the\nSmolensk highroad, passing through a village with a white church\nsome five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was\nBorodino. Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge\nand, winding down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of\nValuevo visible about four miles away, where Napoleon was then\nstationed. Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest\non the horizon. Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to\nthe right of the road, the cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery\ngleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue\nexpanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking\ncampfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops--ours and\nthe enemy\'s. The ground to the right--along the course of the\nKolocha and Moskva rivers--was broken and hilly. Between the hollows\nthe villages of Bezubova and Zakharino showed in the distance. On\nthe left the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and\nthe smoking ruins of Semenovsk, which had been burned down, could be\nseen.\n\nAll that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor\nthe right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations.\nNowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only\nfields, meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages,\nmounds, and streams; and try as he would he could descry no military\n\"position\" in this place which teemed with life, nor could he even\ndistinguish our troops from the enemy\'s.\n\n\"I must ask someone who knows,\" he thought, and addressed an officer\nwho was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.\n\n\"May I ask you,\" said Pierre, \"what village that is in front?\"\n\n\"Burdino, isn\'t it?\" said the officer, turning to his companion.\n\n\"Borodino,\" the other corrected him.\n\nThe officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up\nto Pierre.\n\n\"Are those our men there?\" Pierre inquired.\n\n\"Yes, and there, further on, are the French,\" said the officer.\n\"There they are, there... you can see them.\"\n\n\"Where? Where?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!\"\n\nThe officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left\nbeyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that\nPierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.\n\n\"Ah, those are the French! And over there?...\" Pierre pointed to a\nknoll on the left, near which some troops could be seen.\n\n\"Those are ours.\"\n\n\"Ah, ours! And there?...\" Pierre pointed to another knoll in the\ndistance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow\nwhere also some campfires were smoking and something black was\nvisible.\n\n\"That\'s his again,\" said the officer. (It was the Shevardino\nRedoubt.) \"It was ours yesterday, but now it is his.\"\n\n\"Then how about our position?\"\n\n\"Our position?\" replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. \"I\ncan tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our\nentrenchments. There, you see? There\'s our center, at Borodino, just\nthere,\" and he pointed to the village in front of them with the\nwhite church. \"That\'s where one crosses the Kolocha. You see down\nthere where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there\'s the\nbridge. That\'s our center. Our right flank is over there\"--he\npointed sharply to the right, far away in the broken ground--\"That\'s\nwhere the Moskva River is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there,\nvery strong ones. The left flank...\" here the officer paused. \"Well,\nyou see, that\'s difficult to explain.... Yesterday our left flank\nwas there at Shevardino, you see, where the oak is, but now we have\nwithdrawn our left wing--now it is over there, do you see that village\nand the smoke? That\'s Semenovsk, yes, there,\" he pointed to\nRaevski\'s knoll. \"But the battle will hardly be there. His having\nmoved his troops there is only a ruse; he will probably pass round\nto the right of the Moskva. But wherever it may be, many a man will be\nmissing tomorrow!\" he remarked.\n\nAn elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was\ngiving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish\nspeaking, but at this point, evidently not liking the officer\'s\nremark, interrupted him.\n\n\"Gabions must be sent for,\" said he sternly.\n\nThe officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might\nthink of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak\nof it.\n\n\"Well, send number three company again,\" the officer replied\nhurriedly.\n\n\"And you, are you one of the doctors?\"\n\n\"No, I\'ve come on my own,\" answered Pierre, and he went down the\nhill again, passing the militiamen.\n\n\"Oh, those damned fellows!\" muttered the officer who followed him,\nholding his nose as he ran past the men at work.\n\n\"There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They\'ll\nbe here in a minute...\" voices were suddenly heard saying; and\nofficers, soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the\nroad.\n\nA church procession was coming up the hill from Borodino. First\nalong the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with\narms reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.\n\nSoldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the\nprocession.\n\n\"They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of\nGod!\" someone cried.\n\n\"The Smolensk Mother of God,\" another corrected him.\n\nThe militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who\nhad been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to\nmeet the church procession. Following the battalion that marched along\nthe dusty road came priests in their vestments--one little old man in\na hood with attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers\nbore a large, dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was\nthe icon that had been brought from Smolensk and had since accompanied\nthe army. Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with\nbared heads walked, ran, and bowed to the ground.\n\nAt the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had\nbeen holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by\nothers, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot\nrays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with\nthe hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.\nThe singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of\nbareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.\nBehind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot\nreserved for them. A bald general with a St. George\'s Cross on his\nneck stood just behind the priest\'s back, and without crossing himself\n(he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service,\nwhich he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to\narouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in\na martial pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his\nchest while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants,\nPierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did\nnot look at them--his whole attention was absorbed in watching the\nserious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and\nmilitiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the\ntired chanters, who were singing the service for the twentieth time\nthat day, began lazily and mechanically to sing: \"Save from calamity\nThy servants, O Mother of God,\" and the priest and deacon chimed in:\n\"For to Thee under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and\nprotection,\" there again kindled in all those faces the same\nexpression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment\nthat Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozhaysk\nand momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and\nheads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and\nthe sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.\n\nThe crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.\nSomeone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which\nway was made for him, was approaching the icon.\n\nIt was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the position and on his\nway back to Tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held.\nPierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which\ndistinguished him from everybody else.\n\nWith a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,\nwith uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the\neye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the\ncrowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an\naccustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand,\nand bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutuzov was\nBennigsen and the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in\nchief, who attracted the attention of all the superior officers, the\nmilitiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at\nhim.\n\nWhen the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, sank\nheavily to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried\nvainly to rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and\nweight. His white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose,\nkissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips, and again\nbowed till he touched the ground with his hand. The other generals\nfollowed his example, then the officers, and after them with excited\nfaces, pressing on one another, crowding, panting, and pushing,\nscrambled the soldiers and militiamen.');

How did you get here?\" said a voice.\n\nPierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees with his\nhand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the\nicon), came up to him smiling. Boris was elegantly dressed, with a\nslightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long\ncoat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.\n\nMeanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in\nthe shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run\nto fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and\nbrilliant suite surrounded him.\n\nThe icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre\nstopped some thirty paces from Kutuzov, talking to Boris.\n\nHe explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the\nposition.\n\n\"This is what you must do,\" said Boris. \"I will do the honors of the\ncamp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen\nwill be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I\'ll mention it to\nhim. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us.\nWe are just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend\nthe night with me and we\'ll arrange a game of cards. Of course you\nknow Dmitri Sergeevich? Those are his quarters,\" and he pointed to the\nthird house in the village of Gorki.\n\n\"But I should like to see the right flank. They say it\'s very\nstrong,\" said Pierre. \"I should like to start from the Moskva River\nand ride round the whole position.\"\n\n\"Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left\nflank.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski\'s regiment? Can you point\nit out to me?\"\n\n\"Prince Andrew\'s? We shall pass it and I\'ll take you to him.\"\n\n\"What about the left flank?\" asked Pierre\n\n\"To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state\nour left flank is in,\" said Boris confidentially lowering his voice.\n\"It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify\nthat knoll quite differently, but...\" Boris shrugged his shoulders,\n\"his Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him.\nYou see...\" but Boris did not finish, for at that moment Kaysarov,\nKutuzov\'s adjutant, came up to Pierre. \"Ah, Kaysarov!\" said Boris,\naddressing him with an unembarrassed smile, \"I was just trying to\nexplain our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene\nHighness could so foresee the intentions of the French!\"\n\n\"You mean the left flank?\" asked Kaysarov.\n\n\"Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.\"\n\nThough Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff,\nBoris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He\nhad established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom\nBoris had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskoy an\ninvaluable man.\n\nIn the higher command there were two sharply defined parties:\nKutuzov\'s party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris\nbelonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile\nrespect to Kutuzov, could so create an impression that the old\nfellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now\nthe decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed\nand the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov won the battle\nit would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case\nmany great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow\'s action, and\nnew men would come to the front. So Boris was full of nervous vivacity\nall day.\n\nAfter Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had\nnot time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered\nupon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all\nexpressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the\ncause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in\nquestions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by\nthe different expression he saw on other faces--an expression that\nspoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life\nand death. Kutuzov noticed Pierre\'s figure and the group gathered\nround him.\n\n\"Call him to me,\" said Kutuzov.\n\nAn adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness\' wish, and Pierre\nwent toward Kutuzov\'s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It\nwas Dolokhov.\n\n\"How did that fellow get here?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"He\'s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!\" was the answer. \"He has\nbeen degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He\'s been\nproposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy\'s picket\nline at night.... He\'s a brave fellow.\"\n\nPierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov.\n\n\"I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might\nsend me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I\nshouldn\'t lose anything...\" Dolokhov was saying.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my\nFatherland for which I am ready to die.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare\nhis skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your\nSerene Highness.\"\n\n\"Yes... Yes...\" Kutuzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more\nand more as he looked at Pierre.\n\nJust then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to\nPierre\'s side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner, without\nraising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted\nconversation:\n\n\"The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What\nheroism, Count!\"\n\nBoris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by\nhis Serene Highness. He knew Kutuzov\'s attention would be caught by\nthose words, and so it was.\n\n\"What are you saying about the militia?\" he asked Boris.\n\n\"Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness--for death--they\nhave put on clean shirts.\"\n\n\"Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!\" said Kutuzov; and he closed\nhis eyes and swayed his head. \"A matchless people!\" he repeated with a\nsigh.\n\n\"So you want to smell gunpowder?\" he said to Pierre. \"Yes, it\'s a\npleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife\'s adorers.\nIs she well? My quarters are at your service.\"\n\nAnd as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began looking about\nabsent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.\n\nThen, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew\nKaysarov, his adjutant\'s brother.\n\n\"Those verses... those verses of Marin\'s... how do they go, eh?\nThose he wrote about Gerakov: \'Lectures for the corps inditing\'...\nRecite them, recite them!\" said he, evidently preparing to laugh.\n\nKaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm\nof the verses.\n\nWhen Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and took his\nhand.\n\n\"I am very glad to meet you here, Count,\" he said aloud,\nregardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute\nand solemn tone. \"On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us\nis fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that\nI regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should\nwish you not to have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.\"\n\nPierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to\nhim. With tears in his eyes Dolokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.\n\nBoris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to\nPierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.\n\n\"It will interest you,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, very much,\" replied Pierre.\n\nHalf an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova, and Bennigsen and\nhis suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the\nline.');

They rode across that bridge into\nthe village of Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an\nenormous number of troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where\nmilitiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which\nafterwards became known as the Raevski Redoubt, or the Knoll\nBattery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it. He did not know\nthat it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on\nthe plain of Borodino.\n\nThey then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, where the soldiers were\ndragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode\ndownhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if\nby hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the\nfurrows of the plowed land, and reached some fleches* which were still\nbeing dug.\n\n\n*A kind of entrenchment.\n\n\nAt the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevardino\nRedoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several\nhorsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon\nor Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of\nhorsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the\nscarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men\nrode away from the mound and disappeared.\n\nBennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began\nexplaining the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him,\nstraining each faculty to understand the essential points of the\nimpending battle, but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity\nwas inadequate for the task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen\nstopped speaking and, noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly\nsaid to him:\n\n\"I don\'t think this interests you?\"\n\n\"On the contrary it\'s very interesting!\" replied Pierre not quite\ntruthfully.\n\nFrom the fleches they rode still farther to the left, along a road\nwinding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of\nthe wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the\ntramp of the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the\nroad in front of them for some time, arousing general attention and\nlaughter, and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to\none side and disappear in the thicket. After going through the wood\nfor about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of\nTuchkov\'s corps were stationed to defend the left flank.\n\nHere, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and\nwith much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great\nmilitary importance. In front of Tuchkov\'s troops was some high ground\nnot occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake,\nsaying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the\ncountry around unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the\ngenerals expressed the same opinion. One in particular declared with\nmartial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen\non his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground.\nThis disposition on the left flank increased Pierre\'s doubt of his own\ncapacity to understand military matters. Listening to Bennigsen and\nthe generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill,\nhe quite understood them and shared their opinion, but for that very\nreason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind\nthe hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.\n\nPierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen\nsupposed, put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed\nposition as an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be\nable to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not\nknow this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas\nwithout mentioning the matter to the commander in chief.');

Through a gap in the\nbroken wall he could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty\nyear-old birches with their lower branches lopped off, a field on\nwhich shocks of oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose\nthe smoke of campfires--the soldiers\' kitchens.\n\nNarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed\nto him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable\nas he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.\n\nHe had received and given the orders for next day\'s battle and had\nnothing more to do. But his thoughts--the simplest, clearest, and\ntherefore most terrible thoughts--would give him no peace. He knew\nthat tomorrow\'s battle would be the most terrible of all he had\ntaken part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of\ndeath presented itself to him--not in relation to any worldly matter\nor with reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to\nhimself, to his own soul--vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as\na certainty. And from the height of this perception all that had\npreviously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined\nby a cold white light without shadows, without perspective, without\ndistinction of outline. All life appeared to him like magic-lantern\npictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light\nthrough a glass. Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in\nclear daylight and without a glass. \"Yes, yes! There they are, those\nfalse images that agitated, enraptured, and tormented me,\" said he\nto himself, passing in review the principal pictures of the magic\nlantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of\nhis clear perception of death. \"There they are, those rudely painted\nfigures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of\nsociety, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself--how important these\npictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to\nbe filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold\nwhite light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.\" The three\ngreat sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his love\nfor a woman, his father\'s death, and the French invasion which had\noverrun half Russia. \"Love... that little girl who seemed to me\nbrimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made\nromantic plans of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I\nwas!\" he said aloud bitterly. \"Ah me! I believed in some ideal love\nwhich was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence!\nLike the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me....\nBut it was much simpler really.... It was all very simple and\nhorrible.\"\n\n\"When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his\nland, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,\nunconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his\npath, and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess\nMary says it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when\nhe is not here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is\nthe trial intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And\ntomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one\nof our own men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as\none of them did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by\nhead and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under\ntheir noses, and new conditions of life will arise, which will seem\nquite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall\nnot exist...\"\n\nHe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with\ntheir motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. \"To die...\nto be killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this\nshould still be, but no me....\"\n\nAnd the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the\nsmoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed\nterrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose\nquickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.\n\nAfter he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. \"Who\'s\nthat?\" he cried.\n\nThe red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly Dolokhov\'s squadron\ncommander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander,\nshyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental\npaymaster.\n\nPrince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come\nabout, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss\nthem when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.\n\n\"Devil take it!\" said the voice of a man stumbling over something.\n\nPrince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped\nover a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It\nwas unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in\ngeneral, and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful\nmoments of his last visit to Moscow.\n\n\"You? What a surprise!\" said he. \"What brings you here? This is\nunexpected!\"\n\nAs he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness--they\nexpressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once.

Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed\nwith surprise at Pierre\'s huge stout figure and listened to his talk\nof Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden.\nPrince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding\nthat Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured\nbattalion commander.\n\n\"So you understand the whole position of our troops?\" Prince\nAndrew interrupted him.\n\n\"Yes--that is, how do you mean?\" said Pierre. \"Not being a\nmilitary man I can\'t say I have understood it fully, but I\nunderstand the general position.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,\" said\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince\nAndrew. \"Well, and what do you think of Kutuzov\'s appointment?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I was very glad of his appointment, that\'s all I know,\" replied\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\"And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are\nsaying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?\"\n\n\"Ask them,\" replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.\n\nPierre looked at Timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative\nsmile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.\n\n\"We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your\nexcellency,\" said Timokhin timidly, and continually turning to\nglance at his colonel.\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you.\nWhy, when we were retreating from Sventsyani we dare not touch a stick\nor a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would\nget it all; wasn\'t it so, your excellency?\" and again Timokhin\nturned to the prince. \"But we daren\'t. In our regiment two officers\nwere court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity\ntook command everything became straight forward. Now we see light...\"\n\n\"Then why was it forbidden?\"\n\nTimokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to\nanswer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the\nenemy,\" said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. \"It is very sound: one\ncan\'t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to\nmarauding. At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might\noutflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand\nthis,\" cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him\ninvoluntarily: \"he could not understand that there, for the first\ntime, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit\nin the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the\nFrench for two days, and that that success had increased our\nstrength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and\nlosses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried\nto do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he\nis unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out\neverything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to.\nHow can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, and he\nis a splendid valet and satisfies your father\'s requirements better\nthan you could, then it\'s all right to let him serve. But if your\nfather is mortally sick you\'ll send the valet away and attend to\nyour father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will\nsoothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it\nhas been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could\nserve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in\ndanger she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been\nmaking him out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the\nonly result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their false\naccusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a\ntraitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and\nvery punctilious German.\"\n\n\"And they say he\'s a skillful commander,\" rejoined Pierre.\n\n\"I don\'t understand what is meant by \'a skillful commander,\'\"\nreplied Prince Andrew ironically.\n\n\"A skillful commander?\" replied Pierre. \"Why, one who foresees all\ncontingencies... and foresees the adversary\'s intentions.\"\n\n\"But that\'s impossible,\" said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter\nsettled long ago.\n\nPierre looked at him in surprise.\n\n\"And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?\" he remarked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Prince Andrew, \"but with this little difference, that\nin chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are\nnot limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is\nalways stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than\none, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division\nand sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies\nof troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,\" he went on, \"if\nthings depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there\nmaking arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve\nhere in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us\ntomorrow\'s battle will depend and not on those others.... Success\nnever depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or\neven on numbers, and least of all on position.\"\n\n\"But on what then?\"\n\n\"On the feeling that is in me and in him,\" he pointed to Timokhin,\n\"and in each soldier.\"\n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his commander in\nalarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity\nPrince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from\nexpressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.\n\n\"A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we\nlose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal\nto ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the\nbattle, and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to\nfight for there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as\nwe could. \'We\'ve lost, so let us run,\' and we ran. If we had not\nsaid that till the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened.\nBut tomorrow we shan\'t say it! You talk about our position, the left\nflank weak and the right flank too extended,\" he went on. \"That\'s\nall nonsense, there\'s nothing of the kind. But what awaits us\ntomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided\non the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run,\nand that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at\npresent is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you have\nridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder.\nThey are only concerned with their own petty interests.\"\n\n\"At such a moment?\" said Pierre reproachfully.\n\n\"At such a moment!\" Prince Andrew repeated. \"To them it is only a\nmoment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an\nextra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a\nhundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to\nfight, and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight\nand the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will\nwin. And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and\nwhatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow\'s\nbattle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!\"\n\n\"There now, your excellency! That\'s the truth, the real truth,\" said\nTimokhin. \"Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my\nbattalion, believe me, wouldn\'t drink their vodka! \'It\'s not the day\nfor that!\' they say.\"\n\nAll were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the\nshed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had\ngone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a\nconversation when they heard the clatter of three horses\' hoofs on the\nroad not far from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince\nAndrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack.\nThey rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew\ninvoluntarily heard these words:\n\n\"Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht\ngenug Preis geben,\"* said one of them.\n\n\n*\"The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently commend\nthat view.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, ja,\" said the other, \"der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwachen,\nso kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung\nnehmen.\"*\n\n\n*\"Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of course one\ncannot take into account the loss of private individuals.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no,\" agreed the other.\n\n\"Extend widely!\" said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they\nhad ridden past. \"In that \'extend\' were my father, son, and sister, at\nBald Hills. That\'s all the same to him! That\'s what I was saying to\nyou--those German gentlemen won\'t win the battle tomorrow but will\nonly make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their\nGerman heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven\'t in\ntheir hearts the one thing needed tomorrow--that which Timokhin has.\nThey have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us.\nFine teachers!\" and again his voice grew shrill.\n\n\"So you think we shall win tomorrow\'s battle?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Prince Andrew absently. \"One thing I would do\nif I had the power,\" he began again, \"I would not take prisoners.\nWhy take prisoners? It\'s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home\nand are on their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are\noutraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are\nall criminals. And so thinks Timokhin and the whole army. They\nshould be executed! Since they are my foes they cannot be my\nfriends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince\nAndrew. \"I quite agree with you!\"\n\nThe question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill and\nall that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He\nnow understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the\nimpending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and\nstern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for\nhim by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in\nphysics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,\nand this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly,\nand as it were lightheartedly.\n\n\"Not take prisoners,\" Prince Andrew continued: \"That by itself would\nquite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have\nplayed at war--that\'s what\'s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that\nstuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and\nsensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed:\nshe is so kindhearted that she can\'t look at blood, but enjoys eating\nthe calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of\nchivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on.\nIt\'s all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they\nhumbugged us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people\'s\nhouses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my\nchildren and my father, and then talk of rules of war and\nmagnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who\nhas come to this as I have through the same sufferings...\"\n\nPrince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or\nnot Moscow was taken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly checked in his\nspeech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a\nfew times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips\nquivered as he began speaking.\n\n\"If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war\nonly when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then\nthere would not be war because Paul Ivanovich had offended Michael\nIvanovich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war!\nAnd then the determination of the troops would be quite different.\nThen all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading\nwould not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in\nAustria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the\nmost horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not\nplay at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and\nseriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be\nwar and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the\nidle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.\n\n\"But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are\nthe habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of\nwar are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a\ncountry\'s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army,\nand fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the\nmilitary class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline,\nidleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in\nspite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.\nAll the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he\nwho kills most people receives the highest rewards.\n\n\"They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they\nkill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services\nfor having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number),\nand they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they\nhave killed the greater their achievement. How does God above look\nat them and hear them?\" exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill,\npiercing voice. \"Ah, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to\nlive. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn\'t\ndo for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil....\nAh, well, it\'s not for long!\" he added.\n\n\"However, you\'re sleepy, and it\'s time for me to sleep. Go back to\nGorki!\" said Prince Andrew suddenly.\n\n\"Oh no!\" Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,\ncompassionate eyes.\n\n\"Go, go! Before a battle one must have one\'s sleep out,\" repeated\nPrince Andrew.\n\nHe came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him.\n\"Good-by, be off!\" he shouted. \"Whether we meet again or not...\"\nand turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.\n\nIt was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the\nexpression of Prince Andrew\'s face was angry or tender.\n\nFor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should\nfollow him or go away. \"No, he does not want it!\" Pierre concluded.\n\"And I know that this is our last meeting!\" He sighed deeply and\nrode back to Gorki.\n\nOn re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he\ncould not sleep.\n\nHe closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his\nimagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly\nrecalled an evening in Petersburg. Natasha with animated and excited\nface was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the\nprevious summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She\nincoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a\ntalk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to\nsay: \"No, I can\'t! I\'m not telling it right; no, you don\'t\nunderstand,\" though he encouraged her by saying that he did\nunderstand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say. But\nNatasha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did\nnot convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that\nday and wished to convey. \"He was such a delightful old man, and it\nwas so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can\'t\ndescribe it,\" she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew\nsmiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her\neyes. \"I understood her,\" he thought. \"I not only understood her,\nbut it was just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that\nfrankness of soul--that very soul of hers which seemed to be\nfettered by her body--it was that soul I loved in her... loved so\nstrongly and happily...\" and suddenly he remembered how his love had\nended. \"He did not need anything of that kind. He neither saw nor\nunderstood anything of the sort. He only saw in her a pretty and fresh\nyoung girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?...\nand he is still alive and gay!\"\n\nPrince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again\nbegan pacing up and down in front of the shed.');

Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now\nhis back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his\nvalet was rubbing him down. Another valet, with his finger over the\nmouth of a bottle, was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor\'s\npampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone\nknew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon\'s\nshort hair was wet and matted on the forehead, but his face, though\npuffy and yellow, expressed physical satisfaction. \"Go on, harder,\ngo on!\" he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him, slightly\ntwitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who had entered the bedroom\nto report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in\nyesterday\'s action, was standing by the door after delivering his\nmessage, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked\nat him from under his brows.\n\n\"No prisoners!\" said he, repeating the aide-de-camp\'s words. \"They\nare forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the\nRussian army.... Go on... harder, harder!\" he muttered, hunching his\nback and presenting his fat shoulders.\n\n\"All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,\" he\nsaid, nodding to the aide-de-camp.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of\nthe tent.\n\nTwo valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform\nof the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.\n\nDe Beausset\'s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the\npresent he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in\nfront of the entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such\nunexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the\nsurprise.\n\nNapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that\nthey were not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure\nof giving him a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and\ncalled Fabvier to him, listening silently and with a stern frown to\nwhat Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops\nfighting at Salamanca, at the other end of Europe, with but one\nthought--to be worthy of their Emperor--and but one fear--to fail to\nplease him. The result of that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon\nmade ironic remarks during Fabvier\'s account, as if he had not\nexpected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.\n\n\"I must make up for that in Moscow,\" said Napoleon. \"I\'ll see you\nlater,\" he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had\nprepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and\ncovered it with a cloth.\n\nDe Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the\nold retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,\npresenting an envelope.\n\nNapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.\n\n\"You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?\"\nhe asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most\ncordial tone.\n\n\"Sire, all Paris regrets your absence,\" replied de Beausset as was\nproper.\n\nBut though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of\nthis kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he\nwas pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching\nhis ear.\n\n\"I am very sorry to have made you travel so far,\" said he.\n\n\"Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of\nMoscow,\" replied de Beausset.\n\nNapoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the\nright. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a\ngold snuffbox, which he took.\n\n\"Yes, it has happened luckily for you,\" he said, raising the open\nsnuffbox to his nose. \"You are fond of travel, and in three days you\nwill see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic\ncapital. You will have a pleasant journey.\"\n\nDe Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel\n(of which he had not till then been aware).\n\n\"Ha, what\'s this?\" asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers\nwere looking at something concealed under a cloth.\n\nWith courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without\nturning his back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the\ncloth at the same time, and said:\n\n\"A present to Your Majesty from the Empress.\"\n\nIt was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gerard, of the son\nborne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy\nwhom for some reason everyone called \"The King of Rome.\"\n\nA very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the\nSistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball\nrepresented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a\nscepter.\n\nThough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by\ndepicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick,\nthe allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all\nwho had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.\n\n\"The King of Rome!\" he said, pointing to the portrait with a\ngraceful gesture. \"Admirable!\"\n\nWith the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the\nexpression of his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and\nassumed a look of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said\nand did would be historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be\nbest for him--whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball\nwith the terrestrial globe--to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the\nsimplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward,\nglanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and\nsat down on it before the portrait. At a single gesture from him\neveryone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and\nhis emotion.\n\nHaving sat still for a while he touched--himself not knowing why--the\nthick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,\nrose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the\nportrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed\nround it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of\nRome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.\n\nAnd while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with\nhim, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of\nthe officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the\nportrait.\n\n\"Vive l\'Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l\'Empereur!\" came\nthose ecstatic cries.\n\nAfter breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset\'s presence dictated his\norder of the day to the army.\n\n\"Short and energetic!\" he remarked when he had read over the\nproclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections.\nIt ran:\n\n\nSoldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends\non you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need:\ncomfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you\ndid at Austerlitz, Friedland, Vitebsk, and Smolensk. Let our\nremotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride. Let\nit be said of each of you: \"He was in the great battle before Moscow!\"\n\n\n\"Before Moscow!\" repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who\nwas so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of\nthe tent to where the horses stood saddled.\n\n\"Your Majesty is too kind!\" replied de Beausset to the invitation to\naccompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride\nand was afraid of doing so.\n\nBut Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount.\nWhen Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before\nhis son\'s portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.\n\n\"Take him away!\" he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic\ngesture to the portrait. \"It is too soon for him to see a field of\nbattle.\"\n\nDe Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to\nindicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor\'s\nwords.');

That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it\nthe ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to\nanyone, military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It\nwould seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this\nconclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the\nEmperor and his marshals, nor was there any need of that special and\nsupreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to\nNapoleon; yet the historians who described the event later and the men\nwho then surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.\n\nNapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a\nprofound air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head\ndubiously, and without communicating to the generals around him the\nprofound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them\nhis final conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a\nsuggestion from Davout, who was now called Prince d\'Eckmuhl, to turn\nthe Russian left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without\nexplaining why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to\nattack the fleches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon\nagreed, though the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to\nremark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might\ndisorder the division.\n\nHaving inspected the country opposite the Shevardino Redoubt,\nNapoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots\nwhere two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against\nthe Russian entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them,\nthe field artillery should be placed.\n\nAfter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and\nthe dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.\n\nThese dispositions, of which the French historians write with\nenthusiasm and other historians with profound respect, were as\nfollows:\n\n\nAt dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the\nplain occupied by the Prince d\'Eckmuhl will open fire on the\nopposing batteries of the enemy.\n\nAt the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,\nGeneral Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan\'s division and all\nthe howitzers of Dessaix\'s and Friant\'s divisions, will move\nforward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy\'s\nbattery, against which will operate:\n\n        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards\n        30 guns of Campan\'s division\n\nand      8 guns of Friant\'s and Dessaix\'s divisions\n        --\n\nin all  62 guns.\n\n\nThe commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouche,\nwill place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all,\non the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on\nthe left, which will have forty guns in all directed against it.\n\nGeneral Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all\nthe howitzers of the Guard\'s artillery against either one or other\nof the entrenchments.\n\nDuring the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the\nwood on the village and turn the enemy\'s position.\n\nGeneral Campan will move through the wood to seize the first\nfortification.\n\nAfter the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given\nin accordance with the enemy\'s movements.\n\nThe cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of\nthe right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand\'s division and\nof the vice-King\'s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the\nattack commence on the right wing.\n\nThe vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three\nbridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand\'s and Gibrard\'s\ndivisions, which under his leadership will be directed against the\nredoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.\n\nAll this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et\nmethode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.\n   The Imperial Camp near Mozhaysk,\n   September, 6, 1812.\n\n\nThese dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one\nallows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his\ngenius, related to Napoleon\'s orders to deal with four points--four\ndifferent orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.\n\nIn the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the\nspot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouche; which\nwere to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and\nshower shells on the Russian fleches and redoubts. This could not be\ndone, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not\ncarry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until\nthe nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon\'s instructions, moved them\nforward.\n\nThe second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through\nthe wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done\nand was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village\nthrough the wood, met Tuchkov there barring his way, and could not and\ndid not turn the Russian position.\n\nThe third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to\nseize the first fortification. General Campan\'s division did not seize\nthe first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from\nthe wood it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was\nunaware.\n\nThe fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village\n(Borodino) and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same\nheights as Morand\'s and Gdrard\'s divisions (for whose movements no\ndirections are given), which under his leadership will be directed\nagainst the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.\n\nAs far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible\nsentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders\ngiven him, he was to advance from the left through Borodino to the\nredoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gerard were to advance\nsimultaneously from the front.\n\nAll this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could\nnot be executed. After passing through Borodino the vice-King was\ndriven back to the Kolocha and could get no farther; while the\ndivisions of Morand and Gerard did not take the redoubt but were\ndriven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle\nby the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by\nNapoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition was, or could\nbe, executed. But in the disposition it is said that, after the\nfight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given in accordance\nwith the enemy\'s movements, and so it might be supposed that all\nnecessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle.\nBut this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle\nNapoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know\nthe course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight\ncould be executed.');

To historians who believe that\nRussia was shaped by the will of one man--Peter the Great--and that\nFrance from a republic became an empire and French armies went to\nRussia at the will of one man--Napoleon--to say that Russia remained a\npower because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August\nmay seem logical and convincing.\n\nIf it had depended on Napoleon\'s will to fight or not to fight the\nbattle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement depended\non his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of\nhis will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who\nomitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth\nwould have been the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought\nsuch a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction\nVoltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he\nsaw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX\'s\nstomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that Russia was\nformed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French Empire\nwas formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man,\nNapoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but\ncontrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic\nevents another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of\nhuman events is predetermined from on high--depends on the coincidence\nof the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon\'s\ninfluence on the course of these events is purely external and\nfictitious.\n\nStrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX\'s will, though\nhe gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that\norder; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of\neighty thousand men at Borodino was not due to Napoleon\'s will, though\nhe ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it\nwas done because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions\nappear, yet human dignity--which tells me that each of us is, if not\nmore at least not less a man than the great Napoleon--demands the\nacceptance of that solution of the question, and historic\ninvestigation abundantly confirms it.\n\nAt the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.\nThat was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who\nkilled people.\n\nThe French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of\nBorodino not because of Napoleon\'s orders but by their own volition.\nThe whole army--French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch--hungry,\nragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army\nblocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be\ndrunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians, they\nwould have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because\nit was inevitable.\n\nWhen they heard Napoleon\'s proclamation offering them, as\ncompensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about\ntheir having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried \"Vive\nl\'Empereur!\" just as they had cried \"Vive l\'Empereur!\" at the sight of\nthe portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy\nstick, and just as they would have cried \"Vive l\'Empereur!\" at any\nnonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to\ndo but cry \"Vive l\'Empereur!\" and go to fight, in order to get food\nand rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of\nNapoleon\'s commands that they killed their fellow men.\n\nAnd it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for\nnone of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know\nwhat was going on before him. So the way in which these people\nkilled one another was not decided by Napoleon\'s will but occurred\nindependently of him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands\nof people who took part in the common action. It only seemed to\nNapoleon that it all took place by his will. And so the question\nwhether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than\nthe cold of the least of the transport soldiers.\n\nMoreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was\nthe cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former\noccasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as\npreviously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon\'s\ncold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.\n\nThe dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even\nbetter, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories.\nHis pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than\nformerly, but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders\nonly seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodino\nwas the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent\ndispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist\ncriticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a\nbattle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and\norders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to\ndemonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been\nwon.\n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of\nAusterlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition,\nbut still they were criticized--criticized for their very\nperfection, for their excessive minuteness.\n\nNapoleon at the battle of Borodino fulfilled his office as\nrepresentative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other\nbattles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he\ninclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did\nnot contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the\nfield of battle, but with his great tact and military experience\ncarried out his role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.');

He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to\nsleep, and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the\ndampness of the evening, he went into the large division of the tent\nat three o\'clock in the morning, loudly blowing his nose.

Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always\nsaid so and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the\nGuards are intact?\" he remarked interrogatively.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied Rapp.\n\nNapoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his\nwatch. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was\nimpossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for\nthe orders had all been given and were now being executed.\n\n\"Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of\nthe Guards?\" asked Napoleon sternly.\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"The rice too?\"\n\nRapp replied that he had given the Emperor\'s order about the rice,\nbut Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing\nthat his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch.\nNapoleon ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently\nsipped his own.\n\n\"I have neither taste nor smell,\" he remarked, sniffing at his glass.\n\"This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine--what is the good of\nmedicine when it can\'t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges\nbut they don\'t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can\'t cure\nanything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that,\nit is its nature.

Yes, our body is just a machine for\nliving, that is all.\"\n\nAnd having entered on the path of definition, of which he was\nfond, Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.\n\n\"Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?\" asked he. \"It is the\nart of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That\'s all.\"\n\nRapp made no reply.\n\n\"Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutuzov!\" said Napoleon. \"We\nshall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three\nweeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments....\nWe shall see!\"\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was still only four o\'clock. He did not\nfeel sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do.\nHe rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went\nout of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible\nmoisture was descending from above.

The weather was calm, and\nthe rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to\ntake up their positions were clearly audible.\n\nNapoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires\nand listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman\nin a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had\ndrawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon\nstopped in front of him.\n\n\"What year did you enter the service?\" he asked with that\naffectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always\naddressed the soldiers.\n\nThe man answered the question.\n\n\"Ah!

The panes were rattling in the little windows and his\ngroom was shaking him.\n\n\"Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!\" he kept\nrepeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without\nlooking at him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.\n\n\"What? Has it begun? Is it time?\" Pierre asked, waking up.\n\n\"Hear the firing,\" said the groom, a discharged soldier. \"All the\ngentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past\nlong ago.\"\n\nPierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was\nbright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from\nbehind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still\nhalf broken by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on\nthe dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on\nthe windows, the fence, and on Pierre\'s horses standing before the\nhut. The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant\naccompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.\n\n\"It\'s time, Count; it\'s time!\" cried the adjutant.\n\nTelling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down\nthe street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of\nbattle the day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there,\nmembers of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and\nKutuzov\'s gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his\ngray nape sunk between his shoulders. He was looking through a field\nglass down the highroad before him.\n\nMounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before\nhim, spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired\nfrom that spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of\ntroops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting\nrays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre,\ncast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of\nrosy, golden tinted light and long dark shadows. The forest at the\nfarthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious\nstone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was\nsilhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valuevo by\nthe Smolensk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered\ngolden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be\nseen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was\nvivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all\nwas the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodino and the hollows on\nboth sides of the Kolocha.\n\nAbove the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of it, especially\nto the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls\ninto the Kolocha, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve,\nand to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and\nmagically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns\nmingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through that\nmist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing back like\nlightning from the water, from the dew, and from the bayonets of the\ntroops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodino. A white\nchurch could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of\nhuts in Borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green\nammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move,\nas the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in\nthe mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino, so along the entire line\noutside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the\nleft, in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds\nof powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now\nsingly, now several at a time, some translucent, others dense,\nwhich, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over the\nwhole expanse.\n\nThese puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of\nthe firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.\n\n\"Puff!\"--suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging\nfrom violet into gray and milky white, and \"boom!\" came the report a\nsecond later.\n\n\"Puff! puff!\"--and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending\ntogether; and \"boom, boom!\" came the sounds confirming what the eye\nhad seen.\n\nPierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a\nround compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke\nfloating to one side, and--\"puff\" (with a pause)--\"puff, puff!\"\nthree and then four more appeared and then from each, with the same\ninterval--\"boom--boom, boom!\" came the fine, firm, precise sounds in\nreply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and\nsometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran\npast them. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of\nsmoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports,\nwhile nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the\nmuskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had\ntheir little echoes in just the same way. \"Trakh-ta-ta-takh!\" came the\nfrequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in\ncomparison with the reports of the cannon.\n\nPierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets,\nthat movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov and\nhis suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They\nwere all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed\nto him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining\nwith that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before\nand had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!\" Kutuzov was\nsaying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from\nthe battlefield.\n\nHaving received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way\ndown the knoll.\n\n\"To the crossing!\" said the general coldly and sternly in reply to\none of the staff who asked where he was going.\n\n\"I\'ll go there too, I too!\" thought Pierre, and followed the\ngeneral.\n\nThe general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went\nto his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the\nquietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out\nhis toes pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his\nspectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and\nreins, he galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to\nsmile as they watched him from the knoll.');

He tried to\npass either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were\nsoldiers everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy\nwith some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the\nsame dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a\nwhite hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them\nunder his horse\'s hoofs.\n\n\"Why ride into the middle of the battalion?\" one of them shouted\nat him.\n\nAnother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,\nbending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying\nhorse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.\n\nThere was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood\nfiring. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had\ncome to the bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino,\nwhich the French (having occupied Borodino) were attacking in the\nfirst phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front\nof him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it\nand in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken\nno notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but\ndespite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this\nwas the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of the bullets\nwhistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him,\ndid not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long\ntime did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him.\nHe looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face.\n\n\"Why\'s that fellow in front of the line?\" shouted somebody at him\nagain.\n\n\"To the left!... Keep to the right!\" the men shouted to him.\n\nPierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of\nRaevski\'s adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at\nhim, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing\nhim he nodded.\n\n\"How have you got here?\" he said, and galloped on.\n\nPierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid\nof getting in someone\'s way again, galloped after the adjutant.\n\n\"What\'s happening here? May I come with you?\" he asked.\n\n\"One moment, one moment!\" replied the adjutant, and riding up to a\nstout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message\nand then addressed Pierre.\n\n\"Why have you come here, Count?\" he asked with a smile. \"Still\ninquisitive?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" assented Pierre.\n\nBut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.\n\n\"Here it\'s tolerable,\" said he, \"but with Bagration on the left\nflank they\'re getting it frightfully hot.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Pierre. \"Where is that?\"\n\n\"Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and\nin our battery it is still bearable,\" said the adjutant. \"Will you\ncome?\"\n\n\"Yes, I\'ll come with you,\" replied Pierre, looking round for his\ngroom.\n\nIt was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or\nbeing carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over\nthe day before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay,\nwith his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.\n\n\"Why haven\'t they carried him away?\" Pierre was about to ask, but\nseeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking\nthat way, he checked himself.\n\nPierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the\nadjutant to Raevski\'s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the\nadjutant\'s and jolted him at every step.\n\n\"You don\'t seem to be used to riding, Count?\" remarked the adjutant.\n\n\"No it\'s not that, but her action seems so jerky,\" said Pierre in\na puzzled tone.\n\n\"Why... she\'s wounded!\" said the adjutant. \"In the off foreleg above\nthe knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your\nbaptism of fire!\"\n\nHaving ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the\nartillery which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening\nthem with the noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was\ncool and quiet, with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant\ndismounted and walked up the hill on foot.\n\n\"Is the general here?\" asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.\n\n\"He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,\" someone\ntold him, pointing to the right.\n\nThe adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.\n\n\"Don\'t trouble about me,\" said Pierre. \"I\'ll go up onto the knoll if\nI may?\"\n\n\"Yes, do. You\'ll see everything from there and it\'s less\ndangerous, and I\'ll come for you.\"\n\nPierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not\nmeet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm\nthat day.\n\nThe knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards\nknown to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski\'s Redoubt, and\nto the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du\ncentre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French\nregarded as the key to the whole position.\n\nThis redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which\ntrenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that\nwere being fired through openings in the earthwork.\n\nIn line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also\nfired incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When\nascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which\nsmall trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was\nthe most important point of the battle.\n\nOn the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought\nit one of the least significant parts of the field.\n\nHaving reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench\nsurrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with\nan unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about\nthe battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the\nsoldiers who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running\npast him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being\nfired continually one after another with a deafening roar,\nenveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke.\n\nIn contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in\nsupport, here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their\nwork were separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced\na common and as it were family feeling of animation.\n\nThe intrusion of Pierre\'s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made\nan unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at\nhim with surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior\nartillery officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over\nto Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at\nhim with curiosity.\n\nA young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only\njust out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two\nguns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not\nbe here.\"\n\nThe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at\nPierre. But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the\nwhite hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of\nthe trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the\nsoldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if\nhe were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust gradually\nbegan to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers\nfeel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that\nlive with the regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their\nfamily, adopted him, gave him a nickname (\"our gentleman\"), and made\nkindly fun of him among themselves.\n\nA shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around\nwith a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown\nup.\n\n\"And how\'s it you\'re not afraid, sir, really now?\" a red-faced,\nbroad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a\nset of sound, white teeth.\n\n\"Are you afraid, then?\" said Pierre.\n\n\"What else do you expect?\" answered the soldier. \"She has no\nmercy, you know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards.\nOne can\'t help being afraid,\" he said laughing.\n\nSeveral of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.\nThey seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and\nthe discovery that he did so delighted them.\n\n\"It\'s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it\'s\nwonderful! There\'s a gentleman for you!\"\n\n\"To your places!\" cried the young officer to the men gathered\nround Pierre.\n\nThe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the\nfirst or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and\nthe men with great precision and formality.\n\nThe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing\nmore intense over the whole field, especially to the left where\nBagration\'s fleches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing\nmade it almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole\nattention was engrossed by watching the family circle--separated\nfrom all else--formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious\nfeeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the\nbattlefield was now replaced by another, especially since he had\nseen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the\nslope of the trench, he observed the faces of those around him.\n\nBy ten o\'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from\nthe battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more\nfrequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled\naround. But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and\nmerry voices and jokes were heard on all sides.\n\n\"A live one!\" shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.\n\n\"Not this way! To the infantry!\" added another with loud laughter,\nseeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.\n\n\"Are you bowing to a friend, eh?\" remarked another, chaffing a\npeasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.\n\nSeveral soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out\nto see what was happening in front.\n\n\"They\'ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,\" said they,\npointing over the earthwork.\n\n\"Mind your own business,\" an old sergeant shouted at them. \"If\nthey\'ve retired it\'s because there\'s work for them to do farther\nback.\"\n\nAnd the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a\nshove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.\n\n\"To the fifth gun, wheel it up!\" came shouts from one side.\n\n\"Now then, all together, like bargees!\" rose the merry voices of\nthose who were moving the gun.\n\n\"Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman\'s hat off!\" cried the\nred-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. \"Awkward\nbaggage!\" he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon\nwheel and a man\'s leg.\n\n\"Now then, you foxes!\" said another, laughing at some militiamen\nwho, stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.\n\n\"So this gruel isn\'t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You\'re scared!\"\nthey shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man\nwhose leg had been torn off.\n\n\"There, lads... oh, oh!\" they mimicked the peasants, \"they don\'t\nlike it at all!\"\n\nPierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after\nevery loss, the liveliness increased more and more.\n\nAs the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly\nand rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in\nopposition to what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire\ngrowing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men.\n\nPierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned\nto know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching\nthis fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was\nflaming up in the same way in his own soul.\n\nAt ten o\'clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in\nfront of the battery and along the Kamenka streamlet retreated. From\nthe battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their\nwounded on their muskets. A general with his suite came to the\nbattery, and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look\nand went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the\nbattery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from\namid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the\nsound of a drum and shouts of command, and from the battery one saw\nhow those ranks of infantry moved forward.\n\nPierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly\nstruck by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was\nwalking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.\n\nThe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their\nlong-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few\nminutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back\nfrom that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently\nin the battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed.\nAround the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No\none any longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted\nat for being in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid\nstrides from one gun to another with a frowning face. The young\nofficer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more\nscrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned,\nloaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave\nlittle jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs.\n\nThe stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire\nwhich Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing\nbeside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his\nshako, ran up to his superior.\n\n\"I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left.\nAre we to continue firing?\" he asked.\n\n\"Grapeshot!\" the senior shouted, without answering the question,\nlooking over the wall of the trench.\n\nSuddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and\nbending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing.\nEverything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre\'s eyes.\n\nOne cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the\nearthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these\nsounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery\nsoldiers shouting \"Hurrah!\" were running not forwards but backwards,\nit seemed to Pierre.\n\nA cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he\nwas standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before\nhis eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some\nmilitiamen who were entering the battery ran back.\n\n\"All with grapeshot!\" shouted the officer.\n\nThe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper\ninformed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is\nno more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.\n\n\"The scoundrels! What are they doing?\" shouted the officer,\nturning to Pierre.\n\nThe officer\'s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered\nunder his frowning brow.\n\n\"Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!\" he\nyelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.\n\n\"I\'ll go,\" said Pierre.\n\nThe officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite\nside.\n\n\"Don\'t fire.... Wait!\" he shouted.\n\nThe man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against\nPierre.\n\n\"Eh, sir, this is no place for you,\" said he, and ran down the\nslope.\n\nPierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer\nwas sitting.\n\nOne cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in\nfront, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. \"Where am\nI going?\" he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green\nammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to\nreturn or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to\nthe ground. At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of\nflame, and immediately a deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made\nhis ears tingle.\n\nWhen he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on\nhis hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer\nexisted, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched\ngrass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it,\ngalloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground,\nuttering prolonged and piercing cries.');

He saw the senior\nofficer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were\nexamining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had\nnoticed before was struggling forward shouting \"Brothers!\" and\ntrying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the\narm. He also saw something else that was strange.\n\nBut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed,\nthat the soldier shouting \"Brothers!\" was a prisoner, and that another\nman had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had\nhe run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in\na blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something.\nInstinctively guarding against the shock--for they had been running\ntogether at full speed before they saw one another--Pierre put out his\nhands and seized the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one\nhand and by the throat with the other. The officer, dropping his\nsword, seized Pierre by his collar.\n\nFor some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another\'s\nunfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and\nwhat they were to do next. \"Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him\nprisoner?\" each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently\nmore inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre\'s\nstrong hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever\ntighter and tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when\njust above their heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled,\nand it seemed to Pierre that the French officer\'s head had been torn\noff, so swiftly had he ducked it.\n\nPierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further\nthought as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to\nthe battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead\nand wounded who, it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he\nreached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian\nsoldiers who, stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and\nwildly toward the battery. (This was the attack for which Ermolov\nclaimed the credit, declaring that only his courage and good luck made\nsuch a feat possible: it was the attack in which he was said to have\nthrown some St. George\'s Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery\nfor the first soldiers to take who got there.)\n\nThe French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops\nshouting \"Hurrah!\" pursued them so far beyond the battery that it\nwas difficult to call them back.\n\nThe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them\nwas a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds\nof wounded--some known to Pierre and some unknown--Russians and\nFrench, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were\ncarried on stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto\nthe knoll where he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle\nwhich had received him as a member he did not find a single one. There\nwere many dead whom he did not know, but some he recognized. The young\nofficer still sat in the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood\nat the edge of the earth wall. The red-faced man was still\ntwitching, but they did not carry him away.\n\nPierre ran down the slope once more.\n\n\"Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have\ndone!\" he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers\nmoving from the battlefield.\n\nBut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front\nand especially to the left, near Semenovsk, something seemed to be\nseething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not\ndiminish, but even increased to desperation like a man who,\nstraining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength.');

Beyond\nthat space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the\nRussians with Uvarov\'s cavalry at midday, and on the other side,\nbeyond Utitsa, Poniatowski\'s collision with Tuchkov; but these two\nwere detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in\nthe center of the battlefield. On the field between Borodino and the\nfleches, beside the wood, the chief action of the day took place on an\nopen space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest\nand most artless way.\n\nThe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred\nguns.\n\nThen when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,\nCampan\'s and Dessaix\'s, advanced from the French right, while\nMurat\'s troops advanced on Borodino from their left.\n\nFrom the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the\nfleches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as\nthe crow flies to Borodino, so that Napoleon could not see what was\nhappening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid\nthe whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix\'s division advancing\nagainst the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the\nhollow that lay between them and the fleches. As soon as they had\ndescended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and musketry on\nthe fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that\nside of it. Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something\nblack--probably men--and at times the glint of bayonets. But whether\nthey were moving or stationary, whether they were French or Russian,\ncould not be discovered from the Shevardino Redoubt.\n\nThe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight\ninto Napoleon\'s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked\nat the fleches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it\nlooked as if the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved.\nSometimes shouts were heard through the firing, but it was\nimpossible to tell what was being done there.\n\nNapoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and\nin its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and\nsometimes Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he\ncould not tell where what he had seen was.\n\nHe descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.\n\nOccasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed\nintently at the battlefield.\n\nBut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from\nwhere he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which\nsome of his generals had taken their stand, but even from the\nfleches themselves--in which by this time there were now Russian and\nnow French soldiers, alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive,\nfrightened, or maddened--even at those fleches themselves it was\nimpossible to make out what was taking place. There for several\nhours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire, now Russians were\nseen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, and now cavalry: they\nappeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to do with one\nanother, screamed, and ran back again.\n\nFrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his\nmarshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress\nof the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was\nimpossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any\ngiven moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the\nactual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others;\nand also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to\nNapoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already\nbecoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings\nthat Borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolocha was in\nthe hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished\nthe troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should\nform up on the farther side and wait. But before that order was\ngiven--almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodino--the\nbridge had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very\nskirmish at which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the\nbattle.\n\nAn adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and\nfrightened face and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been\nrepulsed, Campan wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time\nthe adjutant had been told that the French had been repulsed, the\nfleches had in fact been recaptured by other French troops, and Davout\nwas alive and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily\nuntrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either\nbeen executed before he gave them or could not be and were not\nexecuted.\n\nThe marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle\nbut, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and\nonly occasionally went within musket range, made their own\narrangements without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in\nwhat direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry\nshould run. But even their orders, like Napoleon\'s, were seldom\ncarried out, and then but partially. For the most part things happened\ncontrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on\nmeeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they were,\nsuddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed\nback and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without orders in\npursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry regiments\ngalloped through the Semenovsk hollow and as soon as they reached\nthe top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back\nagain. The infantry moved in the same way, sometimes running to\nquite other places than those they were ordered to go to. All orders\nas to where and when to move the guns, when to send infantry to\nshoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry--all such orders\nwere given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned,\nwithout asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less Napoleon.\nThey did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or\nfor acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at stake\nis what is dearest to man--his own life--and it sometimes seems that\nsafety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these\nmen who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the\nmood of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward\nand backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops.\nAll their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the\nharm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that\nflew over the fields on which these men were floundering about. As\nsoon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying\nabout, their superiors, located in the background, re-formed them\nand brought them under discipline and under the influence of that\ndiscipline led them back to the zone of fire, where under the\ninfluence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about\naccording to the chance promptings of the throng.');

But contrary to what had always\nhappened in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of\nthe enemy\'s flight, these orderly masses returned thence as\ndisorganized and terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but\ntheir numbers constantly decreased. In the middle of the day Murat\nsent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.\n\nNapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when\nMurat\'s adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would\nbe routed if His Majesty would let him have another division.\n\n\"Reinforcements?\" said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking\nat the adjutant--a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like\nMurat\'s own--as though he did not understand his words.\n\n\"Reinforcements!\" thought Napoleon to himself. \"How can they need\nreinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a\nweak, unentrenched Russian wing?\"\n\n\"Tell the King of Naples,\" said he sternly, \"that it is not noon\nyet, and I don\'t yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...\"\n\nThe handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without\nremoving his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were\nbeing slaughtered.\n\nNapoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began\ntalking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.\n\nIn the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest\nNapoleon, Berthier\'s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite,\nwho was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was\nBelliard. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid\nstrides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity\nof sending reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians\nwere lost if the Emperor would give another division.\n\nNapoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down\nwithout replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the\ngenerals of the suite around him.\n\n\"You are very fiery, Belliard,\" said Napoleon, when he again came up\nto the general. \"In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake.\nGo and have another look and then come back to me.\"\n\nBefore Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of\nthe battlefield galloped up.\n\n\"Now then, what do you want?\" asked Napoleon in the tone of a man\nirritated at being continually disturbed.\n\n\"Sire, the prince...\" began the adjutant.\n\n\"Asks for reinforcements?\" said Napoleon with an angry gesture.\n\nThe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but\nthe Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came\nback, and called Berthier.\n\n\"We must give reserves,\" he said, moving his arms slightly apart.\n\"Who do you think should be sent there?\" he asked of Berthier (whom he\nsubsequently termed \"that gosling I have made an eagle\").\n\n\"Send Claparede\'s division, sire,\" replied Berthier, who knew all\nthe divisions regiments, and battalions by heart.\n\nNapoleon nodded assent.\n\nThe adjutant galloped to Claparede\'s division and a few minutes\nlater the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward.\nNapoleon gazed silently in that direction.\n\n\"No!\" he suddenly said to Berthier. \"I can\'t send Claparede. Send\nFriant\'s division.\"\n\nThough there was no advantage in sending Friant\'s division instead\nof Claparede\'s, and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in\nstopping Claparede and sending Friant now, the order was carried out\nexactly. Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was\nplaying the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines--a role he\nso justly understood and condemned.\n\nFriant\'s division disappeared as the others had done into the\nsmoke of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive\nat a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all\nasked for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding\ntheir positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the\nFrench army was melting away.\n\nNapoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.\n\nM. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since\nmorning, came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest\nlunch to His Majesty.\n\n\"I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?\" said he.\n\nNapoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the\nnegation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de\nBeausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is\nno reason for not having lunch when one can get it.\n\n\"Go away...\" exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned\naside.\n\nA beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M.\nde Beausset\'s face and he glided away to the other generals.\n\nNapoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an\never-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and\nalways winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances\nof the game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely\nhe loses.\n\nHis troops were the same, his generals the same, the same\npreparations had been made, the same dispositions, and the same\nproclamation courte et energique, he himself was still the same: he\nknew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and\nskillful than before. Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and\nFriedland--yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally\nbecome impotent.\n\nAll the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with\nsuccess: the concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by\nreserves to break the enemy\'s line, and a cavalry attack by \"the men\nof iron,\" all these methods had already been employed, yet not only\nwas there no victory, but from all sides came the same news of\ngenerals killed and wounded, of reinforcements needed, of the\nimpossibility of driving back the Russians, and of disorganization\namong his own troops.\n\nFormerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few\nphrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with\ncongratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the\ncorps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon\nand stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to\ngather in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola,\nJena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was\nhappening to his troops.\n\nDespite news of the capture of the fleches, Napoleon saw that this\nwas not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his\nformer battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the\nmen about him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked\ndejected, and they all shunned one another\'s eyes--only a de\nBeausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening.\n\nBut Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning\nof a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all\nefforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and\nthat the least accident might now--with the fight balanced on such a\nstrained center--destroy him and his army.\n\nWhen he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign\nin which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or\ncannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he\nlooked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard\nreports of the Russians still holding their ground--a terrible feeling\nlike a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents\nthat might destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall\non his left wing, might break through his center, he himself might\nbe killed by a stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former\nbattles he had only considered the possibilities of success, but now\ninnumerable unlucky chances presented themselves, and he expected them\nall. Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is\ncoming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a\nterrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels\nthat his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of\nunavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness.\n\nThe news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the\nFrench army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a\ncampstool below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees.\nBerthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line\nto ascertain the position of affairs.\n\n\"What? What do you say?\" asked Napoleon. \"Yes, tell them to bring me\nmy horse.\"\n\nHe mounted and rode toward Semenovsk.\n\nAmid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space\nthrough which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of\nblood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals\nhad ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small\narea. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the\near and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does\nto tableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semenovsk,\nand through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color\nunfamiliar to him. They were Russians.\n\nThe Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk village and its\nknoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent\nforth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a\ncontinuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French\nor the Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the\nreverie from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what\nwas going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed\nby him and to depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair,\nfor the first time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.\n\nOne of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to\nlead the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near\nNapoleon, exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this\ngeneral\'s senseless offer.\n\nNapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.\n\n\"At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard\ndestroyed!\" he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevardino.');

He gave no\norders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.\n\n\"Yes, yes, do that,\" he replied to various proposals. \"Yes, yes: go,\ndear boy, and have a look,\" he would say to one or another of those\nabout him; or, \"No, don\'t, we\'d better wait!\" He listened to the\nreports that were brought him and gave directions when his\nsubordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports\nit seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words\nspoken, but rather in something else--in the expression of face and\ntone of voice of those who were reporting. By long years of military\nexperience he knew, and with the wisdom of age understood, that it\nis impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others\nstruggling with death, and he knew that the result of a battle is\ndecided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where\nthe troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of\nslaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the\narmy, and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in\nhis power.\n\nKutuzov\'s general expression was one of concentrated quiet\nattention, and his face wore a strained look as if he found it\ndifficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body.\n\nAt eleven o\'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by\nthe French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagration was wounded.\nKutuzov groaned and swayed his head.\n\n\"Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about it exactly,\"\nhe said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of\nWurttemberg who was standing behind him.\n\n\"Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?\"\n\nSoon after the duke\'s departure--before he could possibly have\nreached Semenovsk--his adjutant came back from him and told Kutuzov\nthat the duke asked for more troops.\n\nKutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take over\nthe command of the first army, and a request to the duke--whom he said\nhe could not spare at such an important moment--to return to him. When\nthey brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the\nstaff officers congratulated him, Kutuzov smiled.\n\n\"Wait a little, gentlemen,\" said he. \"The battle is won, and there\nis nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is\nbetter to wait before we rejoice.\"\n\nBut he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.\n\nWhen Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that\nthe French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk,\nKutuzov, guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin\'s\nlooks that the news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and,\ntaking Scherbinin\'s arm, led him aside.\n\n\"Go, my dear fellow,\" he said to Ermolov, \"and see whether something\ncan\'t be done.\"\n\nKutuzov was in Gorki, near the center of the Russian position. The\nattack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several\ntimes repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond\nBorodino, and on their left flank Uvarov\'s cavalry had put the\nFrench to flight.\n\nToward three o\'clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of\nall who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around\nhim, Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was\nsatisfied with the day\'s success--a success exceeding his\nexpectations, but the old man\'s strength was failing him. Several\ntimes his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off.\nDinner was brought him.\n\nAdjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince\nAndrew had said, \"the war should be extended widely,\" and whom\nBagration so detested, rode up while Kutuzov was at dinner. Wolzogen\nhad come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on\nthe left flank. The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of\nwounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army,\nweighed all the circumstances, concluded that the battle was lost, and\nsent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news.\n\nKutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and\nglanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering\nlids.\n\nWolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutuzov\nwith a half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak\nof his cap.\n\nHe treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected\nnonchalance intended to show that, as a highly trained military man,\nhe left it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but\nthat he knew whom he was dealing with. \"Der alte Herr\" (as in their\nown set the Germans called Kutuzov) \"is making himself very\ncomfortable,\" thought Wolzogen, and looking severely at the dishes\nin front of Kutuzov he began to report to \"the old gentleman\" the\nposition of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to\nand as he himself had seen and understood it.\n\n\"All the points of our position are in the enemy\'s hands and we\ncannot dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away\nand it is impossible to stop them,\" he reported.\n\nKutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as if\nnot understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing \"the old\ngentleman\'s\" agitation, said with a smile:\n\n\"I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness\nwhat I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder...\"\n\n\"You have seen? You have seen?...\" Kutuzov shouted frowning, and\nrising quickly he went up to Wolzogen.\n\n\"How... how dare you!...\" he shouted, choking and making a\nthreatening gesture with his trembling arms: \"How dare you, sir, say\nthat to me? You know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me\nthat his information is incorrect and that the real course of the\nbattle is better known to me, the commander in chief, than to him.\"\n\nWolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutuzov interrupted him.\n\n\"The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right\nflank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say\nwhat you don\'t know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and\ninform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,\" said\nKutuzov sternly.\n\nAll were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy\nbreathing of the panting old general.\n\n\"They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave\narmy! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the\nsacred soil of Russia,\" said Kutuzov crossing himself, and he suddenly\nsobbed as his eyes filled with tears.\n\nWolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped\nsilently aside, marveling at \"the old gentleman\'s\" conceited\nstupidity.\n\n\"Ah, here he is, my hero!\" said Kutuzov to a portly, handsome,\ndark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.\n\nThis was Raevski, who had spent the whole day at the most\nimportant part of the field of Borodino.\n\nRaevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground\nand that the French no longer ventured to attack.\n\nAfter hearing him, Kutuzov said in French:\n\n\"Then you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is\nalways the most stubborn who remain victors,\" replied Raevski, \"and in\nmy opinion...\"\n\n\"Kaysarov!\" Kutuzov called to his adjutant. \"Sit down and write out\nthe order of the day for tomorrow. And you,\" he continued, addressing\nanother, \"ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.\"\n\nWhile Kutuzov was talking to Raevski and dictating the order of\nthe day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General\nBarclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field\nmarshal had given.\n\nKutuzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the\norder to be written out which the former commander in chief, to\navoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.\n\nAnd by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains\nthroughout an army one and the same temper, known as \"the spirit of\nthe army,\" and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutuzov\'s words,\nhis order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end\nof the army to the other.\n\nIt was far from being the same words or the same order that\nreached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth\nto mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what\nKutuzov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because\nwhat he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a\nfeeling that lay in the commander in chief\'s soul as in that of\nevery Russian.\n\nAnd on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and\nhearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted\nto believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.');

Toward two o\'clock the regiment, having already lost\nmore than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled\noatfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the Knoll Battery, where\nthousands of men perished that day and on which an intense,\nconcentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between\none and two o\'clock.\n\nWithout moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment\nhere lost another third of its men. From in front and especially\nfrom the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the\nmysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front,\nquick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly.\nAt times, as if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed\nduring which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but\nsometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and\nthe slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded\ncarried off.\n\nWith each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those\nnot yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three\nhundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and\nthe same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely\nheard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of\na successful shot and the cry of \"stretchers!\" was heard. Most of\nthe time, by their officers\' order, the men sat on the ground. One,\nhaving taken off his shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its\nlining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry clay\nbetween his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap\nand pulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and\nrefolded his leg bands and put his boots on again. Some built little\nhouses of the tufts in the plowed ground, or plaited baskets from\nthe straw in the cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these\npursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers\nwent past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses of the\nenemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to\nthese things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of\nour infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were heard\non all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences\nquite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if the\nminds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,\ncommonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front\nof the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a\ntrace. \"Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She\'ll\nfall.... Ah, they don\'t see it!\" came identical shouts from the\nranks all along the regiment. Another time, general attention was\nattracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which\ntrotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail\nstiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped,\ntucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and\nshrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But such\ndistractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had\nbeen inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale\nand gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.\n\nPrince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment,\npaced up and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge\nof the meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind\nhis back. There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given.\nEverything went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the\nfront, the wounded carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any\nsoldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily. At\nfirst Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to rouse the courage of\nthe men and to set them an example, walked about among the ranks,\nbut he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that\nthere was nothing he could teach them. All the powers of his soul,\nas of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the\ncontemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the\nmeadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the\ndust that covered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to\nthe footprints left on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his\nsteps, calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to\nwalk a mile, then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that\ngrew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their\npungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained of the previous\nday\'s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with weary ears\nto the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle of flying\nprojectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely\nfamiliar faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited. \"Here it\ncomes... this one is coming our way again!\" he thought, listening to\nan approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. \"One, another!\nAgain! It has hit....\" He stopped and looked at the ranks. \"No, it has\ngone over. But this one has hit!\" And again he started trying to reach\nthe boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces\nfrom him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill\nran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many had\nbeen hit--a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.\n\n\"Adjutant!\" he shouted. \"Order them not to crowd together.\"\n\nThe adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince\nAndrew. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.\n\n\"Look out!\" came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird\nwhirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell\ndropped with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and\nclose to the battalion commander\'s horse. The horse first,\nregardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear, snorted,\nreared almost throwing the major, and galloped aside. The horse\'s\nterror infected the men.\n\n\"Lie down!\" cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.\n\nPrince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between\nhim and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the\nfield and the meadow.\n\n\"Can this be death?\" thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite\nnew, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of\nsmoke that curled up from the rotating black ball. \"I cannot, I do not\nwish to die. I love life--I love this grass, this earth, this air....\"\nHe thought this, and at the same time remembered that people were\nlooking at him.\n\n\"It\'s shameful, sir!\" he said to the adjutant. \"What...\"\n\nHe did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the\nsound of an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking\nwindow frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started\nto one side, raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several\nofficers ran up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood\nwas welling out making a large stain on the grass.\n\nThe militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the\nofficers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,\nbreathing heavily and noisily.\n\n\"What are you waiting for? Come along!\"\n\nThe peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but\nhe moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.\n\n\"Pick him up, lift him, it\'s all the same!\" cried someone.\n\nThey again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.\n\n\"Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My\nGod!\"--voices among the officers were heard saying.\n\n\"It flew a hair\'s breadth past my ear,\" said the adjutant.\n\nThe peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started\nhurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing\nstation.\n\n\"Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!\" shouted an officer, seizing by\ntheir shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly\nand jolting the stretcher.\n\n\"Get into step, Fedor... I say, Fedor!\" said the foremost peasant.\n\n\"Now that\'s right!\" said the one behind joyfully, when he had got\ninto step.\n\n\"Your excellency! Eh, Prince!\" said the trembling voice of Timokhin,\nwho had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.\n\nPrince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from\nthe stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his\neyelids drooped.\n\n\nThe militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the\nwood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of\nthree tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch\nwood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were\neating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and\npecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among\nthe birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than\nfive acres, bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay.\nAround the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with\ndismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in\nvain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers\' orders, the\nsoldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently,\nas if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking\nplace before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now\nplaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or\nto point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men\nawaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed,\nswore, or asked for vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew\'s\nbearers, stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took\nhim, as a regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there\nstopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and\nfor a long time could not make out what was going on around him. He\nremembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black\nball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps from\nhim, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting\ngeneral attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired\nnoncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in\nthe head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his\ntalk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.\n\n\"We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we\ngrabbed the King himself!\" cried he, looking around him with eyes that\nglittered with fever. \"If only reserves had come up just then, lads,\nthere wouldn\'t have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely...\"\n\nLike all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him\nwith shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. \"But isn\'t it\nall the same now?\" thought he. \"And what will be there, and what has\nthere been here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was\nsomething in this life I did not and do not understand.\"');

He raised his head\nand looked about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He\nevidently wanted a little respite. After turning his head from right\nto left for some time, he sighed and looked down.\n\n\"All right, immediately,\" he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince\nAndrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.\n\nMurmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.\n\n\"It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have\na chance!\" remarked one.\n\nPrince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only\njust been cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince\nAndrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent. The\npitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh,\nstomach, and back distracted him. All he saw about him merged into a\ngeneral impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill\nthe whole of the low tent, as a few weeks previously, on that hot\nAugust day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the\nSmolensk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same chair a canon, the\nsight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a\npresentiment.\n\nThere were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied,\nand on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he\nwas left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on\nthe other two tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a\nCossack, judging by the uniform thrown down beside him. Four\nsoldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was cutting into\nhis muscular brown back.\n\n\"Ooh, ooh, ooh!\" grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his\nswarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white\nteeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing,\nringing, and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many\npeople were crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his\nhead thrown back. His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head\nseemed strangely familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were\npressing on his chest to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg\ntwitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor. The man was\nsobbing and choking convulsively. Two doctors--one of whom was pale\nand trembling--were silently doing something to this man\'s other, gory\nleg. When he had finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an\novercoat, the spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his\nhands.\n\nHe glanced at Prince Andrew\'s face and quickly turned away.\n\n\"Undress him! What are you waiting for?\" he cried angrily to the\ndressers.\n\nHis very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to\nPrince Andrew\'s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began\nhastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The\ndoctor bent down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he\nmade a sign to someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused\nPrince Andrew to lose consciousness. When he came to himself the\nsplintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted, the torn\nflesh cut away, and the wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on\nhis face. As soon as Prince Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent\nover, kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away.\n\nAfter the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a\nblissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All\nthe best and happiest moments of his life--especially his earliest\nchildhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when\nleaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head\nin the pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life--returned\nto his memory, not merely as something past but as something present.\n\nThe doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of\nwhose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him\nup and trying to quiet him.\n\n\"Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!\" his frightened moans\ncould be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.\n\nHearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep.\nWhether because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to\npart with life, or because of those memories of a childhood that could\nnot return, or because he was suffering and others were suffering\nand that man near him was groaning so piteously--he felt like\nweeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears.\n\nThe wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted\nblood and with the boot still on.\n\n\"Oh! Oh, ooh!\" he sobbed, like a woman.\n\nThe doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince\nAndrew from seeing his face, moved away.\n\n\"My God! What is this? Why is he here?\" said Prince Andrew to\nhimself.\n\nIn the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been\namputated, he recognized Anatole Kuragin. Men were supporting him in\ntheir arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling,\nswollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully.\n\"Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully\nconnected with me,\" thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping\nwhat he saw before him. \"What is the connection of that man with my\nchildhood and life?\" he asked himself without finding an answer. And\nsuddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving\nchildhood presented itself to him. He remembered Natasha as he had\nseen her for the first time at the ball in 1810, with her slender neck\nand arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture, and\nlove and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever,\nawoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed\nbetween himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears\nthat filled his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic\npity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.\n\nPrince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender\nloving tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and\ntheir errors.\n\n\"Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for\nthose who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God\npreached on earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not\nunderstand--that is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what\nremained for me had I lived. But now it is too late. I know it!\"');

This day the horrible appearance of the\nbattlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought\nconstituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from the\nbattlefield and returned to the Shevardino knoll, where he sat on\nhis campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his\nnose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast\neyes, to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the\nend of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant\nand which he was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a\nbrief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he\nhad served so long. He felt in his own person the sufferings and death\nhe had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and\nchest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for\nhimself. At that moment he did not desire Moscow, or victory, or glory\n(what need had he for any more glory?). The one thing he wished for\nwas rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he had been on the\nSemenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring\nseveral batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the\nfire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo. Napoleon had\nassented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of\nthe effect those batteries produced.\n\nAn adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns\nhad been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that\nthey still held their ground.\n\n\"Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,\" said\nthe adjutant.\n\n\"They want more!...\" said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Sire?\" asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.\n\n\"They want more!\" croaked Napoleon frowning. \"Let them have it!\"\n\nEven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and\nfor which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of\nhim, was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of\nimaginary greatness, and again--as a horse walking a treadmill\nthinks it is doing something for itself--he submissively fulfilled the\ncruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.\n\nAnd not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience\ndarkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening\nlay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the\nend of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the\nsignificance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and\ntruth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to\ngrasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as\nthey were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth,\ngoodness, and all humanity.\n\nNot only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with\nmen killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as\nhe looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,\ndeceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that\nthere were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone\ndid he write in a letter to Paris that \"the battle field was\nsuperb,\" because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the\nisland of St. Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he\nintended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had\ndone, he wrote:\n\n\nThe Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern\ntimes: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the\ntranquillity and security of all; it was purely pacific and\nconservative.\n\nIt was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the\nbeginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening\nout, full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system\nwas already founded; all that remained was to organize it.\n\nSatisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I\ntoo should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were\nstolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have\ndiscussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account\nto the peoples as clerk to master.\n\nEurope would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people,\nand anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in\nthe common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all\nnavigable rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all,\nand that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to\nmere guards for the sovereigns.\n\nOn returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong,\nmagnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have\nproclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely\ndefensive, all aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated\nmy son in the Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and\nhis constitutional reign would have begun.\n\nParis would have been the capital of the world, and the French the\nenvy of the nations!\n\nMy leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company\nwith the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to\nleisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country\ncouple, every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing\nwrongs, and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all\nsides and everywhere.\n\n\nNapoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of\nexecutioner of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his\nactions had been the peoples\' welfare and that he could control the\nfate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions.\n\n\n\"Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,\" he wrote further\nof the Russian war, \"half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,\nBavarians, Wurttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and\nNeapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third\ncomposed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,\nPiedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the\nThirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on:\nit included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French.\nThe Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand\nmen; the Russian army in its retreat from Vilna to Moscow lost in\nthe various battles four times more men than the French army; the\nburning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who\ndied of cold and want in the woods; finally, in its march from\nMoscow to the Oder the Russian army also suffered from the severity of\nthe season; so that by the time it reached Vilna it numbered\nonly fifty thousand, and at Kalisch less than eighteen thousand.\"\n\n\nHe imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the\nhorrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the\nwhole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found\njustification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who\nperished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.');

At\nthe dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a\nspace of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms,\nwounded and unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves\nback to Mozhaysk from the one army and back to Valuevo from the other.\nOther crowds, exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their\nofficers. Others held their ground and continued to fire.\n\nOver the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter\nof bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now\nspread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of\nsaltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall\non the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, and\nhesitating men, as if to say: \"Enough, men! Enough! Cease... bethink\nyourselves! What are you doing?\"\n\nTo the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,\nit began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to\nslaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the\nquestion arose in every soul: \"For what, for whom, must I kill and\nbe killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don\'t want to\ndo so anymore!\" By evening this thought had ripened in every soul.\nAt any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what\nthey were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away\nanywhere.\n\nBut though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the\nhorror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to\nleave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to\ncontrol them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed,\nand applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of\nevery three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue,\nperspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls flew\njust as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies,\nand that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but\nat the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.\n\nAnyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would\nhave said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it\nwould disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army\nwould have said that the Russians need only make one more slight\neffort and the French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor\nthe Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly\nout.\n\nThe Russians did not make that effort because they were not\nattacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood\nblocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the\nbattle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians\nbeen to drive the French from their positions, they could not have\nmade this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken\nup, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the\nbattle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE\nHALF of their army.\n\nThe French, with the memory of all their former victories during\nfifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon\'s invincibility, with\nthe consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and\nhad lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards\nintact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort.\nThe French who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from\nits position ought to have made that effort, for as long as the\nRussians continued to block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of\nthe French had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were\nin vain. But the French did not make that effort. Some historians say\nthat Napoleon need only have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and\nthe battle would have been won. To speak of what would have happened\nhad Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of what would happen if\nautumn became spring. It could not be. Napoleon did not give his\nGuards, not because he did not want to, but because it could not be\ndone. All the generals, officers, and soldiers of the French army knew\nit could not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops would\nnot permit it.\n\nIt was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling\nof the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and\nsoldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,\nafter all their experience of previous battles--when after one tenth\nof such efforts the enemy had fled--experienced a similar feeling of\nterror before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as\nthreateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The\nmoral force of the attacking French army was exhausted. Not that\nsort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of\nmaterial fastened to sticks, called standards, and of the ground on\nwhich the troops had stood and were standing, but a moral victory that\nconvinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of\nhis own impotence was gained by the Russians at Borodino. The French\ninvaders, like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received\na mortal wound, felt that they were perishing, but could not stop, any\nmore than the Russian army, weaker by one half, could help swerving.\nBy impetus gained, the French army was still able to roll forward to\nMoscow, but there, without further effort on the part of the Russians,\nit had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at\nBorodino. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was\nNapoleon\'s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old\nSmolensk road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred\nthousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at\nBorodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit\nhad been laid.');

Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only\nwhen he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but\nat the same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the\narbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements.\nThere is a well known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in\nthis, that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was\nfollowing, in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast\nas the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the distance that\nseparated him from the tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of\nthat distance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth,\nthe tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so on forever.\nThis problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that\nAchilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that\nmotion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements, whereas\nthe motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.\n\nBy adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only\napproach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we\nhave admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the\nresulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth,\nand have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we reach\na solution of the problem.\n\nA modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing\nwith the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more\ncomplex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.\n\nThis modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when\ndealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the\ninfinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion\n(absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error\nwhich the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements\nof motion instead of examining continuous motion.\n\nIn seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing\nhappens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable\narbitrary human wills, is continuous.\n\nTo understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of\nhistory. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all\nthose human wills, man\'s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected\nunits. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily\nselected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others,\nthough there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event\nalways flows uninterruptedly from another.\n\nThe second method is to consider the actions of some one man--a king\nor a commander--as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills;\nwhereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity\nof a single historic personage.\n\nHistorical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth\ncontinually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But\nhowever small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit\ndisconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any\nphenomenon, or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the\nactions of any one historic personage, is in itself false.\n\nIt needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any\ndeductions drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some\nlarger or smaller unit as the subject of observation--as criticism has\nevery right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must\nalways be arbitrarily selected.\n\nOnly by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the\ndifferential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men)\nand attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum\nof these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.\n\nThe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe\npresent an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave\ntheir customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other,\nplunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair,\nand for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an\nintensive movement which first increases and then slackens. What was\nthe cause of this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the\nmind of man.\n\nThe historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings\nand doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris,\ncalling these sayings and doings \"the Revolution\"; then they give a\ndetailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or\nhostile to him; tell of the influence some of these people had on\nothers, and say: that is why this movement took place and those are\nits laws.\n\nBut the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation,\nbut plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious,\nbecause in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger.\nThe sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and\nonly the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.\n\n\"But every time there have been conquests there have been\nconquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any state\nthere have been great men,\" says history. And, indeed, human reason\nreplies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this\ndoes not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is\npossible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a\nsingle man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten,\nI hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells\nbegin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right\nto assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position\nof the hands of the watch.\n\nWhenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and\nsee the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to\nconclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of\nthe movement of the engine.\n\nThe peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the\noaks are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when\nthe oak is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold\nwinds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the\npeasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold\nwind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I\nsee only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the\nphenomena of life, and I see that however much and however carefully I\nobserve the hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the\nengine, and the oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells\nringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I\nmust entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the\nmovement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do\nthe same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.\n\nTo study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of\nour observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and\nstudy the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses\nare moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance\nin this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is\nevident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering\nthe laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much\nmental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has\nbeen devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,\nand ministers and propounding the historians\' own reflections\nconcerning these actions.');

The\nRussian army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk was reached,\nand again from Smolensk to Borodino. The French army pushed on to\nMoscow, its goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim,\njust as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches\nthe earth. Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken,\nhostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its\ngoal. Every soldier in Napoleon\'s army felt this and the invasion\nmoved on by its own momentum.\n\nThe more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of\nhatred of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army\nincreased and consolidated. At Borodino a collision took place.\nNeither army was broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately\nafter the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding\nwith another having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability\nthe ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on\nfor some distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its\nforce.\n\nThe Russians retreated eighty miles--to beyond Moscow--and the\nFrench reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks\nafter that there was not a single battle. The French did not move.\nAs a bleeding, mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained\ninert in Moscow for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh\nreason, fled back: they made a dash for the Kaluga road, and (after\na victory--for at Malo-Yaroslavets the field of conflict again\nremained theirs) without undertaking a single serious battle, they\nfled still more rapidly back to Smolensk, beyond Smolensk, beyond\nthe Berezina, beyond Vilna, and farther still.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutuzov and the\nwhole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino was a\nvictory. Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare\nfor a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive\nanyone, but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who\nhad taken part in the battle knew it.\n\nBut all that evening and next day reports came in one after\nanother of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a\nfresh battle proved physically impossible.\n\nIt was impossible to give battle before information had been\ncollected, the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition\nreplenished, the slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to\nreplace those who had been killed, and before the men had had food and\nsleep. And meanwhile, the very next morning after the battle, the\nFrench army advanced of itself upon the Russians, carried forward by\nthe force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse\nproportion to the square of the distance from its aim. Kutuzov\'s\nwish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired to do so.\nBut to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there\nmust also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not\nexist. It was impossible not to retreat a day\'s march, and then in the\nsame way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day\'s\nmarch, and at last, on the first of September when the army drew\nnear Moscow--despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in\nall ranks--the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond\nMoscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day\'s march, and\nabandoned Moscow to the enemy.\n\nFor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are\nmade by generals--as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may\nimagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle--the\nquestions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov during the retreat not\ndo this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching\nFili? Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga road, abandoning\nMoscow? and so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or\ndo not know, the inevitable conditions which always limit the\nactivities of any commander in chief. The activity of a commander in\nchief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves\nwhen we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map,\nwith a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain\nknown locality, and begin our plans from some given moment. A\ncommander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any\nevent--the position from which we always contemplate it. The commander\nin chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so\nhe never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that\nis occurring. Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping\nitself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping\nof events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex\nplay of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects,\ncounsels, threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply\nto innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict\nwith one another.\n\nLearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutuzov\nshould have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before reaching\nFili, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But\na commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always\nbefore him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these\nproposals, based on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.\n\nA commander in chief\'s business, it would seem, is simply to\nchoose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and\ntime do not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested\nto him to cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an adjutant\ngallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French\nor retire. An order must be given him at once, that instant. And the\norder to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kaluga road. And\nafter the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the\nstores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where\nthe wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter\nfrom the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of\nabandoning Moscow, and the commander in chief\'s rival, the man who\nis undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several\nsuch), presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning\nto the Kaluga road, and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and\nrefreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has\nbeen overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain,\nand the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an\nofficer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite\ncontrary to what was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a\nprisoner, and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe\nthe position of the enemy\'s army differently. People accustomed to\nmisunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a\ncommander in chief\'s actions describe to us, for instance, the\nposition of the army at Fili and assume that the commander in chief\ncould, on the first of September, quite freely decide whether to\nabandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less\nthan four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that\nquestion been settled? At Drissa and at Smolensk and most palpably\nof all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevardino and on the\ntwenty-sixth at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of the\nretreat from Borodino to Fili.');

Think what you\nare saying!\"\n\nKutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond\nMoscow without a battle.\n\nOn the Poklonny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomilov gate of\nMoscow, Kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the\nroadside. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count\nRostopchin, who had come out from Moscow, joined them. This\nbrilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed\nthe advantages and disadvantages of the position, the state of the\narmy, the plans suggested, the situation of Moscow, and military\nquestions generally. Though they had not been summoned for the\npurpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this\nwas really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public\nquestions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a\nwhisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or\nlaughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They\nevidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the\nsituation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among\nthemselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench\nformed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might\noverhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being\nsaid and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not\nhimself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After\nhearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he\ngenerally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they\nwere not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the\nposition that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself\nso much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others\nargued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should\nhave been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle\nof Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived\nFrenchman in a Spanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one of the\nGerman princes serving with the Russian army were discussing the siege\nof Saragossa and considering the possibility of defending Moscow in\na similar manner.) Count Rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he\nwas prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the\ncapital, but that he still could not help regretting having been\nleft in ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it\nsooner things would have been different.... A fifth group,\ndisplaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed\nthe direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group was\ntalking absolute nonsense. Kutuzov\'s expression grew more and more\npreoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that\nto defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of\nthose words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any\nsenseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would\nresult but the battle would still not take place. It would not take\nplace because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to\nbe impossible, but in their conversations were only discussing what\nwould happen after its inevitable abandonment. How could the\ncommanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered\nimpossible to hold? The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers\n(who too reason) also considered the position impossible and therefore\ncould not go to fight, fully convinced as they were of defeat. If\nBennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still\ndiscussed it, the question was no longer important in itself but\nonly as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This Kutuzov knew well.\n\nBennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian\npatriotism (Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing) by\ninsisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as\ndaylight to Kutuzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on\nKutuzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without\ngiving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if\nbattle were not given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning\nMoscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man\'s mind. One\nterrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no\nreply from anyone. The question for him now was: \"Have I really\nallowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it\ndecided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Platov to\nretreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told\nBennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when\nwas this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army\nmust retreat and the order to do so must be given.\" To give that\nterrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of\nthe army. And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed\n(the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovski, under whom he had served\nin Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to\nsave Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor\'s wish and by\nthe will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief. He\nwas convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in\nthese difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he alone\ncould encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and he was\nhorrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something\nhad to be decided, and these conversations around him which were\nassuming too free a character must be stopped.\n\nHe called the most important generals to him.\n\n\"My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,\" said he, rising\nfrom the bench, and he rode to Fili where his carriages were waiting.');

Malasha looked down from the oven\nwith shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and decorations of the\ngenerals, who one after another came into the room and sat down on the\nbroad benches in the corner under the icons. \"Granddad\" himself, as\nMalasha in her own mind called Kutuzov, sat apart in a dark corner\nbehind the oven. He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and\ncontinually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat\nwhich, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those\nwho entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the\nhands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kaysarov was about to\ndraw back the curtain of the window facing Kutuzov, but the latter\nmoved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood that his Serene\nHighness did not wish his face to be seen.\n\nRound the peasant\'s deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils,\nand papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in\nanother bench and put it beside the table. Ermolov, Kaysarov, and\nToll, who had just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost\nplace, immediately under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high\nforehead merging into his bald crown. He had a St. George\'s Cross\nround his neck and looked pale and ill. He had been feverish for two\ndays and was now shivering and in pain. Beside him sat Uvarov, who\nwith rapid gesticulations was giving him some information, speaking in\nlow tones as they all did. Chubby little Dokhturov was listening\nattentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach. On\nthe other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolstoy, seemingly absorbed in\nhis own thoughts. His broad head with its bold features and glittering\neyes was resting on his hand. Raevski, twitching forward the black\nhair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kutuzov and now\nat the door with a look of impatience. Konovnitsyn\'s firm, handsome,\nand kindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met\nMalasha\'s, and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to\nsmile.\n\nThey were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of\ninspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited\nfor him from four till six o\'clock and did not begin their\ndeliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters.\n\nOnly when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutuzov leave his corner\nand draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that\nhad been placed there to light up his face.\n\nBennigsen opened the council with the question: \"Are we to abandon\nRussia\'s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to\ndefend it?\" A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a\nfrown on every face and only Kutuzov\'s angry grunts and occasional\ncough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malasha too\nlooked at \"Granddad.\" She was nearest to him and saw how his face\npuckered; he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.\n\n\"Russia\'s ancient and sacred capital!\" he suddenly said, repeating\nBennigsen\'s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to\nthe false note in them. \"Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that\nthat question has no meaning for a Russian.\" (He lurched his heavy\nbody forward.) \"Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The\nquestion I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military\none. The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up\nMoscow without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the\narmy as well as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your\nopinion,\" and he sank back in his chair.\n\nThe discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game\nlost. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle\nat Fili was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the\nlove of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the\nleft flank during the night and attack the French right flank the\nfollowing day. Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced\nfor and against that project. Ermolov, Dokhturov, and Raevski agreed\nwith Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice\nbefore abandoning the capital or guided by other, personal\nconsiderations, these generals seemed not to understand that this\ncouncil could not alter the inevitable course of events and that\nMoscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, however,\nunderstood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, spoke of the\ndirection the army should take in its retreat. Malasha, who kept her\neyes fixed on what was going on before her, understood the meaning\nof the council differently. It seemed to her that it was only a\npersonal struggle between \"Granddad\" and \"Long-coat\" as she termed\nBennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one\nanother, and in her heart she sided with \"Granddad.\" In the midst of\nthe conversation she noticed \"Granddad\" give Bennigsen a quick, subtle\nglance, and then to her joys he saw that \"Granddad\" said something\nto \"Long-coat\" which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and\npaced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kutuzov\'s\ncalm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen\'s\nproposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to\nattack the French right wing.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Kutuzov, \"I cannot approve of the count\'s plan.\nMoving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous,\nand military history supports that view. For instance...\" Kutuzov\nseemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear,\nnaive look at Bennigsen he added: \"Oh yes; take the battle of\nFriedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was...\nnot fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near\nthe enemy...\"\n\nThere followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them\nall.\n\nThe discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and\nthey all felt that there was no more to be said.\n\nDuring one of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if\npreparing to speak. They all looked at him.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the\nbroken crockery,\" said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table.\n\"Gentlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with\nme. But I,\" he paused, \"by the authority entrusted to me by my\nSovereign and country, order a retreat.\"\n\nAfter that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and\ncircumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.\n\nSome of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different\nfrom the way they had spoken during the council, communicated\nsomething to their commander in chief.\n\nMalasha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully\nbackwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its\nprojections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she\ndarted out of the room.\n\nWhen he had dismissed the generals Kutuzov sat a long time with\nhis elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible\nquestion: \"When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable?\nWhen was that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame\nfor it?\"\n\n\"I did not expect this,\" said he to his adjutant Schneider when\nthe latter came in late that night. \"I did not expect this! I did\nnot think this would happen.\"\n\n\"You should take some rest, your Serene Highness,\" replied\nSchneider.\n\n\"But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!\" exclaimed\nKutuzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist.\n\"They shall too, if only...\"');

The\npeople awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited\nor tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the\nstrength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment.\nAnd as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away\nabandoning their property, while the poorer remained and burned and\ndestroyed what was left.\n\nThe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was\nand is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of\nthis, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in\nRussian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already\nin July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this.\nThose who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their\nhouses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism\nwhich expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one\'s children to\nsave the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively,\nsimply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the\nmost powerful results.\n\n\"It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running\naway from Moscow,\" they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchin\nimpressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed\nto be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing\nit had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that\nRostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had\ncommitted in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the\nrich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had\nremained intact and that during Napoleon\'s occupation the\ninhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the\ncharming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially the Russian\nladies, then liked so much.\n\nThey went away because for Russians there could be no question as to\nwhether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It\nwas out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst\nthing that could happen. They went away even before the battle of\nBorodino and still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchin\'s calls\nto defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the\nwonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or\nof the balloons that were to destroy the French, and despite all the\nnonsense Rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets. They knew that it was\nfor the army to fight, and that if it could not succeed it would not\ndo to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter\nof Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that they must go away, sorry as they\nwere to abandon their property to destruction. They went away\nwithout thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and\nwealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with\nwooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be\nburned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was only in\nconsequence of their going away that the momentous event was\naccomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian\npeople. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchin\'s\norders, had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women\njesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate, with a vague\nconsciousness that she was not Bonaparte\'s servant, was really,\nsimply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia.\nBut Count Rostopchin, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now\nhad the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless\nweapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the\nicons, and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics\nof saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one\nhundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being\nconstructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and\nrelated how he had set fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation\nto the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his\nOrphanage; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn\nMoscow and now repudiated the deed; now ordered the people to catch\nall spies and bring them to him, and now reproached them for doing so;\nnow expelled all the French residents from Moscow, and now allowed\nMadame Aubert-Chalme (the center of the whole French colony in Moscow)\nto remain, but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyucharev to be\narrested and exiled for no particular offense; now assembled the\npeople at the Three Hills to fight the French and now, to get rid of\nthem, handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by\na back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of\nMoscow, and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share\nin the affair--this man did not understand the meaning of what was\nhappening but merely wanted to do something himself that would\nastonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a\nchild he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event--the\nabandonment and burning of Moscow--and tried with his puny hand now to\nspeed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him along\nwith it.');

In Vilna she\nhad formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she\nreturned to Petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there, and\nboth claimed their rights. Helene was faced by a new problem--how to\npreserve her intimacy with both without offending either.\n\nWhat would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman\ndid not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezukhova, who\nevidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had\nshe attempted concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her\nawkward position by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by\nacknowledging herself guilty. But Helene, like a really great man\nwho can do whatever he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be\ncorrect, as she sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else\nwas to blame.\n\nThe first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach\nher, she lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said\nfirmly: \"That\'s just like a man--selfish and cruel! I expected nothing\nelse. A woman sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her\nreward! What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my\nattachments and friendships? He is a man who has been more than a\nfather to me!\" The prince was about to say something, but Helene\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" said she, \"it may be that he has other sentiments for\nme than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut\nmy door on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with\ningratitude! Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my\nintimate feelings I render account only to God and to my\nconscience,\" she concluded, laying her hand on her beautiful, fully\nexpanded bosom and looking up to heaven.\n\n\"But for heaven\'s sake listen to me!\"\n\n\"Marry me, and I will be your slave!\"\n\n\"But that\'s impossible.\"\n\n\"You won\'t deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...\" said\nHelene, beginning to cry.\n\nThe prince tried to comfort her, but Helene, as if quite distraught,\nsaid through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,\nthat there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but\nshe mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she\nhad never been her husband\'s wife, and that she had been sacrificed.\n\n\"But the law, religion...\" said the prince, already yielding.\n\n\"The law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can\'t\narrange that?\" said Helene.\n\nThe prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred\nto him, and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the\nSociety of Jesus, with whom he was on intimate terms.\n\nA few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Helene\ngave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur\nde Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant\nblack eyes, a Jesuit a robe courte* was presented to her, and in the\ngarden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music\ntalked to her for a long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the\nSacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion\naffords in this world and the next. Helene was touched, and more\nthan once tears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur de Jobert\nand their voices trembled. A dance, for which her partner came to seek\nher, put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de\nconscience, but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to see Helene\nwhen she was alone, and after that often came again.\n\n\n*Lay member of the Society of Jesus.\n\n\nOne day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she\nknelt down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting,\nmiddle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself\nafterward described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze\nwafted into her soul. It was explained to her that this was la grace.\n\nAfter that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her. She confessed\nto him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box\ncontaining the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to\npartake of. A few days later Helene learned with pleasure that she had\nnow been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days\nthe Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain\ndocument.\n\nAll that was done around her and to her at this time, all the\nattention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such\npleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now\nin (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave\nher pleasure, but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to\nforget her aim. And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a\nstupid person gets the better of cleverer ones, Helene--having\nrealized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble\nwas, after converting her to Catholicism, to obtain money from her for\nJesuit institutions (as to which she received indications)-before\nparting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary\nto free her from her husband should be performed. In her view the aim\nof every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while\naffording satisfaction to human desires. And with this aim, in one of\nher talks with her Father Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the\nquestion, in how far was she bound by her marriage?\n\nThey were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.\nThe scent of flowers came in at the window. Helene was wearing a white\ndress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbe, a\nwell-fed man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth,\nand white hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Helene and,\nwith a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at\nher beauty, occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his\nopinion on the subject. Helene with an uneasy smile looked at his\ncurly hair and his plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every\nmoment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbe,\nthough he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was\nabsorbed in his mastery of the matter.\n\nThe course of the Father Confessor\'s arguments ran as follows:\n\"Ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow\nof conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married\nstate without faith in the religious significance of marriage,\ncommitted an act of sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual\nsignificance it should have had. Yet in spite of this your vow was\nbinding. You swerved from it. What did you commit by so acting? A\nvenial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you acted without evil\nintention. If now you married again with the object of bearing\nchildren, your sin might be forgiven. But the question is again a\ntwofold one: firstly...\"\n\nBut suddenly Helene, who was getting bored, said with one of her\nbewitching smiles: \"But I think that having espoused the true religion\nI cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.\"\n\nThe director of her conscience was astounded at having the case\npresented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus\' egg. He was\ndelighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil\'s progress, but\ncould not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously\nconstructed.\n\n\"Let us understand one another, Countess,\" said he with a smile, and\nbegan refuting his spiritual daughter\'s arguments.');

She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him\nwhat she had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so\nthat the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her.\nThe elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this\nsuggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive, as the\nyounger man had been, but Helene\'s imperturbable conviction that it\nwas as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him\ntoo. Had Helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation, shame,\nor secrecy, her cause would certainly have been lost; but not only did\nshe show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the contrary, with\ngood-natured naivete she told her intimate friends (and these were all\nPetersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her\nand that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.\n\nA rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Helene wanted\nto be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would\nhave opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the\nunfortunate and interesting Helene was in doubt which of the two men\nshe should marry. The question was no longer whether this was\npossible, but only which was the better match and how the matter would\nbe regarded at court. There were, it is true, some rigid individuals\nunable to rise to the height of such a question, who saw in the\nproject a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, but there were not\nmany such and they remained silent, while the majority were interested\nin Helene\'s good fortune and in the question which match would be\nthe more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to remarry\nwhile one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question\nhad evidently been settled by people \"wiser than you or me,\" as they\nsaid, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk\nexposing one\'s stupidity and incapacity to live in society.\n\nOnly Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had come to Petersburg that\nsummer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an\nopinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Helene at a ball she\nstopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence,\nsaid in her gruff voice: \"So wives of living men have started marrying\nagain! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been\nforestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all\nthe brothels,\" and with these words Marya Dmitrievna, turning up her\nwide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly\nround, moved across the room.\n\nThough people were afraid of Marya Dmitrievna she was regarded in\nPetersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only\nnoticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had\nused, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.\n\nPrince Vasili, who of late very often forgot what he had said and\nrepeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his\ndaughter whenever he chanced to see her:\n\n\"Helene, I have a word to say to you,\" and he would lead her\naside, drawing her hand downward. \"I have heard of certain projects\nconcerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father\'s\nheart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much....\nBut, my dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to\nsay,\" and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek\nagainst his daughter\'s and move away.\n\nBilibin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,\nand who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as\nHelene always has--men friends who can never change into lovers--once\ngave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.\n\n\"Listen, Bilibin,\" said Helene (she always called friends of that\nsort by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her\nwhite, beringed fingers. \"Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought\nto do. Which of the two?\"\n\nBilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with\na smile on his lips.\n\n\"You are not taking me unawares, you know,\" said he. \"As a true\nfriend, I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see,\nif you marry the prince\"--he meant the younger man--and he crooked one\nfinger, \"you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you\nwill displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of\nconnection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last\ndays happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be\nmaking a mesalliance by marrying you,\" and Bilibin smoothed out his\nforehead.\n\n\"That\'s a true friend!\" said Helene beaming, and again touching\nBilibin\'s sleeve. \"But I love them, you know, and don\'t want to\ndistress either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of\nthem both.\"\n\nBilibin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he\ncould help in that difficulty.\n\n\"Une maitresse-femme!* That\'s what is called putting things\nsquarely. She would like to be married to all three at the same time,\"\nthought he.\n\n\n*A masterly woman.\n\n\n\"But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?\" Bilibin\nasked, his reputation being so well established that he did not fear\nto ask so naive a question. \"Will he agree?\"\n\n\"Oh, he loves me so!\" said Helene, who for some reason imagined that\nPierre too loved her. \"He will do anything for me.\"\n\nBilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.\n\n\"Even divorce you?\" said he.\n\nHelene laughed.\n\nAmong those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed\nmarriage was Helene\'s mother, Princess Kuragina. She was continually\ntormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned\na subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to\nthe idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of\ndivorce and remarriage during a husband\'s lifetime, and the priest\ntold her that it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text\nin the Gospel which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage\nwhile the husband is alive.\n\nArmed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable,\nshe drove to her daughter\'s early one morning so as to find her alone.\n\nHaving listened to her mother\'s objections, Helene smiled blandly\nand ironically.\n\n\"But it says plainly: \'Whosoever shall marry her that is\ndivorced...\'\" said the old princess.\n\n\"Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de betises. Vous ne comprenez rein. Dans ma\nposition j\'ai des devoirs,\"* said Helene changing from Russian, in\nwhich language she always felt that her case did not sound quite\nclear, into French which suited it better.\n\n\n*\"Oh, Mamma, don\'t talk nonsense! You don\'t understand anything.\nIn my position I have obligations.\"\n\n\n\"But, my dear....\"\n\n\"Oh, Mamma, how is it you don\'t understand that the Holy Father, who\nhas the right to grant dispensations...\"\n\nJust then the lady companion who lived with Helene came in to\nannounce that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.\n\n\"Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse\ncontre lui, parce qu\'il m\'a manque parole.\"*\n\n\n*\"No, tell him I don\'t wish to see him, I am furious with him for\nnot keeping his word to me.\"\n\n\n\"Comtesse, a tout peche misericorde,\"* said a fair-haired young\nman with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.\n\n\n*\"Countess, there is mercy for every sin.\"\n\n\nThe old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who\nhad entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter\nand sidled out of the room.\n\n\"Yes, she is right,\" thought the old princess, all her convictions\ndissipated by the appearance of His Highness. \"She is right, but how\nis it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so\nsimple,\" she thought as she got into her carriage.\n\n\nBy the beginning of August Helene\'s affairs were clearly defined and\nshe wrote a letter to her husband--who, as she imagined, loved her\nvery much--informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her\nhaving embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all\nthe formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to\nhim by the bearer of the letter.\n\n\nAnd so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful\nkeeping--Your friend Helene.\n\n\nThis letter was brought to Pierre\'s house when he was on the field\nof Borodino.');

There were still the same suffering,\nexhausted, and sometimes strangely indifferent faces, the same\nblood, the same soldiers\' overcoats, the same sounds of firing\nwhich, though distant now, still aroused terror, and besides this\nthere were the foul air and the dust.\n\nHaving gone a couple of miles along the Mozhaysk road, Pierre sat\ndown by the roadside.\n\nDusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay\nleaning on his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved\npast him in the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon\nball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he\nshuddered and sat up. He had no idea how long he had been there. In\nthe middle of the night three soldiers, having brought some\nfirewood, settled down near him and began lighting a fire.\n\nThe soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire\nto burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some\ndried bread and put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy\nviands mingled with the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed.\nThe three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves, taking no\nnotice of him.\n\n\"And who may you be?\" one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently\nmeaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: \"If you want to eat\nwe\'ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest\nman.\"\n\n\"I, I...\" said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social\nposition as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and\nbetter understood by them. \"By rights I am a militia officer, but my\nmen are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.\"\n\n\"There now!\" said one of the soldiers.\n\nAnother shook his head.\n\n\"Would you like a little mash?\" the first soldier asked, and\nhanded Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.\n\nPierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called\nthe food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any\nfood he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping\nhimself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was\nlit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.\n\n\"Where have you to go to? Tell us!\" said one of them.\n\n\"To Mozhaysk.\"\n\n\"You\'re a gentleman, aren\'t you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what\'s your name?\"\n\n\"Peter Kirilych.\"\n\n\"Well then, Peter Kirilych, come along with us, we\'ll take you\nthere.\"\n\nIn the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozhaysk.\n\nBy the time they got near Mozhaysk and began ascending the steep\nhill into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on\nwith the soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom\nof the hill and that he had already passed it. He would not soon\nhave remembered this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he\nnot halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to\nlook for him in the town and was returning to the inn. The groom\nrecognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat.\n\n\"Your excellency!\" he said. \"Why, we were beginning to despair!\nHow is it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Pierre.\n\nThe soldiers stopped.\n\n\"So you\'ve found your folk?\" said one of them. \"Well, good-by, Peter\nKirilych--isn\'t it?\"\n\n\"Good-by, Peter Kirilych!\" Pierre heard the other voices repeat.\n\n\"Good-by!\" he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.\n\n\"I ought to give them something!\" he thought, and felt in his\npocket. \"No, better not!\" said another, inner voice.\n\nThere was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.\nPierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all,\nlay down in his carriage.');

Filled with fright he\nopened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was\ntranquil in the yard. Only someone\'s orderly passed through the\ngateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above\nPierre\'s head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement he had made in\nsitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse. The\nwhole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable\nyards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear\nstarry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.\n\n\"Thank God, there is no more of that!\" he thought, covering up his\nhead again. \"Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I\nyielded to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time,\nto the end...\" thought he.\n\nThey, in Pierre\'s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the\nbattery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before\nthe icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood\nout clearly and sharply from everyone else.\n\n\"To be a soldier, just a soldier!\" thought Pierre as he fell asleep,\n\"to enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them\nwhat they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden\nof my outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could\nhave run away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been\nsent to serve as a soldier after the duel with Dolokhov.\" And the\nmemory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged\nDolokhov flashed through Pierre\'s mind, and then he remembered his\nbenefactor at Torzhok. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the\nlodge presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English\nClub and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table.\n\"Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!\" thought Pierre.\n\"Yes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I am that he\ndied, and how glad I am that he is alive again!\" On one side of the\ntable sat Anatole, Dolokhov, Nesvitski, Denisov, and others like\nthem (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as\nclearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed\nthey), and he heard those people, Anatole and Dolokhov, shouting and\nsinging loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor\nwas heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as\nweighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but\npleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor\nwas saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite\ndistinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the\npossibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,\nfirm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they\nwere kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him.\nWishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at\nthat moment his legs grew cold and bare.\n\nHe felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his\ncloak had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his\ncloak Pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs,\nposts, and yard, but now they were all bluish, lit up, and\nglittering with frost or dew.\n\n\"It is dawn,\" thought Pierre. \"But that\'s not what I want. I want to\nhear and understand my benefactor\'s words.\" Again he covered himself\nup with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was\nthere. There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts\nthat someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.\n\nAfterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that\nsomeone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of\nthat day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to\nthink and express his thoughts like that when awake.\n\n\"To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man\'s\nfreedom to the law of God,\" the voice had said. \"Simplicity is\nsubmission to the will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they\nare simple. They do not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but\nthe unspoken is golden. Man can be master of nothing while he fears\ndeath, but he who does not fear it possesses all. If there were no\nsuffering, man would not know his limitations, would not know himself.\nThe hardest thing [Pierre went on thinking, or hearing, in his\ndream] is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all. To\nunite all?\" he asked himself. \"No, not to unite. Thoughts cannot be\nunited, but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need!\nYes, one must harness them, must harness them!\" he repeated to himself\nwith inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone expressed\nwhat he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him.\n\n\"Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.\"\n\n\"Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your\nexcellency!\" some voice was repeating. \"We must harness, it is time to\nharness....\"\n\nIt was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone\nstraight into Pierre\'s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the\nmiddle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump\nwhile carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with\nrepugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage\nseat. \"No, I don\'t want that, I don\'t want to see and understand that.\nI want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream.\nOne second more and I should have understood it all! But what am I\nto do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?\" and Pierre felt\nwith horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the\ndream had been destroyed.\n\nThe groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an\nofficer had come with news that the French were already near\nMozhaysk and that our men were leaving it.\n\nPierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him,\nwent on foot through the town.\n\nThe troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind\nthem. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses,\nand the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts\nthat were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and\nblows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which\nhad overtaken him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him\nto Moscow. On the way Pierre was told of the death of his\nbrother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew.');

Close to the\ngates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchin\'s adjutant.\n\n\"We have been looking for you everywhere,\" said the adjutant. \"The\ncount wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at\nonce on a very important matter.\"\n\nWithout going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow\ncommander in chief.\n\nCount Rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his\nsummer villa at Sokolniki. The anteroom and reception room of his\nhouse were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for\norders. Vasilchikov and Platov had already seen the count and\nexplained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it\nwould have to be surrendered. Though this news was being concealed\nfrom the inhabitants, the officials--the heads of the various\ngovernment departments--knew that Moscow would soon be in the\nenemy\'s hands, just as Count Rostopchin himself knew it, and to escape\npersonal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how\nthey were to deal with their various departments.\n\nAs Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army\ncame out of Rostopchin\'s private room.\n\nIn answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a\ndespairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.\n\nWhile waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched\nthe various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who\nwere there. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to\na group of men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they\ncontinued their conversation.\n\n\"If they\'re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no\nharm, but as things are now one can\'t answer for anything.\"\n\n\"But you see what he writes...\" said another, pointing to a\nprinted sheet he held in his hand.\n\n\"That\'s another matter. That\'s necessary for the people,\" said the\nfirst.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Oh, it\'s a fresh broadsheet.\"\n\nPierre took it and began reading.\n\n\nHis Serene Highness has passed through Mozhaysk in order to join\nup with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong\nposition where the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty eight guns\nwith ammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene\nHighness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is\neven ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that\nthe law courts are closed; things have to be put in order, and we will\ndeal with villains in our own way! When the time comes I shall want\nboth town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two\nbeforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will\nbe useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be\nbest of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow\nafter dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the\nwounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water\nblessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now:\none of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both.\n\n\n\"But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the\ntown,\" said Pierre, \"and that the position...\"\n\n\"Well, of course! That\'s what we were saying,\" replied the first\nspeaker.\n\n\"And what does he mean by \'One of my eyes was sore but now I am on\nthe lookout with both\'?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"The count had a sty,\" replied the adjutant smiling, \"and was very\nmuch upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the\nmatter with him. By the by, Count,\" he added suddenly, addressing\nPierre with a smile, \"we heard that you have family troubles and\nthat the countess, your wife...\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing,\" Pierre replied unconcernedly. \"But what have\nyou heard?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I\nheard.\"\n\n\"But what did you hear?\"\n\n\"Well, they say,\" continued the adjutant with the same smile,\n\"that the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect\nit\'s nonsense....\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. \"And\nwho is that?\" he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue\npeasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy\nface.\n\n\"He? That\'s a tradesman, that is to say, he\'s the restaurant keeper,\nVereshchagin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the\nproclamation.\"\n\n\"Oh, so that is Vereshchagin!\" said Pierre, looking at the firm,\ncalm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a\ntraitor.\n\n\"That\'s not he himself, that\'s the father of the fellow who wrote\nthe proclamation,\" said the adjutant. \"The young man is in prison\nand I expect it will go hard with him.\"\n\nAn old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German\nwearing a cross round his neck, approached the speaker.\n\n\"It\'s a complicated story, you know,\" said the adjutant. \"That\nproclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed\nof it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivanovich\nhere made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly\nsixty-three hands. He asked one, \'From whom did you get it?\' \'From\nso-and-so.\' He went to the next one. \'From whom did you get it?\' and\nso on till he reached Vereshchagin, a half educated tradesman, you\nknow, \'a pet of a trader,\'\" said the adjutant smiling. \"They asked\nhim, \'Who gave it you?\' And the point is that we knew whom he had it\nfrom. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently\nthey had come to some understanding. He replied: \'From no one; I\nmade it up myself.\' They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck\nto that: \'I made it up myself.\' And so it was reported to the count,\nwho sent for the man. \'From whom did you get the proclamation?\' \'I\nwrote it myself.\' Well, you know the count,\" said the adjutant\ncheerfully, with a smile of pride, \"he flared up dreadfully--and\njust think of the fellow\'s audacity, lying, and obstinacy!\"\n\n \"And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharev? I\nunderstand!\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Not at all,\" rejoined the adjutant in dismay. \"Klyucharev had his\nown sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been\nbanished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. \'How could\nyou have written it yourself?\' said he, and he took up the Hamburg\nGazette that was lying on the table. \'Here it is! You did not write it\nyourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because\nyou don\'t even know French, you fool.\' And what do you think? \'No,\'\nsaid he, \'I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.\' \'If that\'s\nso, you\'re a traitor and I\'ll have you tried, and you\'ll be hanged!\nSay from whom you had it.\' \'I have seen no papers, I made it up\nmyself.\' And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched,\nbut the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to\nhard labor, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him.\nBut he\'s a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman\'s\nson, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere\nand imagines that the devil is no match for him. That\'s the sort of\nfellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge,\nand you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a\nscepter in one hand and an orb in the other.

But\nthat\'s not the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to\nthe Masons?\" he went on severely, as though there were something wrong\nabout it which he nevertheless intended to pardon.

Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of\nthese questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these\npeople.

Suffering is necessary...\nthe meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting\nmarried... One must forget and understand...\" And going to his bed\nhe threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that\na special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count\nRostopchin to know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving\nthe town.\n\nA dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in\nthe drawing room.

The thought that both her sons were at the war,\nhad both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or\nboth of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her\nacquaintances, struck her that summer for the first time with cruel\nclearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to\njoin Petya, or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but\nneither of these proved possible. Petya could not return unless his\nregiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on\nactive service. Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent\na word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed account\nof his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not sleep at\nnight, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying\ndead. After many consultations and conversations, the count at last\ndevised means to tranquillize her. He got Petya transferred from\nObolenski\'s regiment to Bezukhov\'s, which was in training near Moscow.\nThough Petya would remain in the service, this transfer would give the\ncountess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her\nwing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her Petya so as not to let\nhim go again, but always get him appointed to places where he could\nnot possibly take part in a battle. As long as Nicholas alone was in\ndanger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than\nall her other children and even reproached herself for it; but when\nher youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always\nbreaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to\neverybody, that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black eyes and fresh\nrosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show--when he was\nthrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere\nabout something and apparently finding pleasure in it--then his mother\nthought she loved him more, much more, than all her other children.\nThe nearer the time came for Petya to return, the more uneasy grew the\ncountess. She began to think she would never live to see such\nhappiness. The presence of Sonya, of her beloved Natasha, or even of\nher husband irritated her. \"What do I want with them? I want no one\nbut Petya,\" she thought.\n\nAt the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from\nNicholas. He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had been\nsent to procure remounts, but that letter did not set the countess\nat ease. Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more\nanxious about Petya.\n\nThough by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs\'\nacquaintances had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to\npersuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible, she would\nnot hear of leaving before her treasure, her adored Petya, returned.\nOn the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness\nwith which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old\nofficer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him\nunder her wing, Petya guessed her designs, and instinctively fearing\nthat he might give way to emotion when with her--might \"become\nwomanish\" as he termed it to himself--he treated her coldly, avoided\nher, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to\nNatasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly\ntenderness, almost lover-like.\n\nOwing to the count\'s customary carelessness nothing was ready for\ntheir departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were\nto come from their Ryazan and Moscow estates to remove their household\nbelongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.\n\nFrom the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a\nbustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodino\nwere brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts\nof Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their\npossessions out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopchin\'s\nbroadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the\nstrangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some\nsaid that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the\ncontrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches\nand everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had been\nanother battle after Borodino at which the French had been routed,\nwhile others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been\ndestroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the\nclergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin\nhad been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the\npeasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and\nso on. But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of\nFili, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been\nheld) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt,\nthough they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned,\nand that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save\ntheir belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break\nup and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.\nAs a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die\nimmediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is\nawry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,\nthough it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the\nconditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would\nbe completely upset.\n\nDuring the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole\nRostov family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the\nfamily, Count Ilya Rostov, continually drove about the city collecting\nthe current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty\norders at home about the preparations for their departure.\n\nThe countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied\nwith everything, was constantly in pursuit of Petya who was always\nrunning away from her, and was jealous of Natasha with whom he spent\nall his time. Sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by\ngetting things packed. But of late Sonya had been particularly sad and\nsilent. Nicholas\' letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had\nelicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who\nsaw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess\nand Nicholas.\n\n\"I was never pleased at Bolkonski\'s engagement to Natasha,\" said the\ncountess, \"but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had\na presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!\"\n\nSonya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of\nretrieving the Rostovs\' affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman,\nand that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her.\nBut despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on\nherself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of\ntheir things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess\nturned to her when they had any orders to give. Petya and Natasha on\nthe contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a\nnuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long the house\nresounded with their running feet, their cries, and their\nspontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there\nwas any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their\nhearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and\nlaughter to them. Petya was in high spirits because having left home a\nboy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man,\nbecause he was at home, because he had left Belaya Tserkov where there\nwas no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow\nwhere there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because\nNatasha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natasha\nwas gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her\nof the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was\nalso happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of\nothers was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them\nrun freely--and Petya adored her. Above all, they were gay because\nthere was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town\ngates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping--going away\nsomewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and\nthat is always exciting, especially to the young.');

All the doors were open, all the\nfurniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and\npictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay,\nwrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house\nserfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet\nfloors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high\nand already corded up, others still empty.\n\nThe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants\nwho had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another\nin the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning.\nThe countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil\nand was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress\non her head. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with\nwhom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active\narmy. Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass\nand china. Natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room\nwith dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing\nfixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress\n(already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg\nball.\n\nNatasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy,\nand several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart\nwas not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything\nexcept with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood\nbeside Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but\nsoon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At\nfirst she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the\nmaids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be\npacked, she found it dull.\n\n\"Dunyasha, you pack! You will, won\'t you, dear?\" And when Dunyasha\nwillingly promised to do it all for her, Natasha sat down on the\nfloor, took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite\nunrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was\nroused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room\n(which was theirs) and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going\nto the back porch. Natasha got up and looked out of the window. An\nenormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the\nstreet.\n\nThe housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,\npostilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.\n\nNatasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and\nholding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.\n\nThe former housekeeper, old Mavra Kuzminichna, had stepped out of\nthe crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of\nbast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.\nNatasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her\nhandkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.\n\n\"Then you have nobody in Moscow?\" she was saying. \"You would be more\ncomfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the\nfamily are leaving.\"\n\n\"I don\'t know if it would be allowed,\" replied the officer in a weak\nvoice. \"Here is our commanding officer... ask him,\" and he pointed\nto a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of\ncarts.\n\nNatasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded\nofficer and at once went to meet the major.\n\n\"May the wounded men stay in our house?\" she asked.\n\nThe major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.\n\n\"Which one do you want, Ma\'am\'selle?\" said he, screwing up his\neyes and smiling.\n\nNatasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner\nwere so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her\nhandkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some\nreflection--as if considering in how far the thing was possible--replied\nin the affirmative.\n\n\"Oh yes, why not? They may,\" he said.\n\nWith a slight inclination of her head, Natasha stepped back\nquickly to Mavra Kuzminichna, who stood talking compassionately to the\nofficer.\n\n\"They may. He says they may!\" whispered Natasha.\n\nThe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostovs\' yard,\nand dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the\ntownsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of\nthe houses in Povarskaya Street. Natasha was evidently pleased to be\ndealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life.\nShe and Mavra Kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as\npossible into their yard.\n\n\"Your Papa must be told, though,\" said Mavra Kuzminichna.\n\n\"Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can\nmove into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.\"\n\n\"There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if\nwe put them into the wing, the men\'s room, or the nurse\'s room, we\nmust ask permission.\"\n\n\"Well, I\'ll ask.\"\n\nNatasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the\nhalf-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell of\nvinegar and Hoffman\'s drops.\n\n\"Are you asleep, Mamma?\"\n\n\"Oh, what sleep-?\" said the countess, waking up just as she was\ndropping into a doze.\n\n\"Mamma darling!\" said Natasha, kneeling by her mother and bringing\nher face close to her mother\'s, \"I am sorry, forgive me, I\'ll never do\nit again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna has sent me: they have\nbrought some wounded here--officers. Will you let them come? They have\nnowhere to go. I knew you\'d let them come!\" she said quickly all in\none breath.\n\n\"What officers? Whom have they brought? I don\'t understand\nanything about it,\" said the countess.\n\nNatasha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.\n\n\"I knew you\'d give permission... so I\'ll tell them,\" and, having\nkissed her mother, Natasha got up and went to the door.\n\nIn the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.\n\n\"We\'ve stayed too long!\" said the count with involuntary vexation.\n\"The Club is closed and the police are leaving.\"\n\n\"Papa, is it all right--I\'ve invited some of the wounded into the\nhouse?\" said Natasha.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" he answered absently. \"That\'s not the point. I\nbeg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and\ntomorrow we must go, go, go!....\"\n\nAnd the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the\nservants.\n\nAt dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had\nheard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and\nthat though Rostopchin\'s broadsheet had said that he would sound a\ncall two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already\nbeen given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and\nthat there would be a big battle there.\n\nThe countess looked with timid horror at her son\'s eager, excited\nface as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his\nnot going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the\nimpending engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the\nfatherland--something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which\nthere would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and\nso, hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her\nas their protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after\ndinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take\nher away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman\'s\ninvoluntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm,\nsaid that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very\nnight. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.');

When returning by that street she had\nbeen unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the\nshop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the\ncabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels\nat the drink store, having received orders to do so.\n\nAfter dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with\nenthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their\ndeparture. The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing\nfrom the yard to the house and back again, shouting confused\ninstructions to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more.\nPetya directed things in the yard. Sonya, owing to the count\'s\ncontradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The\nservants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing.\nNatasha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set\nto work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing\nwas received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and\ndid not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded\nobedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed\nher, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first\nexploit, which cost her immense effort and established her\nauthority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable\nGobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha\nset to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost\nfull up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much\nchina standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from\nthe storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to\nfetch it.\n\n\"Sonya, wait a bit--we\'ll pack everything into these,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"You can\'t, Miss, we have tried to,\" said the butler\'s assistant.\n\n\"No, wait a minute, please.\"\n\nAnd Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates\nwrapped in paper.\n\n\"The dishes must go in here among the carpets,\" said she.\n\n\"Why, it\'s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three\ncases,\" said the butler\'s assistant.\n\n\"Oh, wait, please!\" And Natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out\nthe things. \"These aren\'t needed,\" said she, putting aside some plates\nof Kiev ware. \"These--yes, these must go among the carpets,\" she said,\nreferring to the Saxony china dishes.\n\n\"Don\'t, Natasha! Leave it alone! We\'ll get it all packed,\" urged\nSonya reproachfully.\n\n\"What a young lady she is!\" remarked the major-domo.\n\nBut Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began\nquickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and\nunnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had\nbeen taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned\nout that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all\nbeen rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases.\nOnly the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A\nfew more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on\nhaving her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler\'s\nassistant and Petya--whom she had drawn into the business of\npacking--press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.\n\n\"That\'s enough, Natasha,\" said Sonya. \"I see you were right, but\njust take out the top one.\"\n\n\"I won\'t!\" cried Natasha, with one hand holding back the hair that\nhung over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down\nthe carpets. \"Now press, Petya! Press, Vasilich, press hard!\" she\ncried.\n\nThe carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping her hands,\nscreamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only\nlasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted\nher completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that\nNatasha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came\nto her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it\nmight be corded up. Thanks to Natasha\'s directions the work now went\non expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most\nvaluable packed as compactly as possible.\n\nBut hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could\nnot get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the\ncount, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.\n\nSonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing.\n\nThat night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, and\nMavra Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought\ninto the Rostovs\' yard. Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was a very\nimportant man. He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised\nhood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the\ndriver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers\nfollowed the carriage in a cart.\n\n\"Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house\nwill be empty,\" said the old woman to the old attendant.\n\n\"Well, perhaps,\" said he with a sigh. \"We don\'t expect to get him\nhome alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it\'s a long\nway from here, and there\'s nobody living in it.\"\n\n\"Do us the honor to come in, there\'s plenty of everything in the\nmaster\'s house. Come in,\" said Mavra Kuzminichna. \"Is he very ill?\"\nshe asked.\n\nThe attendant made a hopeless gesture.\n\n\"We don\'t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.\"\n\nAnd the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.\n\n\"All right!\" said the doctor.\n\nThe old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook his\nhead disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and\nstopped beside Mavra Kuzminichna.\n\n\"O, Lord Jesus Christ!\" she murmured.\n\nShe invited them to take the wounded man into the house.\n\n\"The masters won\'t object...\" she said.\n\nBut they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took\nhim into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame\nSchoss\'.\n\nThis wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski.');

It was a clear bright autumn day, a\nSunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just\nas usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the\ncity.\n\nOnly two things indicated the social condition of Moscow--the\nrabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An\nenormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with\nwhom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone\nearly that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for\nRostopchin who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow\nwould be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the\npublic houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state\nof affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept\nrising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling,\nso that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable\ngoods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they\ncarted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each,\nand furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.\n\nIn the Rostovs\' staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of\nformer conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs\nthe only indication was that three out of their huge retinue\ndisappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the\nvalue of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come\nin from their estates and which many people envied proved to be\nextremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for\nthem. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on\nthe previous evening and early in the morning of the first of\nSeptember, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the\nRostovs\' and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostovs\'\nand from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating\nthe servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo\nto whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the\nwounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention\nthe matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was\nevident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to\nrefuse another, or all the carts and one\'s own carriages as well.\nThirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general\ncatastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one\'s own family. So\nthought the major-domo on his master\'s behalf.\n\nOn waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom softly,\nso as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward\nmorning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In\nthe yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front\nporch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly\nand to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count\nthe major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go\naway.\n\n\"Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?\" asked the count, and stroking\nhis bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the\norderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)\n\n\"We can harness at once, your excellency.\"\n\n\"Well, that\'s right. As soon as the countess wakes we\'ll be off, God\nwilling! What is it, gentlemen?\" he added, turning to the officer.\n\"Are you staying in my house?\"\n\nThe officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.\n\n\"Count, be so good as to allow me... for God\'s sake, to get into\nsome corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I\nshall be all right on a loaded cart...\"\n\nBefore the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same\nrequest on behalf of his master.\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, yes!\" said the count hastily. \"I shall be very\npleased, very pleased. Vasilich, you\'ll see to it. Just unload one\nor two carts. Well, what of it... do what\'s necessary...\" said the\ncount, muttering some indefinite order.\n\nBut at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the\nofficer\'s face had already sealed the order. The count looked around\nhim. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded\nofficers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at\nthe count and moving toward the porch.\n\n\"Please step into the gallery, your excellency,\" said the\nmajor-domo. \"What are your orders about the pictures?\"\n\nThe count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to\nrefuse the wounded who asked for a lift.\n\n\"Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,\" he added\nin a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.\n\nAt nine o\'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, who\nhad been her lady\'s maid before her marriage and now performed a\nsort of chief gendarme\'s duty for her, came to say that Madame\nSchoss was much offended and the young ladies\' summer dresses could\nnot be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame\nSchoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its\ncart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken\nout of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the\nsimplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them.\nThe countess sent for her husband.\n\n\"What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.\"\n\n\"You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer\ncame to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are\nthings that can be bought but think what being left behind means to\nthem!... Really now, in our own yard--we asked them in ourselves and\nthere are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let\nthem be taken... where\'s the hurry?\"\n\nThe count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money\nmatters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of\nnews of something detrimental to the children\'s interests, such as the\nbuilding of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a\nprivate theater or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose\nanything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do\nso.\n\nShe assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:\n\"Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting\nnothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our--all the\nchildren\'s property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand\nrubles\' worth of things in the house. I don\'t consent, my dear, I\ndon\'t! Do as you please! It\'s the government\'s business to look after\nthe wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhins opposite, they\ncleared out everything two days ago. That\'s what other people do. It\'s\nonly we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for\nthe children.\"\n\nFlourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without\nreplying.\n\n\"Papa, what are you doing that for?\" asked Natasha, who had followed\nhim into her mother\'s room.\n\n\"Nothing! What business is it of yours?\" muttered the count angrily.\n\n\"But I heard,\" said Natasha. \"Why does Mamma object?\"\n\n\"What business is it of yours?\" cried the count.\n\nNatasha stepped up to the window and pondered.\n\n\"Papa!

So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence\nfor family and domestic reasons.\n\nBerg drove up to his father-in-law\'s house in his spruce little trap\nwith a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He\nlooked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to\nthe porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.\n\nFrom the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into\nthe drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of\nNatasha and Sonya, and hastened to inquire after \"Mamma\'s\" health.\n\n\"Health, at a time like this?\" said the count. \"Come, tell us the\nnews!

It\'s abominable!\" she screamed. \"You can\'t possibly\nhave ordered it!\"\n\nBerg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The\ncount stood still at the window and listened.\n\n\"Mamma, it\'s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!\" she\ncried. \"They will be left!...\"\n\n\"What\'s the matter with you? Who are \'they\'? What do you want?\"\n\n\"Why, the wounded! It\'s impossible, Mamma. It\'s monstrous!... No,\nMamma darling, it\'s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling....\nMamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is\ngoing on in the yard... Mamma!... It\'s impossible!\"\n\nThe count stood by the window and listened without turning round.\nSuddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.\n\nThe countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for\nher mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did\nnot turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.\n\n\"Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?\" she said, not\nsurrendering at once.\n\n\"Mamma, darling, forgive me!\"\n\nBut the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her\nhusband.\n\n\"My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don\'t understand\nabout it,\" said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.\n\n\"The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,\" muttered the count\nthrough tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide\nher look of shame on his breast.\n\n\"Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...\" asked Natasha. \"We will\nstill take all the most necessary things.\"\n\nThe count nodded affirmatively, and Natasha, at the rapid pace at\nwhich she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to\nthe anteroom and downstairs into the yard.\n\nThe servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the\nstrange order she brought them until the count himself, in his\nwife\'s name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the\nwounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood\nthat order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and\nzeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it\nseemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour\nbefore it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should\nbe left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the\nonly thing to do.\n\nThe whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner,\nset eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the\ncarts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood\nwith pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to\nbe had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men\nbegan to come into the Rostovs\' yard. Many of the wounded asked them\nnot to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the\nthings. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be\narrested. It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the\nthings were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and\nmirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay\nabout the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding\npossibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have\nanother and yet another cart.\n\n\"We can take four more men,\" said the steward. \"They can have my\ntrap, or else what is to become of them?\"\n\n\"Let them have my wardrobe cart,\" said the countess. \"Dunyasha can\ngo with me in the carriage.\"\n\nThey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from\na house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was\nbright and animated. Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement\nsuch as she had not known for a long time.\n\n\"What could we fasten this onto?\" asked the servants, trying to\nfix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. \"We must keep\nat least one cart.\"\n\n\"What\'s in it?\" asked Natasha.\n\n\"The count\'s books.\"\n\n\"Leave it, Vasilich will put it away. It\'s not wanted.\"\n\nThe phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where\nCount Peter could sit.\n\n\"On the box. You\'ll sit on the box, won\'t you, Petya?\" cried\nNatasha.\n\nSonya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was\nquite different from Natasha\'s. She was putting away the things that\nhad to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess\nwished, and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.');

With the help of a maid she\nwas arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that\nstood at the entrance.\n\n\"Whose caleche is that?\" she inquired, leaning out of the carriage\nwindow.\n\n\"Why, didn\'t you know, Miss?\" replied the maid. \"The wounded prince:\nhe spent the night in our house and is going with us.\"\n\n\"But who is it? What\'s his name?\"\n\n\"It\'s our intended that was--Prince Bolkonski himself! They say he\nis dying,\" replied the maid with a sigh.\n\nSonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,\ntired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was\npacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to\nassemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before\nstarting. Natasha was not in the room.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Sonya, \"Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is\ngoing with us.\"\n\nThe countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya\'s arm,\nglanced around.\n\n\"Natasha?\" she murmured.\n\nAt that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.\nThey knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen if she\nheard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.\n\n\"Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us,\" said Sonya.\n\n\"You say he is dying?\"\n\nSonya nodded.\n\nThe countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.\n\n\"The ways of God are past finding out!\" she thought, feeling that\nthe Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all\nthat was now taking place.\n\n\"Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What\'s the matter?\" asked\nNatasha, as with animated face she ran into the room.\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the countess. \"If everything is ready let us\nstart.\"\n\nAnd the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face.\nSonya embraced Natasha and kissed her.\n\nNatasha looked at her inquiringly.\n\n\"What is it? What has happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing... No...\"\n\n\"Is it something very bad for me? What is it?\" persisted Natasha\nwith her quick intuition.\n\nSonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss,\nMavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having\nclosed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments\nsilently seated without looking at one another.\n\nThe count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed\nhimself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count\nembraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow,\nand while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted\ntheir backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting\nwords. The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on\nher knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging\non the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition\nwas connected, were being taken with them.)\n\nIn the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with\nswords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and\nwith belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining\nbehind.\n\nAs is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put\nin the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on\neach side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help\nthe countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the\nhouse to the carriages, the caleche, the phaeton, and back again.\n\n\"They always will forget everything!\" said the countess. \"Don\'t\nyou know I can\'t sit like that?\"\n\nAnd Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an\naggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange\nthe seat.\n\n\"Oh, those servants!\" said the count, swaying his head.\n\nEfim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to\ndrive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as\nglance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years\'\nexperience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, \"Be\noff, in God\'s name!\" would be given him: and he knew that even when it\nwas said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back\nto fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he\nwould again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of\nthe window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully\ndown the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what\nwould happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the\nnear one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and\nchamping his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were\nfolded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a\ntraveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to\nsay. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself.\nThe postilion and all the other servants did the same. \"Off, in\nGod\'s name!\" said Efim, putting on his hat. \"Start!\" The postilion\nstarted the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the\nhigh springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman\nsprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed\nout of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted\nin their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In\nthe carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as\nthey passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in\nMoscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.\n\nRarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting\nin the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly\nreceding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned\nout of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the\nlong train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line\nshe could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew\'s caleche. She did\nnot know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her\neyes sought that caleche. She knew it was right in front.\n\nIn Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets\ncame several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs\', and\nas they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts\nformed two rows abreast.\n\nAs they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was\ninquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking\npast, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:\n\n\"Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it\'s he!\"\n\n\"Who? Who?\"\n\n\"Look! Yes, on my word, it\'s Bezukhov!\" said Natasha, putting her\nhead out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a\ncoachman\'s long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was\nevidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the\narch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced,\nbeardless old man in a frieze coat.\n\n\"Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman\'s coat, with a\nqueer-looking old boy. Really,\" said Natasha, \"look, look!\"\n\n\"No, it\'s not he. How can you talk such nonsense?\"\n\n\"Mamma,\" screamed Natasha, \"I\'ll stake my head it\'s he! I assure\nyou! Stop, stop!\" she cried to the coachman.\n\nBut the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street\ncame more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at\nto move on and not block the way.\n\nIn fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the\nRostovs all saw Pierre--or someone extraordinarily like him--in a\ncoachman\'s coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious\nface beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That\nold man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at\nthem, and respectfully touching Pierre\'s elbow said something to him\nand pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought,\ncould not at first understand him. At length when he had understood\nand looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized\nNatasha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly\ntoward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember\nsomething and stopped.\n\nNatasha\'s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical\nkindliness.\n\n\"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is\nwonderful!\" she cried, holding out her hand to him. \"What are you\ndoing? Why are you like this?\"\n\nPierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he\nwalked along beside her while the coach still moved on.\n\n\"What is the matter, Count?\" asked the countess in a surprised and\ncommiserating tone.\n\n\"What? What? Why? Don\'t ask me,\" said Pierre, and looked round at\nNatasha whose radiant, happy expression--of which he was conscious\nwithout looking at her--filled him with enchantment.\n\n\"Are you remaining in Moscow, then?\"\n\nPierre hesitated.\n\n\"In Moscow?\" he said in a questioning tone. \"Yes, in Moscow.\nGood-by!\"\n\n\"Ah, if only I were a man? I\'d certainly stay with you. How\nsplendid!\" said Natasha. \"Mamma, if you\'ll let me, I\'ll stay!\"\n\nPierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something,\nbut the countess interrupted him.\n\n\"You were at the battle, we heard.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was,\" Pierre answered. \"There will be another battle\ntomorrow...\" he began, but Natasha interrupted him.\n\n\"But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like\nyourself....\"\n\n\"Oh, don\'t ask me, don\'t ask me! I don\'t know myself. Tomorrow...\nBut no! Good-by, good-by!\" he muttered. \"It\'s an awful time!\" and\ndropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.\n\nNatasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming\nat him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.');

This is\nhow it happened.\n\nWhen he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his\ninterview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some time make out\nwhere he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that\namong others awaiting him in his reception room there was a\nFrenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Helene,\nhe felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and\nhopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything\nwas now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces,\nthat nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was\nno escape from this position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to\nhimself, he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then\nrose, went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the\ncrack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a book. His\nmajor-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had\nbrought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if\nonly for a minute, and that someone from Bazdeev\'s widow had called to\nask Pierre to take charge of her husband\'s books, as she herself was\nleaving for the country.\n\n\"Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say\nI will come directly,\" Pierre replied to the major-domo.\n\nBut as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat\nwhich was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other\ndoor. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole\nlength of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his\nforehead with both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The\nhall porter was standing at the front door. From the landing where\nPierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back\nentrance. He went down that staircase and out into the yard. No one\nhad seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as soon as\nPierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter\nnoticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being\nlooked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in\norder not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went\ndown the street.\n\nOf all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph\nBazdeev\'s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.\n\nHe hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the\nPatriarch\'s Ponds, where the widow Bazdeev\'s house was.\n\nContinually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that\nwere making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing\nhis bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle,\nPierre, experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school,\nbegan to talk to his driver.\n\nThe man told him that arms were being distributed today at the\nKremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the\nThree Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there.\n\nHaving reached the Patriarch\'s Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs\'\nhouse, where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the\ngate. Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at\nTorzhok five years before with Joseph Bazdeev, came out in answer to\nhis knock.\n\n\"At home?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danilovna has gone to\nthe Torzhok estate with the children, your excellency.\"\n\n\"I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,\"\nsaid Pierre.\n\n\"Be so good as to step in. Makar Alexeevich, the brother of my\nlate master--may the kingdom of heaven be his--has remained here,\nbut he is in a weak state as you know,\" said the old servant.\n\nPierre knew that Makar Alexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev\'s half-insane\nbrother and a hard drinker.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in...\" said Pierre and entered the\nhouse.\n\nA tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown\nand with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing\nPierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.\n\n\"He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your\nhonor sees,\" said Gerasim. \"Will you step into the study?\" Pierre\nnodded. \"As it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia\nDanilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to\nhave the books.\"\n\nPierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such\ntrepidation in his benefactor\'s lifetime. The room, dusty and\nuntouched since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier.\n\nGerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe.\nPierre went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the\nmanuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most\nimportant, the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic\nScotch Acts with Bazdeev\'s notes and explanations. He sat down at\nthe dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts before\nhim, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and\nresting his head on his hand sank into meditation.\n\nGerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw\nPierre always sitting in the same attitude.\n\nMore than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of making\na slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did\nnot hear him.\n\n\"Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\" said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. \"Look\nhere,\" he added, taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking\ndown at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, \"I say, do\nyou know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?\"\n\n\"We heard so,\" replied the man.\n\n\"I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency,\" replied Gerasim. \"Will you have something to\neat?\"\n\n\"No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a\npistol,\" said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.\n\n\"Yes, your excellency,\" said Gerasim after thinking for a moment.\n\nAll the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor\'s\nstudy, and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to\nanother and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made\nup for him there.\n\nGerasim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange\nthings, accepted Pierre\'s taking up his residence in the house without\nsurprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same\nevening--without even asking himself what they were wanted for--he\nprocured a coachman\'s coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him\nthe pistol next day. Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening\nshuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and\nlooked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward\nhim he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and\nangry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the\ncoachman\'s coat which Gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected\nby steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the\nSukharev market that he met the Rostovs.');

At daybreak, however, those\nnearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of\nsoldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the\nopposite side and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless\nmasses of troops were bearing down on them from behind, and an\nunreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. They all rushed forward\nto the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and the boats. Kutuzov\nhimself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow.\n\nBy ten o\'clock in the morning of the second of September, only the\nrear guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb, where they had ample\nroom. The main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.\n\nAt that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,\nNapoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny Hill looking at\nthe panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to\nthe second of September, that is from the battle of Borodino to the\nentry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,\nmemorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that\nalways comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat\nthan in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear\natmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and\nrefreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights\nare warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and\ndelight us continually by falling from the sky.\n\nAt ten in the morning of the second of September this weather\nstill held.\n\nThe brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the\nPoklonny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens,\nand her churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her\ncupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight.\n\nThe view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as\nhe had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious\nand uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that\nhas no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full\nforce of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a\ndistance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the\nPoklonny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as\nit were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body.\n\nEvery Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every\nforeigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the\nmother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.\n\n\"Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises, Moscou la sainte.\nLa voila done enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il etait temps,\"* said he,\nand dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before\nhim, and summoned Lelorgne d\'Ideville, the interpreter.\n\n\n*\"That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here\nit is then at last, that famous city. It was high time.\"\n\n\n\"A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her\nhonor,\" thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at Smolensk). From\nthat point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen\nbefore. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had\nseemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning\nlight he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its\ndetails, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him.\n\n\"But could it be otherwise?\" he thought. \"Here is this capital at my\nfeet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,\nbeautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In\nwhat light must I appear to them!\" thought he, thinking of his troops.\n\"Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,\" he\nreflected, glancing at those near him and at the troops who were\napproaching and forming up. \"One word from me, one movement of my\nhand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But my\nclemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished. I must be\nmagnanimous and truly great. But no, it can\'t be true that I am in\nMoscow,\" he suddenly thought. \"Yet here she is lying at my feet,\nwith her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the\nsunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism\nand despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy....\nIt is just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know him.\"\n(It seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what was taking\nplace lay in the personal struggle between himself and Alexander.)\n\"From the height of the Kremlin--yes, there is the Kremlin, yes--I\nwill give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true\ncivilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their\nconqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do\nnot, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy\nof their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I\nwill accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not\nwish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch.\n\'Boyars,\' I will say to them, \'I do not desire war, I desire the peace\nand welfare of all my subjects.\' However, I know their presence will\ninspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly,\nimpressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in\nMoscow? Yes, there she lies.\"\n\n\"Qu\'on m\'amene les boyars,\"* said he to his suite.\n\n\n*\"Bring the boyars to me.\"\n\n\nA general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the\nboyars.\n\nTwo hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the\nsame place on the Poklonny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to\nthe boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That\nspeech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.\n\nHe was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended\nto adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for\nassemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and\nhis own would mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who\nwould win the hearts of the people. Having learned that there were\nmany charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he\nwould shower favors on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he\nhad to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must\nbe beneficent like the Tsars. And in order finally to touch the hearts\nof the Russians--and being like all Frenchmen unable to imagine\nanything sentimental without a reference to ma chere, ma tendre, ma\npauvre mere* --he decided that he would place an inscription on all\nthese establishments in large letters: \"This establishment is\ndedicated to my dear mother.\" Or no, it should be simply: Maison de ma\nMere,*[2] he concluded. \"But am I really in Moscow?

The faces of those who\nwere not conferring together were pale and perturbed. They were not\nalarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned by its\ninhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the question how to\ntell the Emperor--without putting him in the terrible position of\nappearing ridiculous--that he had been awaiting the boyars so long\nin vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no one\nelse. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped\ntogether, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor\nshould first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the\ntruth.\n\n\"He will have to be told, all the same,\" said some gentlemen of\nthe suite. \"But, gentlemen...\"\n\nThe position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating\nupon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before\nthe outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from\nunder his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.\n\n\"But it\'s impossible...\" declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging\ntheir shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word--le\nridicule...\n\nAt last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor\'s\ninstinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too\nlong drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with\nhis hand. A single report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops,\nwho were already spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into\nthe city through Tver, Kaluga, and Dorogomilov gates. Faster and\nfaster, vying with one another, they moved at the double or at a trot,\nvanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air\nring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts.\n\nDrawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as\nfar as the Dorogomilov gate, but there again stopped and,\ndismounting from his horse, paced for a long time by the\nKammer-Kollezski rampart, awaiting the deputation.');

There were still people in it, perhaps a\nfiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was\nempty. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.\n\nIn a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance\nit seems as much alive as other hives.\n\nThe bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday\nsun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of\nhoney like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But\none has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer\nany life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the\nsound that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper\'s tap\non the wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous\nhumming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly\ncompressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an\naerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from\ndifferent parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board,\ninstead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom,\nand the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and\ndecay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels\nsounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in\ndefense of the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of\nthrobbing activity, like the sound of boiling water, but diverse\ndiscordant sounds of disorder. In and out of the hive long black\nrobber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not\nsting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey\nflew into the hive, and they flew out empty; now they fly out laden.\nThe beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in. Instead\nof black, glossy bees--tamed by toil, clinging to one another\'s legs\nand drawing out the wax, with a ceaseless hum of labor--that used to\nhang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled\nbees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and\nwalls of the hive. Instead of a neatly glued floor, swept by the bees\nwith the fanning of their wings, there is a floor littered with bits\nof wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving their legs, and dead\nones that have not been cleared away.\n\nThe beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the\nsuper. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the\ncombs and keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex\nstructures of the combs, but no longer in their former state of\npurity. All is neglected and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and\nstealthily prowling about the combs, and the short home bees,\nshriveled and listless as if they were old, creep slowly about without\ntrying to hinder the robbers, having lost all motive and all sense\nof life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and butterflies knock awkwardly\nagainst the walls of the hive in their flight. Here and there among\nthe cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can\nsometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of bees, by force of habit\nand custom cleaning out the brood cells, with efforts beyond their\nstrength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing\nwhy they do it. In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting,\nor cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, without themselves\nknowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third\nplace a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack some victim and\nfight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops\nfrom above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses.\nThe keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells.\nIn place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of\nbees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation,\nhe sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They\nhave almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had\nguarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only a\nfew of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the\nenemy\'s hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are\ndead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the\nhive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears out its contents\nand burns it clean.\n\nSo in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy,\nand morose, paced up and down in front of the Kammer-Kollezski\nrampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal,\nobservance of the proprieties--a deputation.\n\nIn various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people\naimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of\nwhat they were doing.\n\nWhen with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was\nempty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently\ncontinued to walk to and fro.\n\n\"My carriage!\" he said.\n\nHe took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into\nthe suburb. \"Moscow deserted!\" he said to himself. \"What an incredible\nevent!\"\n\nHe did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the\nDorogomilov suburb.\n\nThe coup de theatre had not come off.');

Crowds of the kind seen at cheap\nsales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were\nno dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers\nto enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of\nfemale purchasers--but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though\nwithout muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently\nmaking their way out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen\nand their assistants (of whom there were but few) moved about among\nthe soldiers quite bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked\nthem up again, and themselves carried goods away with the help of their\nassistants. On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating\nthe muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting\nsoldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made\nthem, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in the\nshops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with\nclosely shaven heads. Two officers, one with a scarf over his\nuniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an\novercoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka Street,\ntalking. A third officer galloped up to them.\n\n\"The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.\nThis is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.\"\n\n\"Where are you off to?... Where?...\" he shouted to three infantrymen\nwithout muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were\nslipping past him into the Bazaar passage. \"Stop, you rascals!\"\n\n\"But how are you going to stop them?\" replied another officer.\n\"There is no getting them together. The army should push on before the\nrest bolt, that\'s all!\"\n\n\"How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge,\nand don\'t move. Shouldn\'t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest\nfrom running away?\"\n\n\"Come, go in there and drive them out!\" shouted the senior officer.\n\nThe officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went\nwith him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a\ngroup. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose,\nand a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face,\nhurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his\narms.\n\n\"Your honor!\" said he. \"Be so good as to protect us! We won\'t grudge\ntrifles, you are welcome to anything--we shall be delighted!\nPray!... I\'ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable\ngentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is;\nbut what\'s all this--sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be\nplaced if only to let us close the shop....\"\n\nSeveral shopkeepers crowded round the officer.\n\n\"Eh, what twaddle!\" said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man.\n\"When one\'s head is gone one doesn\'t weep for one\'s hair! Take what\nany of you like!\" And flourishing his arm energetically he turned\nsideways to the officer.\n\n\"It\'s all very well for you, Ivan Sidorych, to talk,\" said the first\ntradesman angrily. \"Please step inside, your honor!\"\n\n\"Talk indeed!\" cried the thin one. \"In my three shops here I have\na hundred thousand rubles\' worth of goods. Can they be saved when\nthe army has gone? Eh, what people! \'Against God\'s might our hands\ncan\'t fight.\'\"\n\n\"Come inside, your honor!\" repeated the tradesman, bowing.\n\nThe officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.\n\n\"It\'s not my business!\" he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one\nof the passages.\n\nFrom one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and\njust as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven\nhead was flung out violently.\n\nThis man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer.\nThe officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that\nmoment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the\nMoskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square.\n\n\"What is it? What is it?\" he asked, but his comrade was already\ngalloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction from which\nthe screams came.\n\nThe officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached\nthe bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the\nbridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces\namong the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two\nhorses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close\nto the wheels. The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a\nchild\'s chair with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering\npiercing and desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers\nthat the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to\nthe fact that General Ermolov, coming up to the crowd and learning\nthat soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of\ncivilians blocked the bridge, had ordered two guns to be unlimbered\nand made a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd, crushing one\nanother, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately,\nhad cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.');

There was hardly anyone\nin the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and\nthere round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be\nheard. Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely\nheard. The Povarskaya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard\nof the Rostovs\' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung\nfrom the horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great\ndrawing room of the house, which had been left with all it\ncontained, were two people. They were the yard porter Ignat, and the\npage boy Mishka, Vasilich\'s grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his\ngrandfather. Mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on\nit with one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling\nwith satisfaction before the large mirror.\n\n\"Isn\'t it fine, eh, Uncle Ignat?\" said the boy, suddenly beginning\nto strike the keyboard with both hands.\n\n\"Only fancy!\" answered Ignat, surprised at the broadening grin on\nhis face in the mirror.\n\n\"Impudence! Impudence!\" they heard behind them the voice of Mavra\nKuzminichna who had entered silently. \"How he\'s grinning, the fat mug!\nIs that what you\'re here for? Nothing\'s cleared away down there and\nVasilich is worn out.

Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate.\n\n\"Who do you want?\"\n\n\"The count--Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\"\n\n\"An officer, I have to see him,\" came the reply in a pleasant,\nwell-bred Russian voice.\n\nMavra Kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with\nthe round face of a Rostov, entered the yard.\n\n\"They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,\"\nsaid Mavra Kuzminichna cordially.\n\nThe young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating\nwhether to enter or not, clicked his tongue.\n\n\"Ah, how annoying!\" he muttered. \"I should have come yesterday....\nAh, what a pity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mavra Kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically\nexamining the familiar Rostov features of the young man\'s face, his\ntattered coat and trodden-down boots.\n\n\"What did you want to see the count for?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh well... it can\'t be helped!\" said he in a tone of vexation and\nplaced his hand on the gate as if to leave.\n\nHe again paused in indecision.\n\n\"You see,\" he suddenly said, \"I am a kinsman of the count\'s and he\nhas been very kind to me. As you see\" (he glanced with an amused air\nand good-natured smile at his coat and boots) \"my things are worn\nout and I have no money, so I was going to ask the count...\"\n\nMavra Kuzminichna did not let him finish.\n\n\"Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment,\" said she.\n\nAnd as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,\nhurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the\nservants\' quarters.\n\nWhile Mavra Kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked\nabout the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a\nfaint smile on his lips. \"What a pity I\'ve missed Uncle! What a nice\nold woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the\nnearest way to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near\nthe Rogozhski gate?\" thought he.

On benches\nround the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands.\nTipsy and perspiring, with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were\nall laboriously singing some song or other. They were singing\ndiscordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not\nbecause they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were\ndrunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue\ncoat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight\nnose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin,\ncompressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently\npossessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and\nsolemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with\nthe sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out\nhis dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he\nalways carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it\nwere most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing\nshould be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and\nfighting and blows in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his\narm.\n\n\"Stop it!\" he exclaimed peremptorily. \"There\'s a fight, lads!\"\nAnd, still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.\n\nThe factory hands followed him. These men, who under the\nleadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning,\nhad brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this\nhad had drink served them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring\nsmithy, hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it\nto have been broken into, wished to force their way in too and a fight\nin the porch had resulted.\n\nThe publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when\nthe workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern\nkeeper, fell face downward on the pavement.\n\nAnother smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the\npublican with his chest.\n\nThe lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the\nface and cried wildly: \"They\'re fighting us, lads!\"\n\nAt that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised\nface to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: \"Police! Murder!...\nThey\'ve killed a man, lads!\"\n\n\"Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death--killed!...\" screamed a\nwoman coming out of a gate close by.\n\nA crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.\n\n\"Haven\'t you robbed people enough--taking their last shirts?\" said a\nvoice addressing the publican. \"What have you killed a man for, you\nthief?\"\n\nThe tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from\nthe publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he\nought to fight now.\n\n\"Murderer!\" he shouted suddenly to the publican. \"Bind him, lads!\"\n\n\"I daresay you would like to bind me!\" shouted the publican, pushing\naway the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head\nhe flung it on the ground.\n\nAs if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the\nworkmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.\n\n\"I know the law very well, mates! I\'ll take the matter to the\ncaptain of police. You think I won\'t get to him? Robbery is not\npermitted to anybody now a days!\" shouted the publican, picking up his\ncap.\n\n\"Come along then! Come along then!\" the publican and the tall\nyoung fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the\nstreet together.\n\nThe bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and\nothers followed behind, talking and shouting.\n\nAt the corner of the Moroseyka, opposite a large house with closed\nshutters and bearing a bootmaker\'s signboard, stood a score of thin,\nworn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long\ntattered coats.\n\n\"He should pay folks off properly,\" a thin workingman, with frowning\nbrows and a straggly beard, was saying.\n\n\"But he\'s sucked our blood and now he thinks he\'s quit of us. He\'s\nbeen misleading us all the week and now that he\'s brought us to this\npass he\'s made off.\"\n\nOn seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased\nspeaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the\nmoving crowd.\n\n\"Where are all the folks going?\"\n\n\"Why, to the police, of course!\"\n\n\"I say, is it true that we have been beaten?\" \"And what did you\nthink? Look what folks are saying.\"\n\nQuestions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage\nof the increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.\n\nThe tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his\nbare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention\nto himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded,\nexpecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their\nminds.\n\n\"He must keep order, keep the law, that\'s what the government is\nthere for. Am I not right, good Christians?\" said the tall youth, with\na scarcely perceptible smile. \"He thinks there\'s no government! How\ncan one do without government?

You\'d better listen to what\npeople are saying,\" said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.\n\nBy the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered\nround a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.\n\n\"An ukase, they are reading an ukase!

I will come back to dinner, and we\'ll set to work. We will\ndo, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.\"\n\nThe last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The\ntall lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had\nunderstood the last part. In particular, the words \"I will come back\nto dinner,\" evidently displeased both reader and audience. The\npeople\'s minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple\nand needlessly comprehensible--it was what any one of them might\nhave said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest\nauthority should not say.\n\nThey all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his\nlips and swayed from side to side.\n\n\"We should ask him... that\'s he himself?\"... \"Yes, ask him\nindeed!... Why not? He\'ll explain\"... voices in the rear of the\ncrowd were suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned\nto the police superintendent\'s trap which drove into the square\nattended by two mounted dragoons.\n\nThe superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count\nRostopchin\'s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that\nmatter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his\npocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to\nstop.\n\n\"What people are these?\" he shouted to the men, who were moving\nsingly and timidly in the direction of his trap.\n\n\"What people are these?\" he shouted again, receiving no answer.\n\n\"Your honor...\" replied the shopman in the frieze coat, \"your honor,\nin accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count,\nthey desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any\nkind of riot, but as his highest excellence said...\"\n\n\"The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued\nconcerning you,\" said the superintendent of police. \"Go on!\" he\nordered his coachman.\n\nThe crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the\nsuperintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.\n\nThe superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a\nscared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses\nincreased their speed.\n\n\"It\'s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!\" shouted the tall\nyouth. \"Don\'t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!\"\nshouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.\n\nFollowing the superintendent of police and talking loudly the\ncrowd went in the direction of the Lubyanka Street.\n\n\"There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to\nperish.

Distressed, offended, and\nsurprised by all this, Rostopchin had returned to Moscow. After supper\nhe lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon\nafter midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutuzov. This\nletter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops\nthrough the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond\nMoscow. This was not news to Rostopchin. He had known that Moscow\nwould be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day\nwith Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but ever since the battle of\nBorodino, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle\nhad said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle,\nand since then the government property had been removed every night,\nand half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchin\'s own\npermission. Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated\nthe count, coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order\nfrom Kutuzov, and received at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.\n\nWhen later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his\nactions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated\nby two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow\nand expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this\ntwofold aim all Rostopchin\'s actions appear irreproachable. \"Why\nwere the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of\ncorn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into\nbelieving that Moscow would not be given up--and thereby ruined?\"\n\"To preserve the tranquillity of the city,\" explains Count Rostopchin.\n\"Why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices, and\nLeppich\'s balloon and other articles removed?\" \"To leave the town\nempty,\" explains Count Rostopchin. One need only admit that public\ntranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification.\n\nAll the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude\nfor public tranquillity.\n\nOn what, then, was Count Rostopchin\'s fear for the tranquillity of\nMoscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any\nprobability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving\nit and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause\nthe masses to riot?\n\nNeither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling\nan insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than\nten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of\nSeptember, and except for a mob in the governor\'s courtyard, assembled\nthere at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would\nhave been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if\nafter the battle of Borodino, when the surrender of Moscow became\ncertain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting the\npeople by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to\nremove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and\nhad told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned.\n\nRostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and\nimpulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative\ncircles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed\nhimself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy\'s entry into Smolensk he\nhad in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular\nfeeling of \"the heart of Russia.\" Not only did it seem to him (as to\nall administrators) that he controlled the external actions of\nMoscow\'s inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental\nattitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a\ncoarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not\nunderstand from those in authority. Rostopchin was so pleased with the\nfine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it,\nthat the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow\nwithout any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt\nthe ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did\nnot know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the\nlast moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and\ndid not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If\nthe government offices were removed, this was only done on the\ndemand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was\nabsorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the\ncase with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had\nlong known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his\nintellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt\nhimself mentally to this new position of affairs.\n\nAll his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful\nand had any effect on the people is another question) had been\nsimply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of\npatriotic hatred of the French.\n\nBut when events assumed their true historical character, when\nexpressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it\nwas not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle,\nwhen self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question\nbefore Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one\nman, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action\nall the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by\nRostopchin suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself\nridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.\n\nWhen, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory\nnote from Kutuzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself\nto blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state\nproperty which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it\nwas no longer possible to take the whole of it away.\n\n\"Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?\" he\nruminated. \"Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow\nfirmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!\nTraitors!\" he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and\ntraitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever\nthey might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous\nposition in which he found himself.\n\nAll that night Count Rostopchin issued orders, for which people came\nto him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the\ncount so morose and irritable.\n\n\"Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar\'s Department has\nsent for instructions... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from\nthe University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...\nasking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire\nBrigade? From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of\nthe lunatic asylum...\" All night long such announcements were\ncontinually being received by the count.\n\nTo all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating\nthat orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair,\ncarefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that\nthat somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that\nmight happen.\n\n\"Oh, tell that blockhead,\" he said in reply to the question from the\nRegistrar\'s Department, \"that he should remain to guard his documents.\nNow why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They\nhave horses, let them be off to Vladimir, and not leave them to the\nFrench.\"\n\n\"Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:\nwhat are your commands?\"\n\n\"My commands? Let them go away, that\'s all.... And let the\nlunatics out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God\nevidently means these other madmen to be free.\"\n\nIn reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count\nRostopchin shouted angrily at the governor:\n\n\"Do you expect me to give you two battalions--which we have not\ngot--for a convoy? Release them, that\'s all about it!\"\n\n\"Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkov,\nVereshchagin...\"\n\n\"Vereshchagin! Hasn\'t he been hanged yet?\" shouted Rostopchin.\n\"Bring him to me!\"');

Those who were able to get away were going of their\nown accord, those who remained behind decided for themselves what they\nmust do.\n\nThe count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki, and\nsat in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.\n\nIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that\nit is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule\nis kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable\nevery administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts.\nWhile the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his\nfrail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people\nand himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the\nship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea\nbegins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer\npossible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion,\nthe boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the\nadministrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power,\nbecomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.\n\nRostopchin felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.\n\nThe superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to\nsee him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that\nthe horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent\nof police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he\nhad received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected\nin the courtyard and wished to see him.\n\nWithout saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his\nlight, luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold\nof the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he\nhad a better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in\nfront, flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The\nblood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of\nvoices was audible through the closed window.\n\n\"Is my carriage ready?\" asked Rostopchin, stepping back from the\nwindow.\n\n\"It is, your excellency,\" replied the adjutant.\n\nRostopchin went again to the balcony door.\n\n\"But what do they want?\" he asked the superintendent of police.\n\n\"Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your\norders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about\ntreachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency--I hardly\nmanaged to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...\"\n\n\"You may go. I don\'t need you to tell me what to do!\" exclaimed\nRostopchin angrily.\n\nHe stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.\n\n\"This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have\ndone with me!\" thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled\nup within him against the someone to whom what was happening might\nbe attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was\nmastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it.\n\"Here is that mob, the dregs of the people,\" he thought as he gazed at\nthe crowd: \"this rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a\nvictim,\" he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his\narm. And this thought occurred to him just because he himself\ndesired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.\n\n\"Is the carriage ready?\" he asked again.\n\n\"Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchagin? He\nis waiting at the porch,\" said the adjutant.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Rostopchin, as if struck by an unexpected\nrecollection.\n\nAnd rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the\nbalcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed,\nand all eyes were raised to the count.\n\n\"Good morning, lads!\" said the count briskly and loudly. \"Thank\nyou for coming. I\'ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first\nsettle with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the\nruin of Moscow. Wait for me!\"\n\nAnd the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed\nthe door behind him.\n\nA murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd.\n\"He\'ll settle with all the villains, you\'ll see! And you said the\nFrench... He\'ll show you what law is!\" the mob were saying as if\nreproving one another for their lack of confidence.\n\nA few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,\ngave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved\neagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchin, coming out\nthere with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking\nsomeone.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man\ncoming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a\nlong thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again\ncovered by short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue\ncloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty\nhempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty,\ntrodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which\nhampered his irresolute movements.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the\nyoung man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the\nporch. \"Put him there.\"\n\nThe young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the\nspot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which\nchafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed,\nand submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.\n\nFor several seconds while the young man was taking his place on\nthe step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the\npeople, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs,\ngroans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.\n\nWhile waiting for the young man to take his place on the step\nRostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.\n\n\"Lads!\" said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. \"This man,\nVereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.\"\n\nThe young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a\nsubmissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated\nyoung face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down\nhopelessly. At the count\'s first words he raised it slowly and\nlooked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet\nhis eye. But Rostopchin did not look at him. A vein in the young man\'s\nlong thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and\nsuddenly his face flushed.\n\nAll eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered\nmore hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled\nsadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.\n\n\"He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to\nBonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian\nname, he has caused Moscow to perish,\" said Rostopchin in a sharp,\neven voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who continued\nto stand in the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight,\nhe raised his arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:\n\n\"Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.\"\n\nThe crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to\none another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling\natmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,\nuncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those\nstanding in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place\nbefore them, all stood with wide open eyes and mouths, straining\nwith all their strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing\nbehind them.\n\n\"Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian\nname!\" shouted Rostopchin. \"Cut him down. I command it.\"\n\nHearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin\'s\nvoice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.\n\n\"Count!\" exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchagin in\nthe midst of the momentary silence that ensued, \"Count! One God is\nabove us both....\" He lifted his head and again the thick vein in\nhis thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in\nhis face.\n\nHe did not finish what he wished to say.\n\n\"Cut him down! I command it...\" shouted Rostopchin, suddenly growing\npale like Vereshchagin.\n\n\"Draw sabers!\" cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.\n\nAnother still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching\nthe front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The\ntall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm,\nstood beside Vereshchagin.\n\n\"Saber him!\" the dragoon officer almost whispered.\n\nAnd one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,\nstruck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking round with a\nfrightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him.\nA similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. \"O Lord!\"\nexclaimed a sorrowful voice.\n\nBut after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from\nVereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was\nfatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that\nhad held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and\nmust now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by\nthe threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last\nwave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from\nthe rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and\nengulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow.\nVereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands,\nrushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled,\nseized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him\nunder the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.\n\nSome beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth. And\nthe screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who\ntried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd.\nIt was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding\nyouth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, despite the\nfeverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had\nbeen begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and tearing at\nVereshchagin were unable to kill him, for the crowd pressed from all\nsides, swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it\nimpossible for them either to kill him or let him go.\n\n\"Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold\nChrist.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture\nserves a thief right. Use the hatchet!... What--still alive?\"\n\nOnly when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a\nlong-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his\nprostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one\ncame up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and\nastonishment pushed back again.\n\n\"O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?\"\nvoices in the crowd could be heard saying. \"Quite a young fellow\ntoo... must have been a merchant\'s son. What men!... and they say he\'s\nnot the right one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there\'s\nanother has been beaten too--they say he\'s nearly done for.... Oh, the\npeople... Aren\'t they afraid of sinning?...\" said the same mob now,\nlooking with pained distress at the dead body with its long, thin,\nhalf-severed neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust.\n\nA painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse\nin his excellency\'s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it\naway. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it\nalong the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its\nlong neck trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back\nfrom it.\n\nAt the moment when Vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with\nsavage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchin suddenly turned pale\nand, instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage\nawaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing\nwhere and why, along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground\nfloor. The count\'s face was white and he could not control the\nfeverish twitching of his lower jaw.\n\n\"This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,\nplease...\" said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.\n\nCount Rostopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went\nin the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his caleche.\nThe distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He\nhastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his\ncountry house in Sokolniki.\n\nWhen they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer hear the\nshouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with\ndissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his\nsubordinates. \"The mob is terrible--disgusting,\" he said to himself in\nFrench. \"They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.\"\n\"Count! One God is above us both!\"--Vereshchagin\'s words suddenly\nrecurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this\nwas only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled\ndisdainfully at himself. \"I had other duties,\" thought he. \"The people\nhad to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing\nfor the public good\"--and he began thinking of his social duties to\nhis family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself--not\nhimself as Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore\nVasilyevich Rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good)\nbut himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the\nTsar. \"Had I been simply Theodore Vasilyevich my course of action\nwould have been quite different, but it was my duty to safeguard my\nlife and dignity as commander in chief.\"\n\nLightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no\nlonger hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin grew\nphysically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became\nphysically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally\ntranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopchin was not a new\none. Since the world began and men have killed one another no one\nhas ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without\ncomforting himself with this same idea. This idea is le bien public,\nthe hypothetical welfare of other people.\n\nTo a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he\nwho commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies.\nAnd Rostopchin now knew it.\n\nNot only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but\nhe even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully\ncontrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a\ncriminal and at the same time pacify the mob.\n\n\"Vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death,\" thought\nRostopchin (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchagin to\nhard labor), \"he was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go\nunpunished and so I have killed two birds with one stone: to appease\nthe mob I gave them a victim and at the same time punished a\nmiscreant.\"\n\nHaving reached his country house and begun to give orders about\ndomestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.\n\nHalf an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the\nSokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but\nconsidering what was to come. He was driving to the Yauza bridge where\nhe had heard that Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchin was mentally preparing\nthe angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutuzov for\nhis deception. He would make that foxy old courtier feel that the\nresponsibility for all the calamities that would follow the\nabandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded\nit) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he\nwould say to Kutuzov, Rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and\ngazed sternly from side to side.\n\nThe Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of\nthe almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in\nwhite and others like them walking singly across the field shouting\nand gesticulating.\n\nOne of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin\'s\ncarriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons looked\nwith vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and\nespecially at the one running toward them.\n\nSwaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering\ndressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on\nRostopchin, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to\nhim to stop. The lunatic\'s solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow,\nwith its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with\nsaffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.\n\n\"Stop! Pull up, I tell you!\" he cried in a piercing voice, and again\nshouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.\n\nComing abreast of the caleche he ran beside it.\n\n\"Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead.\nThey stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall\nrise. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown...\nThrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!\" he cried,\nraising his voice higher and higher.\n\nCount Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd\nclosed in on Vereshchagin. He turned away. \"Go fas... faster!\" he\ncried in a trembling voice to his coachman. The caleche flew over\nthe ground as fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time\nCount Rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing\nfainter in the distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the\nastonished, frightened, bloodstained face of \"the traitor\" in the\nfur-lined coat.\n\nRecent as that mental picture was, Rostopchin already felt that it\nhad cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt\nclearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with\ntime, but that the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in\nhis heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He\nseemed still to hear the sound of his own words: \"Cut him down! I\ncommand it....\"\n\n\"Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said\nthem.... I need not have said them,\" he thought. \"And then nothing\nwould have happened.\" He saw the frightened and then infuriated face\nof the dragoon who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid\nreproach that boy in the fur-lined coat had turned upon him. \"But I\ndid not do it for my own sake. I was bound to act that way.... The\nmob, the traitor... the public welfare,\" thought he.\n\nTroops were still crowding at the Yauza bridge. It was hot. Kutuzov,\ndejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his\nwhip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily. A man in a\ngeneral\'s uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said\nsomething in French. It was Count Rostopchin. He told Kutuzov that\nhe had come because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army\nremained.\n\n\"Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not\ntold me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle;\nall this would not have happened,\" he said.\n\nKutuzov looked at Rostopchin as if, not grasping what was said to\nhim, he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment\non the face of the man addressing him. Rostopchin grew confused and\nbecame silent. Kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his\npenetrating gaze from Rostopchin\'s face muttered softly:\n\n\"No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!\"\n\nWhether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he\nspoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be\nmeaningless, at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and hastily left\nhim. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count\nRostopchin, took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he\nbegan with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way.');

In front rode a detachment of Wurttemberg hussars and behind\nthem rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.\n\nAbout the middle of the Arbat Street, near the Church of the\nMiraculous Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the\nadvanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the\ncitadel, le Kremlin.\n\nAround Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow.\nThey all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired\ncommander dressed up in feathers and gold.\n\n\"Is that their Tsar himself? He\'s not bad!\" low voices could be\nheard saying.\n\nAn interpreter rode up to the group.\n\n\"Take off your cap... your caps!\" These words went from one to\nanother in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and\nasked if it was far to the Kremlin. The porter, listening in\nperplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that\nthe interpreter was speaking Russian, did not understand what was\nbeing said to him and slipped behind the others.\n\nMurat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the\nRussian army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and\nseveral voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French\nofficer, returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat\nand reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and\nthat there was probably an ambuscade there.\n\n\"Good!\" said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his\nsuite, ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the\ngates.\n\nThe guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and\nadvanced up the Arbat. When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka\nStreet they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers\nsuperintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin\nthrough field glasses.\n\nThe bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound\ntroubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few\ninfantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had\nbeen put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as\nsoon as an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was\nstanding by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and\nthe latter ran back again with his men.\n\nThe sound of three more shots came from the gate.\n\nOne shot struck a French soldier\'s foot, and from behind the screens\ncame the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a\nword of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of\nthe French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined\nconcentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from\nthe marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvizhenka,\nMokhavaya, or Kutafyev Street, nor the Troitsa Gate (places familiar\nin Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove\nsanguinary. And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the\ngates ceased. The guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash\noff their linstocks, and an officer gave the word \"Fire!\" This was\nfollowed by two whistling sounds of canister shot, one after\nanother. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the\nwooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over\nthe Square.\n\nA few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the\nstone-built Kremlin had died away the French heard a strange sound\nabove their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and\ncircled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings.\nTogether with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway\nand amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a\npeasant\'s coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French.\n\"Fire!\" repeated the officer once more, and the reports of a musket\nand of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The gate was again\nhidden by smoke.\n\nNothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry\nsoldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three\nwounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot\nof the wall, toward the Znamenka.\n\n\"Clear that away!\" said the officer, pointing to the beams and the\ncorpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw\nthe corpses over the parapet.\n\nWho these men were nobody knew. \"Clear that away!\" was all that\nwas said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed\nlater on that they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few\neloquent lines to their memory: \"These wretches had occupied the\nsacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal,\nand fired\" (the wretches) \"at the French. Some of them were sabered\nand the Kremlin was purged of their presence.\"\n\nMurat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered\nthe gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of\nthe windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the\nSquare for fuel and kindled fires there.\n\nOther detachments passed through the Kremlin and encamped along\nthe Moroseyka, the Lubyanka, and Pokrovka Streets. Others quartered\nthemselves along the Vozdvizhenka, the Nikolski, and the Tverskoy\nStreets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French\nwere not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in\nit as in a camp.\n\nThough tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their\noriginal number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order.\nIt was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army.\nBut it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into\ntheir different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various\nregiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the\narmy was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript,\nneither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When\nfive weeks later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed\nan army. They were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of\narticles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man\nwhen he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but\nmerely to keep what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its\npaw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts\nwill not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore\nperishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish\nbecause they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they\nhad stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to\nopen its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment\nhad entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left.\nMen in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the\nwindows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and\nstorerooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the\nyards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors,\nlighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with\nrolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or\ncaressing women and children. There were many such men both in the\nshops and houses--but there was no army.\n\nOrder after order was issued by the French commanders that day\nforbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding\nany violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a\nroll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures the\nmen, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the\nwealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As\na hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren\nfield, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as\nsoon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over\nthe wealthy city.\n\nNo residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers--like water\npercolating through sand--spread irresistibly through the city in\nall directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched. The\ncavalry, on entering a merchant\'s house that had been abandoned and\nfinding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,\nall the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of\nthem appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and\nquarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they\nhad had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the\nstreets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been\nabandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the\ntaking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were\ninvoluntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had\nbeen left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select\ncaleches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had\nremained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby\nto secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth\nand there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the\nFrench were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where,\nthey thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed\nthe army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground\nboth the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in\nthe same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted\ncity resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the\narmy and the wealthy city.\n\n\nThe French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce de\nRostopchine,* the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,\nhowever, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning\nof Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people,\nresponsible for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a\nposition in which any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite\napart from whether it had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior\nfire engines. Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of\nshavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several\ndays. A town built of wood, where scarcely a day passes without\nconflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police\nforce is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left\nit and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of\nthe Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals\ntwice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the\nvillages of any district and the number of fires in that district\nimmediately increases. How much then must the probability of fire be\nincreased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are\nquartered. \"Le patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine\" and the barbarity of\nthe French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire\nby the soldiers\' pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the\ncarelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even\nif there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any\nreason to burn the houses--in any case a troublesome and dangerous\nthing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same\nthing would have happened without any incendiarism.\n\n\n*To Rostopchin\'s ferocious patriotism.\n\n\nHowever tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchin\'s\nferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later\non to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is\nimpossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of\nthe fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house\nmust burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are\nallowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its\ninhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not\nby those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not\nremain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its\ninhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and\nsalt, nor bring them the keys of the city.');

He was completely\nobsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this\nthought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of\nthe past, understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and\nheard appeared to him like a dream.\n\nHe had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life\'s\ndemands that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was\nunable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexeevich\'s house, on the\nplea of sorting the deceased\'s books and papers, only in search of\nrest from life\'s turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph\nAlexeevich was connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm\nthoughts, quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he\nfelt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph\nAlexeevich\'s study he really found it. When he sat with his elbows\non the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study,\ncalm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after\nanother in his imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodino and\nof that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared\nwith the truth, simplicity, and strength of the class of men he\nmentally classed as they. When Gerasim roused him from his reverie the\nidea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow\nwhich he knew was projected. And with that object he had asked Gerasim\nto get him a peasant\'s coat and a pistol, confiding to him his\nintentions of remaining in Joseph Alexeevich\'s house and keeping his\nname secret. Then during the first day spent in inaction and\nsolitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic\nmanuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously\noccurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in\nconnection with Bonaparte\'s more than once vaguely presented itself.\nBut the idea that he, L\'russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit\nto the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that\noften passed through his mind and left no trace behind.\n\nWhen, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part\namong the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the\nRostovs and Natasha had said to him: \"Are you remaining in\nMoscow?... How splendid!\" the thought flashed into his mind that it\nreally would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to\nremain there and do what he was predestined to do.\n\nNext day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in\nany way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he\nreturned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he\nsuddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility\nhad now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in\nMoscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and\neither perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe--which it\nseemed to him was solely due to Napoleon.\n\nPierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte\'s life in\n1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been\nshot. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out\nhis design excited him still more.\n\nTwo equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this\npurpose. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and\nsuffering in view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had\ncaused him to go to Mozhaysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way\nto the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away\nfrom his home and, in place of the luxury and comfort to which he\nwas accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the\nsame food as Gerasim. The other was that vague and quite Russian\nfeeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial, and\nhuman--for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest\ngood in the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange and\nfascinating feeling at the Sloboda Palace, when he had suddenly felt\nthat wealth, power, and life--all that men so painstakingly acquire\nand guard--if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with\nwhich it can all be renounced.\n\nIt was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his\nlast penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for\nno apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money\nhe possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions\nwhich from an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it\nwere, his personal power and strength, affirming the existence of a\nhigher, nonhuman criterion of life.\n\nFrom the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the\nfirst time at the Sloboda Palace he had been continuously under its\ninfluence, but only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at\nthis moment Pierre was supported in his design and prevented from\nrenouncing it by what he had already done in that direction. If he\nwere now to leave Moscow like everyone else, his flight from home, the\npeasant coat, the pistol, and his announcement to the Rostovs that\nhe would remain in Moscow would all become not merely meaningless\nbut contemptible and ridiculous, and to this Pierre was very\nsensitive.\n\nPierre\'s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded\nto his mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he\ndrank during those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty\nunchanged linen, two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa\nwithout bedding--all this kept him in a state of excitement\nbordering on insanity.\n\nIt was two o\'clock in the afternoon. The French had already\nentered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only\nthought about his undertaking, going over its minutest details in\nhis mind. In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either\nthe striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon, but with\nextraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own\ndestruction and heroic endurance.\n\n\"Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!\" he\nthought. \"Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol\nor dagger? But that is all the same! \'It is not I but the hand of\nProvidence that punishes thee,\' I shall say,\" thought he, imagining\nwhat he would say when killing Napoleon. \"Well then, take me and\nexecute me!\" he went on, speaking to himself and bowing his head\nwith a sad but firm expression.\n\nWhile Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to\nhimself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold\nappeared the figure of Makar Alexeevich, always so timid before but\nnow quite transformed.\n\nHis dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was\nobviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but\nnoticing embarrassment on Pierre\'s face immediately grew bold and,\nstaggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.\n\n\"They\'re frightened,\" he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. \"I\nsay I won\'t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?\"\n\nHe paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it\nwith unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.\n\nGerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexeevich, stopped\nhim in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre,\ncoming out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the\nhalf-crazy old man. Makar Alexeevich, frowning with exertion, held\non to the pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic\nfancy in his head.\n\n\"To arms! Board them! No, you shan\'t get it,\" he yelled.\n\n\"That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness--please, sir,\nto let go! Please, sir...\" pleaded Gerasim, trying carefully to\nsteer Makar Alexeevich by the elbows back to the door.\n\n\"Who are you? Bonaparte!...\" shouted Makar Alexeevich.\n\n\"That\'s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow\nme to have the pistol.\"\n\n\"Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?\" shouted Makar\nAlexeevich, brandishing the pistol. \"Board them!\"\n\n\"Catch hold!\" whispered Gerasim to the porter.\n\nThey seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the\ndoor.\n\nThe vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle\nand of a tipsy, hoarse voice.\n\nSuddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated\nfrom the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.\n\n\"It\'s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!\" she\ncried.\n\nGerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go, and in the now\nsilent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front\ndoor could be heard.');

But the French entered and still Pierre\ndid not retire--an irresistible curiosity kept him there.\n\nThere were two of them. One was an officer--a tall, soldierly,\nhandsome man--the other evidently a private or an orderly,\nsunburned, short, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull\nexpression. The officer walked in front, leaning on a stick and\nslightly limping. When he had advanced a few steps he stopped,\nhaving apparently decided that these were good quarters, turned\nround to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in a loud voice of\ncommand ordered them to put up the horses. Having done that, the\nofficer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his\nmustache and lightly touched his hat.\n\n\"Bonjour, la compagnie!\"* said he gaily, smiling and looking about\nhim.\n\n\n*\"Good day, everybody!\"\n\n\nNo one gave any reply.\n\n\"Vous etes le bourgeois?\"* the officer asked Gerasim.\n\n\n*\"Are you the master here?\"\n\n\nGerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.\n\n\"Quartier, quartier, logement!\" said the officer, looking down at\nthe little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. \"Les\nfrancais sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fachons\npas, mon vieux!\"* added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerasim\non the shoulder. \"Well, does no one speak French in this\nestablishment?\" he asked again in French, looking around and meeting\nPierre\'s eyes. Pierre moved away from the door.\n\n\n*\"Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good fellows. What\nthe devil! There, don\'t let us be cross, old fellow!\"\n\n\nAgain the officer turned to Gerasim and asked him to show him the\nrooms in the house.\n\n\"Master, not here--don\'t understand... me, you...\" said Gerasim,\ntrying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.\n\nStill smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before\nGerasim\'s nose, intimating that he did not understand him either,\nand moved, limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre\nwished to go away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makar\nAlexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his\nhand. With a madman\'s cunning, Makar Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman,\nraised his pistol, and took aim.\n\n\"Board them!\" yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger.\nHearing the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment\nPierre threw himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and\nstruck up the pistol Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the\ntrigger, there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a\ncloud of smoke. The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.\n\nForgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French,\nPierre, snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to\nthe officer and addressed him in French.\n\n\"You are not wounded?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think not,\" answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. \"But\nI have had a lucky escape this time,\" he added, pointing to the\ndamaged plaster of the wall. \"Who is that man?\" said he, looking\nsternly at Pierre.\n\n\"Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,\" said Pierre\nrapidly, quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. \"He is\nan unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing.\"\n\nThe officer went up to Makar Alexeevich and took him by the collar.\n\nMakar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about\nto fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.\n\n\"Brigand! You shall pay for this,\" said the Frenchman, letting go of\nhim. \"We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon\ntraitors,\" he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine\nenergetic gesture.\n\nPierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold\nthat drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence\nwith the same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with\na smile. For a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome\nface assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out\nhis hand.\n\n\"You have saved my life. You are French,\" said he.\n\nFor a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman\ncould perform a great deed, and to save his life--the life of M.\nRamballe, captain of the 13th Light Regiment--was undoubtedly a very\ngreat deed.\n\nBut however indubitable that conclusion and the officer\'s conviction\nbased upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.\n\n\"I am Russian,\" he said quickly.\n\n\"Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,\" said the officer, waving his\nfinger before his nose and smiling. \"You shall tell me all about\nthat presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what\nare we to do with this man?\" he added, addressing himself to Pierre as\nto a brother.\n\nEven if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that\nloftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the\nofficer\'s look and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again\nexplained who Makar Alexeevich was and how just before their arrival\nthat drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had\nnot had time to recover from him, and begged the officer to let the\ndeed go unpunished.\n\nThe Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with\nhis arm.\n\n\"You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant\nit you. Lead that man away!\" said he quickly and energetically, and\ntaking the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for\nsaving his life, he went with him into the room.\n\nThe soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage\nasking what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish\nthe culprits, but the officer sternly checked them.\n\n\"You will be called in when you are wanted,\" he said.\n\nThe soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile\nhad time to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.\n\n\"Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,\" said\nhe. \"Shall I serve them up?\"\n\n\"Yes, and some wine,\" answered the captain.');

He was so\nvery polite, amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre\nfor saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat\ndown with him in the parlor--the first room they entered. To\nPierre\'s assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the captain,\nevidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering\nan appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre\nabsolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all\nthat he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his\nlife.\n\nHad this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving\nthe feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre\'s\nfeelings were, the latter would probably have left him, but the\nman\'s animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed\nPierre.\n\n\"A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,\" said the officer,\nlooking at Pierre\'s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his\nfinger. \"I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman\nnever forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my\nfriendship. That is all I can say.\"\n\nThere was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of\nthe word) in the officer\'s voice, in the expression of his face and in\nhis gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the\nFrenchman\'s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.\n\n\"Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the\nLegion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,\" he\nintroduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his\nlips under his mustache. \"Will you now be so good as to tell me with\nwhom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in\nthe ambulance with that maniac\'s bullet in my body?\"\n\nPierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,\nbegan to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason\nfor concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.\n\n\"Oh, please!\" said he. \"I understand your reasons. You are an\nofficer... a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us.\nThat\'s not my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am\nquite at your service. You belong to the gentry?\" he concluded with\na shade of inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. \"Your\nbaptismal name, if you please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you\nsay.... That\'s all I want to know.\"\n\nWhen the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and\nvodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a\nRussian cellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share\nhis dinner, and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a\nhealthy and hungry man, munching his food rapidly with his strong\nteeth, continually smacking his lips, and repeating--\"Excellent!\nDelicious!\" His face grew red and was covered with perspiration.\nPierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure. Morel, the\norderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of\nclaret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass, taken from the\nkitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to the French\nand had been given a special name. They called it limonade de cochon\n(pig\'s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he\nhad found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had\ntaken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and\napplied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to\nits neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for\nPierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the\ncaptain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through\ndinner.\n\n\"Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for\nsaving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my\nbody already. Here is one I got at Wagram\" (he touched his side)\n\"and a second at Smolensk\"--he showed a scar on his cheek--\"and this\nleg which as you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh\nat the great battle of la Moskowa. Sacre Dieu! It was splendid! That\ndeluge of fire was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us\nthere, my word! You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of\nthe cough I caught there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity\nthose who did not see it.\"\n\n\"I was there,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes.\nThe great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!\" continued the Frenchman.\n\"And you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times--sure as I\nsit here. Three times we reached the guns and three times we were\nthrown back like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur\nPierre! Your grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close\nup their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine\nfellows! Our King of Naples, who knows what\'s what, cried \'Bravo!\' Ha,\nha! So you are one of us soldiers!\" he added, smiling, after a\nmomentary pause. \"So much the better, so much the better, Monsieur\nPierre! Terrible in battle... gallant... with the fair\" (he winked and\nsmiled), \"that\'s what the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren\'t they?\"\n\nThe captain was so naively and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so\npleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked\nmerrily at him. Probably the word \"gallant\" turned the captain\'s\nthoughts to the state of Moscow.\n\n\"Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left\nMoscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?\"\n\n\"Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered\nit?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle,\npatting Pierre on the shoulder. \"What a thing to say!\" he exclaimed.\n\"Paris?... But Paris, Paris...\"\n\n\"Paris--the capital of the world,\" Pierre finished his remark for\nhim.\n\nThe captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in\nthe middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly\neyes.\n\n\"Well, if you hadn\'t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered\nthat you were Parisian! You have that... I don\'t know what, that...\"\nand having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.\n\n\"I have been in Paris. I spent years there,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn\'t know\nParis is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is\nTalma, la Duchenois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,\" and\nnoticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before,\nhe added quickly: \"There is only one Paris in the world. You have been\nto Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I don\'t esteem you the\nless for it.\"\n\nUnder the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days\nhe had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre\ninvoluntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.\n\n\"To return to your ladies--I hear they are lovely. What a wretched\nidea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army\nis in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants,\nnow--that\'s another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know\nus better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome,\nWarsaw, all the world\'s capitals.... We are feared, but we are\nloved. We are nice to know. And then the Emperor...\" he began, but\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\"The Emperor,\" Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and\nembarrassed, \"is the Emperor...?\"\n\n\"The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius--that\'s\nwhat the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure\nyou I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant\ncount.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I\ncould not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has\ncovered France. When I understood what he wanted--when I saw that he\nwas preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself:\n\'That is a monarch,\' and I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes,\nmon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages past or future.\"\n\n\"Is he in Moscow?\" Pierre stammered with a guilty look.\n\nThe Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.\n\n\"No, he will make his entry tomorrow,\" he replied, and continued his\ntalk.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at\nthe gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Wurttemberg hussars\nhad come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the\ncaptain\'s horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because\nthe hussars did not understand what was said to them in French.\n\nThe captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern\nvoice asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding\nofficer, and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that\nwere already occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the\ntwo first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his\ncommanding officer, but in reply to the third question which he did\nnot understand said, introducing broken French into his own German,\nthat he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had\nordered him to occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who\nknew German, translated what the German said to the captain and gave\nthe captain\'s reply to the Wurttemberg hussar in German. When he had\nunderstood what was said to him, the German submitted and took his men\nelsewhere. The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in\na loud voice.\n\nWhen he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as\nbefore, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He\nreally was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and\nhe was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the\nposition he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that\nthe happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him.\nPainful as that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the\nmoment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The\nfew glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this\ngood-natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which\nhe had spent the last few days and which was essential for the\nexecution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were\nready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still\nconsidered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the\nevildoer, but now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know\nwhy, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his\nintention. He struggled against the confession of his weakness but\ndimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy\nframe of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice,\nhad been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met.\n\nThe captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a\ntune.\n\nThe Frenchman\'s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now\nrepelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture\nwith which he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. \"I\nwill go away immediately. I won\'t say another word to him,\" thought\nPierre. He thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange\nfeeling of weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go\naway, but could not do so.\n\nThe captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up\nand down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as\nif he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.\n\n\"The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful,\" he suddenly\nsaid. \"He\'s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he\'s a\nGerman.\" He sat down facing Pierre. \"By the way, you know German,\nthen?\"\n\nPierre looked at him in silence.\n\n\"What is the German for \'shelter\'?\"\n\n\"Shelter?\" Pierre repeated. \"The German for shelter is Unterkunft.\"\n\n\"How do you say it?\" the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.\n\n\"Unterkunft,\" Pierre repeated.\n\n\"Onterkoff,\" said the captain and looked at Pierre for some\nseconds with laughing eyes. \"These Germans are first-rate fools, don\'t\nyou think so, Monsieur Pierre?\" he concluded.\n\n\"Well, let\'s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall\nwe? Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!\" he called out\ngaily.\n\nMorel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at\nPierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled\nexpression on his companion\'s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress\nand sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.\n\n\"There now, we\'re sad,\" said he, touching Pierre\'s hand. \"Have I\nupset you? No, really, have you anything against me?\" he asked Pierre.\n\"Perhaps it\'s the state of affairs?\"\n\nPierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman\'s\neyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.\n\n\"Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for\nyou. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and\ndeath. I say it with my hand on my heart!\" said he, striking his\nchest.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Pierre.\n\nThe captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned\nthat \"shelter\" was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly\nbrightened.\n\n\"Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!\" he cried gaily,\nfilling two glasses with wine.\n\nPierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied\nhis too, again pressed Pierre\'s hand, and leaned his elbows on the\ntable in a pensive attitude.\n\n\"Yes, my dear friend,\" he began, \"such is fortune\'s caprice. Who\nwould have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons\nin the service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am\nin Moscow with him. I must tell you, mon cher,\" he continued in the\nsad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story,\n\"that our name is one of the most ancient in France.\"\n\nAnd with a Frenchman\'s easy and naive frankness the captain told\nPierre the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and\nmanhood, and all about his relations and his financial and family\naffairs, \"ma pauvre mere\" playing of course an important part in the\nstory.\n\n\"But all that is only life\'s setting, the real thing is love--love! Am\nI not right, Monsieur Pierre?\" said he, growing animated. \"Another\nglass?\"\n\nPierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.\n\n\"Oh, women, women!\" and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at\nPierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.\n\nThere were very many of these, as one could easily believe,\nlooking at the officer\'s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the\neager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe\'s\nlove stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the\nspecial charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such\nsincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the\ncharm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre\nlistened to him with curiosity.\n\nIt was plain that l\'amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not\nthat low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor\nwas it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for\nNatasha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the\none he considered the \"love of clodhoppers\" and the other the \"love of\nsimpletons.\") L\'amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted\nprincipally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a\ncombination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.\n\nThus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a\nfascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a\ncharming, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching\nmarquise. The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the\ndaughter, ending in the mother\'s sacrificing herself and offering\nher daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the\ncaptain, though it was the memory of a distant past. Then he recounted\nan episode in which the husband played the part of the lover, and\nhe--the lover--assumed the role of the husband, as well as several\ndroll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where \"shelter\"\nis called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the\nyoung girls are \"too blonde.\"\n\nFinally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain\'s\nmemory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face,\nwas of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving\nof life continually occurred in the captain\'s stories) and the Pole\nhad entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de coeur) while\nhimself entering the French service. The captain was happy, the\nenchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by\nmagnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as\nhe did so: \"I have saved your life, and I save your honor!\" Having\nrepeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a\nshake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this\ntouching recollection.\n\nListening to the captain\'s tales, Pierre--as often happens late in\nthe evening and under the influence of wine--followed all that was\ntold him, understood it all, and at the same time followed a train\nof personal memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his\nmind. While listening to these love stories his own love for Natasha\nunexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that\nlove in his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe\'s\ntales. Listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty,\nPierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting\nwith the object of his love at the Sukharev water tower. At the time\nof that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him--he had not\neven once recalled it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting\nhad had in it something very important and poetic.\n\n\"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you,\" he now seemed\nto hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes,\nher smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and\nthere seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.\n\nHaving finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the\ncaptain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to\nsacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate\nhusband.\n\nChallenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need\nto express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that\nhe understood love for a women somewhat differently. He said that in\nall his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she\ncould never be his.\n\n\"Tiens!\" said the captain.\n\nPierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest\nyears, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too\nyoung, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.\nAfterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think\nof her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything\nin the world, and especially therefore above himself.\n\nWhen he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether\nhe understood that.\n\nThe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not\nunderstand it he begged Pierre to continue.\n\n\"Platonic love, clouds...\" he muttered.\n\nWhether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or\nthe thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of\nthose who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these\nthings together, something loosened Pierre\'s tongue. Speaking\nthickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the whole\nstory of his life: his marriage, Natasha\'s love for his best friend,\nher betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her.\nUrged on by Ramballe\'s questions he also told what he had at first\nconcealed--his own position and even his name.\n\nMore than anything else in Pierre\'s story the captain was\nimpressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in\nMoscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city,\nbut remained there concealing his name and station.\n\nWhen it was late at night they went out together into the street.\nThe night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokrovka\na fire glowed--the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To\nthe right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and\nopposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in\nPierre\'s heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerasim, the cook, and\ntwo Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible\nremarks in two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow\nseen in the town.\n\nThere was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the\nimmense city.\n\nGazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the\nglow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. \"There now,\nhow good it is, what more does one need?\" thought he. And suddenly\nremembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he\nleaned against the fence to save himself from falling.\n\nWithout taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with\nunsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and\nimmediately fell asleep.');

They had started so late on the first of September, the road\nhad been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been\nforgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided\nto spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next\nmorning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they\nonly got as far as Great Mytishchi. At ten o\'clock that evening the\nRostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed\nin the yards and huts of that large village. The Rostovs\' servants and\ncoachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to\ntheir masters, had supper, fed the horses, and came out into the\nporches.\n\nIn a neighboring hut lay Raevski\'s adjutant with a fractured\nwrist. The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and\npiteously, and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the\nautumn night. He had spent the first night in the same yard as the\nRostovs. The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on\naccount of his moaning, and at Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut\nsimply to be farther away from the wounded man.\n\nIn the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above\nthe high body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow\nof another fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew\nthat it was Little Mytishchi burning--set on fire by Mamonov\'s\nCossacks.\n\n\"But look here, brothers, there\'s another fire!\" remarked an\norderly.\n\nAll turned their attention to the glow.\n\n\"But they told us Little Mytishchi had been set on fire by Mamonov\'s\nCossacks.\"\n\n\"But that\'s not Mytishchi, it\'s farther away.\"\n\n\"Look, it must be in Moscow!\"\n\nTwo of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and\nsat down on its steps.\n\n\"It\'s more to the left, why, Little Mytishchi is over there, and\nthis is right on the other side.\"\n\nSeveral men joined the first two.\n\n\"See how it\'s flaring,\" said one. \"That\'s a fire in Moscow: either\nin the Sushchevski or the Rogozhski quarter.\"\n\nNo one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed\nsilently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.\n\nOld Daniel Terentich, the count\'s valet (as he was called), came\nup to the group and shouted at Mishka.\n\n\"What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be\ncalling and there\'s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.\"\n\n\"I only ran out to get some water,\" said Mishka.\n\n\"But what do you think, Daniel Terentich? Doesn\'t it look as if that\nglow were in Moscow?\" remarked one of the footmen.\n\nDaniel Terentich made no reply, and again for a long time they\nwere all silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and\nfarther still.\n\n\"God have mercy.... It\'s windy and dry...\" said another voice.\n\n\"Just look! See what it\'s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the\ncrows flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!\"\n\n\"They\'ll put it out, no fear!\"\n\n\"Who\'s to put it out?\" Daniel Terentich, who had hitherto been\nsilent, was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. \"Moscow\nit is, brothers,\" said he. \"Mother Moscow, the white...\" his voice\nfaltered, and he gave way to an old man\'s sob.\n\nAnd it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the\nsignificance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were\nheard, words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count\'s old valet.');

The count donned his dressing gown and went out to\nlook. Sonya and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out\nwith him. Only Natasha and the countess remained in the room. Petya\nwas no longer with the family, he had gone on with his regiment\nwhich was making for Troitsa.\n\nThe countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry.\nNatasha, pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the\nicons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to\nher father\'s words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of\nthe adjutant, three houses off.\n\n\"Oh, how terrible,\" said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and\nfrightened. \"I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there\'s an awful\nglow! Natasha, do look! You can see it from the window,\" she said to\nher cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.\n\nBut Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to\nher and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had\nbeen in this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sonya, to the\nsurprise and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable\nreason found it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew\'s wound and\nof his being with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry\nwith anyone as she was with Sonya. Sonya had cried and begged to be\nforgiven and now, as if trying to atone for her fault, paid\nunceasing attention to her cousin.\n\n\"Look, Natasha, how dreadfully it is burning!\" said she.\n\n\"What\'s burning?\" asked Natasha. \"Oh, yes, Moscow.\"\n\nAnd as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her, she\nturned her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was\nevident that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her\nformer attitude.\n\n\"But you didn\'t see it!\"\n\n\"Yes, really I did,\" Natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be\nleft in peace.\n\nBoth the countess and Sonya understood that, naturally, neither\nMoscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of\nimportance to Natasha.\n\nThe count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess\nwent up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand\nas she was wont to do when Natasha was ill, then touched her\nforehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and\nfinally kissed her.\n\n\"You are cold. You are trembling all over. You\'d better lie down,\"\nsaid the countess.\n\n\"Lie down? All right, I will. I\'ll lie down at once,\" said Natasha.\n\nWhen Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was\nseriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first\nasked many questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it\nserious? And could she see him? But after she had been told that she\ncould not see him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was\nnot in danger, she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all,\nevidently disbelieving what they told her, and convinced that say what\nshe might she would still be told the same. All the way she had sat\nmotionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the\nexpression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much,\nand now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated\nherself on arriving. She was planning something and either deciding or\nhad already decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but\nwhat it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.\n\n\"Natasha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.\"\n\nA bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame\nSchoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.\n\n\"No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,\" Natasha replied\nirritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open\nwindow the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She\nput her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her\nslim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame.\nNatasha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince\nAndrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut\nacross the passage; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her\nsob. The countess exchanged a look with Sonya.\n\n\"Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,\" said the countess, softly\ntouching Natasha\'s shoulders. \"Come, lie down.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes... I\'ll lie down at once,\" said Natasha, and began\nhurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.\n\nWhen she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket,\nshe sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made\nup on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the\nfront, and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers\nrapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved\nfrom side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked\nfixedly before her. When her toilet for the night was finished she\nsank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the\ndoor.\n\n\"Natasha, you\'d better lie in the middle,\" said Sonya.\n\n\"I\'ll stay here,\" muttered Natasha. \"Do lie down,\" she added\ncrossly, and buried her face in the pillow.\n\nThe countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undressed hastily and lay\ndown. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left\nin the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little\nMytishchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise\nof people shouting at a tavern Mamonov\'s Cossacks had set up across\nthe street, and the adjutant\'s unceasing moans could still be heard.\n\nFor a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds that\nreached her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First\nshe heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed\nunder her, then Madame Schoss\' familiar whistling snore and Sonya\'s\ngentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natasha. Natasha did not\nanswer.\n\n\"I think she\'s asleep, Mamma,\" said Sonya softly.\n\nAfter a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one\nreplied.\n\nSoon after that Natasha heard her mother\'s even breathing. Natasha\ndid not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the\nquilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.\n\nAs if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in\na crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near\nby. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of\nthe adjutant was heard. Natasha sat up.\n\n\"Sonya, are you asleep? Mamma?\" she whispered.\n\nNo one replied. Natasha rose slowly and carefully, crossed\nherself, and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her\nslim, supple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping\ncautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few\nsteps to the door and grasped the cold door handle.\n\nIt seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically\nagainst all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking\nwith alarm and terror and overflowing with love.\n\nShe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the\ncold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed\nher. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over\nhim, and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince\nAndrew lay. It was dark in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench\nbeside a bed on which something was lying, stood a tallow candle\nwith a long, thick, and smoldering wick.\n\nFrom the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew\'s\nwound and his presence there, Natasha had resolved to see him. She did\nnot know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but\nfelt the more convinced that it was necessary.\n\nAll day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now\nthat the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might\nsee. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that\nincessant moaning of the adjutant\'s? Yes, he was altogether like that.\nIn her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she\nsaw an indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised\nunder the quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there,\nand stood still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her\nforward. She cautiously took one step and then another, and found\nherself in the middle of a small room containing baggage. Another\nman--Timokhin--was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons,\nand two others--the doctor and a valet--lay on the floor.\n\nThe valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, kept awake by\nthe pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange\napparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and\nnightcap. The valet\'s sleepy, frightened exclamation, \"What do you\nwant? What\'s the matter?\" made Natasha approach more swiftly to what\nwas lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked,\nshe must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle\nwick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the\nquilt, and such as she had always seen him.\n\nHe was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his\nglittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his\nneck, delicate as a child\'s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his\nshirt, gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had\nnever seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift,\nflexible, youthful movement dropped on her knees.\n\nHe smiled and held out his hand to her.');

His feverish state and the\ninflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor\'s\nopinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with\npleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that\nhis temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.\nThe first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had\nremained in the caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself\nasked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his\nremoval into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose\nconsciousness. When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a\nlong time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened them and\nwhispered softly: \"And the tea?\" His remembering such a small detail\nof everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew\'s pulse,\nand to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He\nwas dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did\nnot die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering.\nTimokhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew\'s regiment, had\njoined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been\nwounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino. They were accompanied by\na doctor, Prince Andrew\'s valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.\n\nThey gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking\nwith feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to\nunderstand and remember something.\n\n\"I don\'t want any more. Is Timokhin here?\" he asked.\n\nTimokhin crept along the bench to him.\n\n\"I am here, your excellency.\"\n\n\"How\'s your wound?\"\n\n\"Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?\"\n\nPrince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.\n\n\"Couldn\'t one get a book?\" he asked.\n\n\"What book?\"\n\n\"The Gospels. I haven\'t one.\"\n\nThe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he\nwas feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly\nbut reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him\nas he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted\nthe cloak with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the\nnoisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began\nexamining that dreadful place. The doctor was very much displeased\nabout something and made a change in the dressings, turning the\nwounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and\ndelirious from the agony. He kept asking them to get him the book\nand put it under him.\n\n\"What trouble would it be to you?\" he said. \"I have not got one.\nPlease get it for me and put it under for a moment,\" he pleaded in a\npiteous voice.\n\nThe doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.\n\n\"You fellows have no conscience,\" said he to the valet who was\npouring water over his hands. \"For just one moment I didn\'t look after\nyou... It\'s such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.\"\n\n\"By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under\nhim!\" said the valet.\n\nThe first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was\nthe matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he\nasked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at\nMytishchi. After growing confused from pain while being carried into\nthe hut he again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once\nmore recalled all that had happened to him, and above all vividly\nremembered the moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of\nthe sufferings of a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to\nhim which promised him happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague\nand indefinite, again possessed his soul. He remembered that he had\nnow a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to\ndo with the Gospels. That was why he asked for a copy of them. The\nuncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over\nagain confused his thoughts, and when he came to himself a third\ntime it was in the complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him\nwas sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was\nshouting and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the\ntable, on the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the\nhead of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick of which\nwas charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.\n\nHis mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,\nfeels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the\npower and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which\nto fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from\nthe deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in\nand can then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew\'s\nmind was not in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of\nhis mind were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted\napart from his will. Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him\nsimultaneously. At times his brain suddenly began to work with a\nvigor, clearness, and depth it had never reached when he was in\nhealth, but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some\nunexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again.\n\n\"Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be\ndeprived,\" he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,\ngazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. \"A happiness\nlying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act\non man--a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving.\nEvery man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was\npossible only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was\nthe Son...?\"\n\nAnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince\nAndrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality)\na soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating\n\"piti-piti-piti,\" and then \"titi,\" and then again \"piti-piti-piti,\"\nand \"ti-ti\" once more. At the same time he felt that above his face,\nabove the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being\nerected out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this\nwhispered music. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it\nwas difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but\nnevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound\nof whispered rhythmic music--\"it stretches, stretches, spreading out\nand stretching,\" said Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to\nthis whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and\nthe construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a\nred halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and\nthe buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face.\nEach time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and\nyet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though it\nknocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But\nbesides this there was something else of importance. It was\nsomething white by the door--the statue of a sphinx, which also\noppressed him.\n\n\"But perhaps that\'s my shirt on the table,\" he thought, \"and\nthat\'s my legs, and that is the door, but why is it always\nstretching and drawing itself out, and \'piti-piti-piti\' and \'ti-ti\'\nand \'piti-piti-piti\'...? That\'s enough, please leave off!\" Prince\nAndrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings\nagain swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and\nforce.\n\n\"Yes--love,\" he thought again quite clearly. \"But not love which\nloves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some\nreason, but the love which I--while dying--first experienced when I\nsaw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love\nwhich is the very essence of the soul and does not require an\nobject. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one\'s neighbors, to\nlove one\'s enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His\nmanifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with\nhuman love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why\nI experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has\nbecome of him? Is he alive?...\n\n\"When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but\ndivine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can\ndestroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people\nhave I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as\nI did her.\" And he vividly pictured to himself Natasha, not as he\nhad done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him\ndelight, but for the first time picturing to himself her soul. And\nhe understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now\nunderstood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her,\nthe cruelty of his rupture with her. \"If only it were possible for\nme to see her once more! Just once, looking into those eyes to say...\"\n\n\n\"Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!\" flopped the\nfly... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a\nworld of reality and delirium in which something particular was\nhappening. In that world some structure was still being erected and\ndid not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle\nwith its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay\nnear the door; but besides all this something creaked, there was a\nwhiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the\ndoor. And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very\nNatasha of whom he had just been thinking.\n\n\"Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,\" thought Prince\nAndrew, trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face\nremained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer.\nPrince Andrew wished to return to that former world of pure thought,\nbut he could not, and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft\nwhispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed\nhim and stretched out, and the strange face was before him. Prince\nAndrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his\nsenses, he moved a little, and suddenly there was a ringing in his\nears, a dimness in his eyes, and like a man plunged into water he lost\nconsciousness. When he came to himself, Natasha, that same living\nNatasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure\ndivine love that had been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He\nrealized that it was the real living Natasha, and he was not surprised\nbut quietly happy. Natasha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to\nstir), with frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her\nsobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it\nsomething quivered.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.\n\n\"You?\" he said. \"How fortunate!\"\n\nWith a rapid but careful movement Natasha drew nearer to him on\nher knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and\nbegan kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.\n\"Forgive me!\"\n\n\"I love you,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"Forgive...!\"\n\n\"Forgive what?\" he asked.\n\n\"Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!\" faltered Natasha in a\nscarcely audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more\nrapidly, just touching it with her lips.\n\n\"I love you more, better than before,\" said Prince Andrew, lifting\nher face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.\n\nThose eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,\ncompassionately, and with joyous love. Natasha\'s thin pale face,\nwith its swollen lips, was more than plain--it was dreadful. But\nPrince Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were\nbeautiful. They heard the sound of voices behind them.\n\nPeter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.\nTimokhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had\nlong been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his\nbare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.\n\n\"What\'s this?\" said the doctor, rising from his bed. \"Please go\naway, madam!\"\n\nAt that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her\ndaughter\'s absence, knocked at the door.\n\nLike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out of the\nroom and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.\n\n\nFrom that time, during all the rest of the Rostovs\' journey, at\nevery halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natasha never\nleft the wounded Bolkonski, and the doctor had to admit that he had\nnot expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in\nnursing a wounded man.\n\nDreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew\ndie in her daughter\'s arms during the journey--as, judging by what the\ndoctor said, it seemed might easily happen--she could not oppose\nNatasha. Though with the intimacy now established between the\nwounded man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover\ntheir former engagement would be renewed, no one--least of all Natasha\nand Prince Andrew--spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and\ndeath, which hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia, shut\nout all other considerations.');

His head was aching,\nthe clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt\nuncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of\nsomething shameful he had done the day before. That something shameful\nwas his yesterday\'s conversation with Captain Ramballe.\n\nIt was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of\ndoors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an\nengraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table, he\nremembered where he was and what lay before him that very day.\n\n\"Am I not too late?\" he thought. \"No, probably he won\'t make his\nentry into Moscow before noon.\"\n\nPierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him,\nbut hastened to act.\n\nAfter arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to\ngo out. But it then occurred to him for the first time that he\ncertainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the\nstreets. It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his\nwide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his\narm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not had time to\nreload it. \"No matter, dagger will do,\" he said to himself, though\nwhen planning his design he had more than once come to the\nconclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been\nto try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as his chief aim\nconsisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself\nthat he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could\nto achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a\ngreen sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the\npistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.\n\nHaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his\nhead, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or\nmeeting the captain, and passed out into the street.\n\nThe conflagration, at which he had looked with so much\nindifference the evening before, had greatly increased during the\nnight. Moscow was on fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage\nRow, across the river, in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as the\nbarges on the Moskva River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov\nBridge, were all ablaze.\n\nPierre\'s way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from there\nto the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat, where he had long before\ndecided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses\nwere locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.\nThe air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he\nmet Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air\nnot of the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets.\nBoth the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise.\nBesides his height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of\nsuffering in his face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre\nbecause they could not make out to what class he could belong. The\nFrench followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because\nPierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with\nfear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of one\nhouse three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians\nwho did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know\nFrench.\n\nPierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel\nstanding beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the\nshout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man\'s\nmusket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on\nthe other side of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what\nwent on around him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror\nand haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the\nprevious night\'s experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was\nnot destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had\nhe not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not\nnow have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than\nfour hours previously on his way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the\nKremlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal\nstudy in the Kremlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to\nmeasures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent\nlooting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know\nthis; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was\ntortured--as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is\nimpossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its\nincompatibility with their natures--by the fear of weakening at the\ndecisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.\n\nThough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by\ninstinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the\nPovarskoy.\n\nAs Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and\ndenser--he even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues\nof flame rose from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people\nin the streets and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt\nthat something unusual was happening around him, did not realize that\nhe was approaching the fire. As he was going along a foot path across\na wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens\nof Prince Gruzinski\'s house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the\ndesperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening\nfrom a dream and lifted his head.\n\nBy the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of\nhousehold goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and\ntrunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer\nyoung, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and\ncap. This woman, swaying to and fro and muttering something, was\nchoking with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty\nshort frocks and cloaks, were staring at their mother with a look of\nstupefaction on their pale frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy\nof about seven, who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently\nnot his own, was crying in his old nurse\'s arms. A dirty, barefooted\nmaid was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her pale-colored\nplait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair. The\nwoman\'s husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the undress\nuniform of a civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and\nshowing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward\nover his temples, with expressionless face was moving the trunks,\nwhich were placed one on another, and was dragging some garments\nfrom under them.\n\nAs soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his\nfeet.\n\n\"Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends...\nhelp us, somebody,\" she muttered between her sobs. \"My girl... My\ndaughter! My youngest daughter is left behind. She\'s burned! Ooh!\nWas it for this I nursed you.... Ooh!\"\n\n\"Don\'t, Mary Nikolievna!\" said her husband to her in a low voice,\nevidently only to justify himself before the stranger. \"Sister must\nhave taken her, or else where can she be?\" he added.\n\n\"Monster! Villain!\" shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to\nweep. \"You have no heart, you don\'t feel for your own child! Another\nman would have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and\nneither a man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,\" she\nwent on, addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. \"The fire broke\nout alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out \'Fire!\' and we\nrushed to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is\nwhat we have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the\nrest is lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O\nLord!...\" and again she began to sob. \"My child, my dear one!\nBurned, burned!\"\n\n\"But where was she left?\" asked Pierre.\n\nFrom the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man\nmight help her.\n\n\"Oh, dear sir!\" she cried, seizing him by the legs. \"My\nbenefactor, set my heart at ease.... Aniska, go, you horrid girl, show\nhim the way!\" she cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and\nstill farther exposing her long teeth.\n\n\"Show me the way, show me, I... I\'ll do it,\" gasped Pierre rapidly.\n\nThe dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her\nplait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre\nfelt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his\nhead higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift\nsteps he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the\nPovarskoy. The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues\nof flame here and there broke through that cloud. A great number of\npeople crowded in front of the conflagration. In the middle of the\nstreet stood a French general saying something to those around him.\nPierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing to the spot where the\ngeneral stood, but the French soldiers stopped him.\n\n\"On ne passe pas!\"* cried a voice.\n\n\n*\"You can\'t pass!\"\n\n\n\"This way, uncle,\" cried the girl. \"We\'ll pass through the side\nstreet, by the Nikulins\'!\"\n\nPierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with\nher. She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left,\nand, passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.\n\n\"It\'s here, close by,\" said she and, running across the yard, opened\na gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small\nwooden wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One\nof its sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames\nissued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof.\n\nAs Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air\nand involuntarily stopped.\n\n\"Which is it? Which is your house?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ooh!\" wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. \"That\'s it, that was\nour lodging. You\'ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my\nprecious little missy! Ooh!\" lamented Aniska, who at the sight of\nthe fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings.\n\nPierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he\ninvoluntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house\nthat was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and\naround which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not\nrealize what these men, who were dragging something out, were about;\nbut seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber\nand trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that\nlooting was going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.\n\nThe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings,\nthe whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the\npeople, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick\nblack clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here\nand there dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish\nscales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke and\nrapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating effects\nof a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because\nat the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas\nthat had weighed him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and\nresolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to\ndash into that part of it which was still standing, when just above\nhis head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound\nand the ring of something heavy falling close beside him.\n\nPierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some\nFrenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with\nmetal articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the\ndrawer.\n\n\"What does this fellow want?\" shouted one of them referring to\nPierre.\n\n\"There\'s a child in that house. Haven\'t you seen a child?\" cried\nPierre.\n\n\"What\'s he talking about? Get along!\" said several voices, and one\nof the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take\nfrom them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved\nthreateningly toward him.\n\n\"A child?\" shouted a Frenchman from above. \"I did hear something\nsquealing in the garden. Perhaps it\'s his brat that the fellow is\nlooking for. After all, one must be human, you know....\"\n\n\"Where is it? Where?\" said Pierre.\n\n\"There! There!\" shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the\ngarden at the back of the house. \"Wait a bit--I\'m coming down.\"\n\nAnd a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with\na spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window\non the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with\nhim into the garden.\n\n\"Hurry up, you others!\" he called out to his comrades. \"It\'s getting\nhot.\"\n\nWhen they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman\npulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space\nwhere a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.\n\n\"There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!\" said the\nFrenchman. \"Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you\nknow!\" and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his\ncomrades.\n\nBreathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going\nto take her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly,\nscrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her mother, began to\nyell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his\narms. She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little\nhands to pull Pierre\'s hands away and to bite them with her slobbering\nmouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he\nhad experienced when touching some nasty little animal. But he made an\neffort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large\nhouse. It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he had\ncome; the maid, Aniska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a feeling\nof pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully sobbing child to\nhimself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden\nseeking another way out.');

He did not at first recognize the place from which he had\nset out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and\ngoods that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian\nfamilies who had taken refuge here from the fire with their\nbelongings, there were several French soldiers in a variety of\nclothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried to find the family\nof that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother\nand go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to\ndo and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from running, he\nfelt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth,\nanimation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to\nsave the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging with her little\nhands to Pierre\'s coat, sat on his arm gazing about her like some\nlittle wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight\nsmile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that\nfrightened, sickly little face.\n\nHe did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left\nthem. He walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various\nfaces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family\nconsisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,\ncloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar\ntype, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the\nperfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,\nblack eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,\nbeautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the\ncrowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright\nlilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown\nout onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the\nold woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless,\nlarge, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she\nwas aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck\nPierre and, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to\nlook at her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding\nthose he sought, he stopped and looked about him.\n\nWith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous\nthan before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered\nabout him.\n\n\"Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You\'re of the gentry\nyourself, aren\'t you? Whose child is it?\" they asked him.\n\nPierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat\nwho had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked\nwhether anyone knew where she had gone.\n\n\"Why, that must be the Anferovs,\" said an old deacon, addressing a\npockmarked peasant woman. \"Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!\" he added\nin his customary bass.\n\n\"The Anferovs? No,\" said the woman. \"They left in the morning.\nThat must be either Mary Nikolievna\'s or the Ivanovs\'!\"\n\n\"He says \'a woman,\' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady,\" remarked a house\nserf.\n\n\"Do you know her? She\'s thin, with long teeth,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"That\'s Mary Nikolievna! They went inside the garden when these\nwolves swooped down,\" said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.\n\n\"O Lord, have mercy!\" added the deacon.\n\n\"Go over that way, they\'re there. It\'s she! She kept on lamenting\nand crying,\" continued the woman. \"It\'s she. Here, this way!\"\n\nBut Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds\nbeen intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was\nlooking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone\nup to them. One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat\ntied round the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and\nhis feet were bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck\nPierre, was a long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in\nhis movements and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a\nwoman\'s loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian\nboots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the\nArmenians and, saying something, immediately seized the old man by his\nlegs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in\nthe frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and\nwith his hands in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and\nsilent.\n\n\"Here, take the child!\" said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to\nthe woman, handing the little girl to her. \"Give her back to them,\ngive her back!\" he almost shouted, putting the child, who began\nscreaming, on the ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the\nArmenian family.\n\nThe old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had\nsecured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.\nThe old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre\ncaught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to\nthe Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from\nside to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands\nfrom his pockets had seized her by the neck.\n\nThe beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same\nattitude, with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or\nfeel what the soldier was doing to her.\n\nWhile Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the\nFrenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing\nfrom her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the\nyoung woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.\n\n\"Let that woman alone!\" exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious\nvoice, seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him\naside.\n\nThe soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing\ndown the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward\nPierre.\n\n\"Voyons, Pas de betises!\"* he cried.\n\n\n*\"Look here, no nonsense!\"\n\n\nPierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing\nand his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted\nFrenchman and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked\nhim off his feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval\nwere heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted\npatrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans\ncame up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them.\nPierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only\nremembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that\nhis hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood\naround him and were searching him.\n\n\"Lieutenant, he has a dagger,\" were the first words Pierre\nunderstood.\n\n\"Ah, a weapon?\" said the officer and turned to the barefooted\nsoldier who had been arrested with Pierre. \"All right, you can tell\nall about it at the court-martial.\" Then he turned to Pierre. \"Do\nyou speak French?\"\n\nPierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply.\nHis face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something\nin a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves\non both sides of Pierre.\n\n\"Do you speak French?\" the officer asked again, keeping at a\ndistance from Pierre. \"Call the interpreter.\"\n\nA little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks,\nand by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to\nbe a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.\n\n\"He does not look like a common man,\" said the interpreter, after\na searching look at Pierre.\n\n\"Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,\" remarked the officer.\n\"And ask him who he is,\" he added.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the interpreter in poor Russian. \"You must\nanswer the chief.\"\n\n\"I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner--take me!\"\nPierre suddenly replied in French.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" muttered the officer with a frown. \"Well then, march!\"\n\nA crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood\nthe pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol\nstarted she moved forward.\n\n\"Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?\" said she. \"And the\nlittle girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she\'s not\ntheirs?\" said the woman.\n\n\"What does that woman want?\" asked the officer.\n\nPierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight\nof the little girl he had saved.\n\n\"What does she want?\" he murmured. \"She is bringing me my daughter\nwhom I have just saved from the flames,\" said he. \"Good-by!\" And\nwithout knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along\nwith resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.\n\nThe French patrol was one of those sent out through the various\nstreets of Moscow by Durosnel\'s order to put a stop to the pillage,\nand especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general\nopinion which had that day originated among the higher French\nofficers, were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through\na number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects:\na small shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house\nserf, besides several looters. But of all these various suspected\ncharacters, Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all.\nWhen they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the\nZubov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed\napart under strict guard.');

But\nthe calm, luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about\nphantoms and reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made\nit hard, except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the\ndifficult position of the Russian people. There were the same\nreceptions and balls, the same French theater, the same court\ninterests and service interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the\nvery highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the\ndifficulties of the actual position. Stories were whispered of how\ndifferently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult\ncircumstances. The Empress Marya, concerned for the welfare of the\ncharitable and educational institutions under her patronage, had given\ndirections that they should all be removed to Kazan, and the things\nbelonging to these institutions had already been packed up. The\nEmpress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions she would\nbe pleased to give--with her characteristic Russian patriotism had\nreplied that she could give no directions about state institutions for\nthat was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally was\nconcerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.\n\nAt Anna Pavlovna\'s on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of\nthe battle of Borodino, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which\nwas to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when\nsending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was\nregarded as a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince\nVasili himself, famed for his elocution, was to read it. (He used to\nread at the Empress\'.) The art of his reading was supposed to lie in\nrolling out the words, quite independently of their meaning, in a loud\nand singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a\ntender murmur, so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and\nthe murmur on another. This reading, as was always the case at Anna\nPavlovna\'s soirees, had a political significance. That evening she\nexpected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of\ntheir visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic\ntemper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna Pavlovna, not\nyet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room, did not\nlet the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general\nconversation.\n\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess\nBezukhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously,\nhad missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament, and\nwas said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated\nPetersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to\nsome Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way.\n\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting countess\' illness\narose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at\nthe same time, and that the Italian\'s cure consisted in removing\nsuch inconvenience; but in Anna Pavlovna\'s presence no one dared to\nthink of this or even appear to know it.\n\n\"They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is\nangina pectoris.\"\n\n\"Angina? Oh, that\'s a terrible illness!\"\n\n\"They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...\"\nand the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.\n\n\"The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the\ndoctor told him the case was dangerous.\"\n\n\"Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.\"\n\n\"You are speaking of the poor countess?\" said Anna Pavlovna,\ncoming up just then. \"I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a\nlittle better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the\nworld,\" she went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. \"We belong to\ndifferent camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she\ndeserves. She is very unfortunate!\" added Anna Pavlovna.\n\nSupposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting the\nveil from the secret of the countess\' malady, an unwary young man\nventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been\ncalled in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan\nwho might employ dangerous remedies.\n\n\"Your information maybe better than mine,\" Anna Pavlovna suddenly\nand venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, \"but I know on\ngood authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He\nis private physician to the Queen of Spain.\"\n\nAnd having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pavlovna turned to\nanother group where Bilibin was talking about the Austrians: having\nwrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again\nand utter one of his mots.\n\n\"I think it is delightful,\" he said, referring to a diplomatic\nnote that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners\ncaptured from the French by Wittgenstein, \"the hero of Petropol\" as he\nwas then called in Petersburg.\n\n\"What? What\'s that?\" asked Anna Pavlovna, securing silence for the\nmot, which she had heard before.\n\nAnd Bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch,\nwhich he had himself composed.\n\n\"The Emperor returns these Austrian banners,\" said Bilibin,\n\"friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,\" and his brow\nbecame smooth again.\n\n\"Charming, charming!\" observed Prince Vasili.\n\n\"The path to Warsaw, perhaps,\" Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly\nand unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he\nmeant. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise.\nHe knew no more than the others what his words meant. During his\ndiplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances\nwere received as very witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in\nthat way the first words that entered his head. \"It may turn out\nvery well,\" he thought, \"but if not, they\'ll know how to arrange\nmatters.\" And really, during the awkward silence that ensued, that\ninsufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been\nwaiting for and wished to convert, and she, smiling and shaking a\nfinger at Hippolyte, invited Prince Vasili to the table and bringing\nhim two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone\nbecame silent.\n\n\n\"Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!\" Prince Vasili sternly\ndeclaimed, looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether\nanyone had anything to say to the contrary. But no one said\nanything. \"Moscow, our ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives\nher Christ\"--he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her--\"as a mother\nreceives her zealous sons into her arms, and through the gathering\nmists, foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule, sings in\nexultation, \'Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh!\'\"\n\n\nPrince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.\n\nBilibin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present\nappeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna\nPavlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman\nmuttering the prayer at Communion: \"Let the bold and insolent\nGoliath...\" she whispered.\n\nPrince Vasili continued.\n\n\n\"Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France\nencompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble\nFaith, the sling of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head\nin his bloodthirsty pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the\nservant of God and zealous champion of old of our country\'s weal, is\noffered to Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength\nprevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence. I\nraise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race\nof the just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.\"\n\n\n\"What force! What a style!\" was uttered in approval both of reader\nand of author.\n\nAnimated by that address Anna Pavlovna\'s guests talked for a long\ntime of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as\nto the result of the battle to be fought in a few days.\n\n\"You will see,\" said Anna Pavlovna, \"that tomorrow, on the Emperor\'s\nbirthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!\"');

Next day\nduring the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor\'s\nbirthday, Prince Volkonski was called out of the church and received a\ndispatch from Prince Kutuzov. It was Kutuzov\'s report, written from\nTatarinova on the day of the battle. Kutuzov wrote that the Russians\nhad not retreated a step, that the French losses were much heavier\nthan ours, and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle\nbefore collecting full information. It followed that there must have\nbeen a victory. And at once, without leaving the church, thanks were\nrendered to the Creator for His help and for the victory.\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a\njoyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the\nvictory to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon\'s\nhaving been captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new\nruler for France.\n\nIt is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real\nstrength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far\nfrom the scene of action. General events involuntarily group\nthemselves around some particular incident. So now the courtiers\'\npleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on\nthe Emperor\'s birthday as on the fact of the victory itself. It was\nlike a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was made in Kutuzov\'s\nreport of the Russian losses, among which figured the names of\nTuchkov, Bagration, and Kutaysov. In the Petersburg world this sad\nside of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single\nincident: Kutaysov\'s death. Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked him,\nand he was young and interesting. That day everyone met with the\nwords:\n\n\"What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a\nloss Kutaysov is! How sorry I am!\"\n\n\"What did I tell about Kutuzov?\" Prince Vasili now said with a\nprophet\'s pride. \"I always said he was the only man capable of\ndefeating Napoleon.\"\n\nBut next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood\ngrew anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the\nsuspense occasioned the Emperor.\n\n\"Fancy the Emperor\'s position!\" said they, and instead of\nextolling Kutuzov as they had done the day before, they condemned\nhim as the cause of the Emperor\'s anxiety. That day Prince Vasili no\nlonger boasted of his protege Kutuzov, but remained silent when the\ncommander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if\neverything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy,\na terrible piece of news was added. Countess Helene Bezukhova had\nsuddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to\nmention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone said that\nCountess Bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris,\nbut in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private\nphysician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a\ncertain drug to produce a certain effect; but Helene, tortured by\nthe fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom\nshe had written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied,\nhad suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in\nagony before assistance could be rendered her. It was said that Prince\nVasili and the old count had turned upon the Italian, but the latter\nhad produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they\nhad immediately let the matter drop.\n\nTalk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor\'s\nlack of news, the loss of Kutuzov, and the death of Helene.\n\nOn the third day after Kutuzov\'s report a country gentleman\narrived from Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French\nspread through the whole town. This was terrible! What a position\nfor the Emperor to be in! Kutuzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasili\nduring the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his\ndaughter\'s death said of Kutuzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was\nexcusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said), that it\nwas impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old\nman.\n\n\"I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted\nto such a man.\"\n\nAs long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt\nit, but the next day the following communication was received from\nCount Rostopchin:\n\n\nPrince Kutuzov\'s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he\ndemands police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road. He\nwrites that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutuzov\'s\naction decides the fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will\nshudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness\nis centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall\nfollow the army. I have had everything removed, and it only remains\nfor me to weep over the fate of my fatherland.\n\n\nOn receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to\nKutuzov with the following rescript:\n\n\nPrince Michael Ilarionovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have\nreceived no communication from you, yet on the first of September I\nreceived from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslavl, the sad\nnews that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You\ncan yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your\nsilence increases my astonishment. I am sending this by\nAdjutant-General Prince Volkonski, to hear from you the situation of\nthe army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy\ndecision.');

This messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know\nRussian, but who was quoique etranger, russe de coeur et d\'ame,* as he\nsaid of himself.\n\n\n*Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.\n\n\nThe Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the\npalace on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before\nthe campaign and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as\nhe wrote) when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain*\nwith the news of the burning of Moscow, dont les flammes eclairaient\nsa route.*[2]\n\n\n*Our most gracious sovereign.\n\n*[2] Whose flames illumined his route.\n\n\nThough the source of M.

I left it all in flames,\"\nreplied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he\nwas frightened by what he had done.\n\nThe Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip\ntrembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.\n\nBut this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming\nhimself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in\na firm voice:\n\n\"I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence\nrequires great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in\nall things to His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the\narmy when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did\nyou not notice discouragement?...\"\n\nSeeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also\ngrew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor\'s\ndirect and relevant question which required a direct answer.\n\n\"Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal\nsoldier?\" he asked to gain time.\n\n\"Colonel, I always require it,\" replied the Emperor. \"Conceal\nnothing from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.\"\n\n\"Sire!\" said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on\nhis lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, \"sire, I left\nthe whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without\nexception in desperate and agonized terror...\"\n\n\"How is that?\" the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. \"Would\nmisfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!\"\n\nMichaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had\nprepared.\n\n\"Sire,\" he said, with respectful playfulness, \"they are only\nafraid lest Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should\nallow yourself to be persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the\ncombat,\" declared this representative of the Russian nation, \"and to\nprove to Your Majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they\nare....\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his\neyes, he patted Michaud on the shoulder. \"You set me at ease,\nColonel.\"\n\nHe bent his head and was silent for some time.\n\n\"Well, then, go back to the army,\" he said, drawing himself up to\nhis full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic\ngesture, \"and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you\ngo that when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the\nhead of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last\nresources of my empire.

The tales and\ndescriptions of that time without exception speak only of the\nself-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, and the heroism of\nthe Russians. But it was not really so. It appears so to us because we\nsee only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all\nthe personal human interests that people had. Yet in reality those\npersonal interests of the moment so much transcend the general\ninterests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt\nor even noticed. Most of the people at that time paid no attention\nto the general progress of events but were guided only by their\nprivate interests, and they were the very people whose activities at\nthat period were most useful.\n\nThose who tried to understand the general course of events and to\ntake part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless\nmembers of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they\ndid for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish--like\nPierre\'s and Mamonov\'s regiments which looted Russian villages, and\nthe lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded,\nand so on. Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing\ntheir feelings, who discussed Russia\'s position at the time\ninvoluntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of\npretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed\nagainst people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty\nof. In historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of\nthe Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable. Only unconscious action\nbears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never\nunderstands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts\nare fruitless.\n\nThe more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place\nin Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg\nand in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and\ngentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital\nand talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which\nretired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow,\nand when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be\navenged on the French, but they thought about their next pay, their\nnext quarters, of Matreshka the vivandiere, and like matters.\n\nAs the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostov took a\nclose and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so\ncasually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked\nat what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally\nracking his brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the\nstate of Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to\nthink about it, that Kutuzov and others were there for that purpose,\nbut that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their\nfull strength, that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet,\nand that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of\na regiment in a couple of years\' time.\n\nAs he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being\nsent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without\nregret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but\nwith the greatest pleasure--which he did not conceal and which his\ncomrades fully understood.\n\nA few days before the battle of Borodino, Nicholas received the\nnecessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in\nadvance, he set out with post horses for Voronezh.\n\nOnly a man who has experienced it--that is, has passed some months\ncontinuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war--can understand\nthe delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by\nthe army\'s foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals.\nWhen--free from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp--he\nsaw villages with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen\'s country\nhouses, fields where cattle were grazing, posthouses with\nstationmasters asleep in them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this\nfor the first time. What for a long while specially surprised and\ndelighted him were the women, young and healthy, without a dozen\nofficers making up to each of them; women, too, who were pleased and\nflattered that a passing officer should joke with them.\n\nIn the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in\nVoronezh, ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and\nnext day, very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not\nworn for a long time, went to present himself to the authorities.\n\nThe commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man\nwho was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He\nreceived Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically\nmilitary) and questioned him with an important air, as if\nconsidering the general progress of affairs and approving and\ndisapproving with full right to do so. Nicholas was in such good\nspirits that this merely amused him.\n\nFrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The\ngovernor was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated\nthe stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended\nto him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out\nof town who had the best horses, and promised to assist him in every\nway.\n\n\"You are Count Ilya Rostov\'s son? My wife was a great friend of your\nmother\'s. We are at home on Thursdays--today is Thursday, so please\ncome and see us quite informally,\" said the governor, taking leave\nof him.\n\nImmediately on leaving the governor\'s, Nicholas hired post horses\nand, taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop\nto the landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything\nseemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay\nin Voronezh and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant\nstate of mind, everything went well and easily.\n\nThe landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old\ncavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some\ncentury-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery\nwhere he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses.\n\nIn very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six\nthousand rubles--to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.\nAfter dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine,\nNicholas--having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was\nalready on the friendliest terms--galloped back over abominable roads,\nin the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as\nto be in time for the governor\'s party.\n\nWhen he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented\nhimself, Nicholas arrived at the governor\'s rather late, but with\nthe phrase \"better late than never\" on his lips.\n\nIt was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew\nthat Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the\nclavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come\nas to a ball.\n\nProvincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this\ndifference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the\narrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything\nthat went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was\nnoticeable, an \"in for a penny, in for a pound--who cares?\" spirit,\nand the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and\nmutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.\n\nThe society gathered together at the governor\'s was the best in\nVoronezh.\n\nThere were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas\' Moscow\nacquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the\ncavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured\nand well-bred Count Rostov. Among the men was an Italian prisoner,\nan officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence\nof that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The\nItalian was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed\nto him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he\ntreated him cordially though with dignity and restraint.\n\nAs soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing\naround him a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the\nwords \"better late than never\" and heard them repeated several times\nby others, people clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he\nfelt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the\nprovince--that of a universal favorite: a very pleasant position,\nand intoxicatingly so after his long privations. At posting\nstations, at inns, and in the landowner\'s snuggery, maidservants had\nbeen flattered by his notice, and here too at the governor\'s party\nthere were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible number of\npretty young women, married and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his\nnotice. The women and girls flirted with him and, from the first\nday, the people concerned themselves to get this fine young\ndaredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these was the\ngovernor\'s wife herself, who welcomed Rostov as a near relative and\ncalled him \"Nicholas.\"\n\nCatherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise, and\ndancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the\nprovincial society by his agility. His particularly free manner of\ndancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised\nat the way he danced that evening. He had never danced like that in\nMoscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner\nimproper and in bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to\nastonish them all by something unusual, something they would have to\naccept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the\nprovinces.\n\nAll the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and\npleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.\nWith the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other\nmen\'s wives were created for them, Rostov did not leave the lady\'s\nside and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style,\nas if, without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and\nthe lady would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem\nto share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov. But\nthe latter\'s good-natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even\nhe involuntarily yielded to Nicholas\' good humor. Toward the end of\nthe evening, however, as the wife\'s face grew more flushed and\nanimated, the husband\'s became more and more melancholy and solemn, as\nthough there were but a given amount of animation between them and\nas the wife\'s share increased the husband\'s diminished.');

Her eyes\" (Nicholas looked at his\npartner) \"are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure\" (he glanced\nat her shoulders) \"like Diana\'s....\"\n\nThe husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking\nabout.\n\n\"Ah, Nikita Ivanych!\" cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if\nwishing Nikita Ivanych to share his joke, he began to tell him of\nhis intention to elope with a blonde lady.\n\nThe husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor\'s\ngood-natured wife came up with a look of disapproval.\n\n\"Anna Ignatyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,\" said she,\npronouncing the name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna\nIgnatyevna was a very important person. \"Come, Nicholas! You know\nyou let me call you so?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?\"\n\n\"Anna Ignatyevna Malvintseva. She has heard from her niece how you\nrescued her...

Please don\'t, Aunt!\"\n\n\"Very well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!\"\n\nThe governor\'s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady\nwith a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with\nthe most important personages of the town. This was Malvintseva,\nPrincess Mary\'s aunt on her mother\'s side, a rich, childless widow who\nalways lived in Voronezh. When Rostov approached her she was\nstanding settling up for the game. She looked at him and, screwing\nup her eyes sternly, continued to upbraid the general who had won from\nher.\n\n\"Very pleased, mon cher,\" she then said, holding out her hand to\nNicholas. \"Pray come and see me.\"\n\nAfter a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom\nMalvintseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas\nknew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the\nimportant old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation\nto come to see her.\n\nNicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the\nmention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and\neven of fear, which he himself did not understand.\n\nWhen he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the\ndancing, but the governor\'s little wife placed her plump hand on his\nsleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to\nher sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew\nso as not to be in her way.\n\n\"Do you know, dear boy,\" began the governor\'s wife with a serious\nexpression on her kind little face, \"that really would be the match\nfor you: would you like me to arrange it?\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean, Aunt?\" asked Nicholas.\n\n\"I will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petrovna\nspeaks of Lily, but I say, no--the princess! Do you want me to do\nit? I am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl\nshe is, really! And she is not at all so plain, either.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. \"As\nbefits a soldier, Aunt, I don\'t force myself on anyone or refuse\nanything,\" he said before he had time to consider what he was saying.\n\n\"Well then, remember, this is not a joke!\"\n\n\"Of course not!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the governor\'s wife said as if talking to herself. \"But,\nmy dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other,\nthe blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....\"\n\n\"Oh no, we are good friends with him,\" said Nicholas in the\nsimplicity of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so\npleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else.\n\n\"But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor\'s wife!\"\nthought Nicholas suddenly at supper. \"She will really begin to arrange\na match... and Sonya...?\" And on taking leave of the governor\'s\nwife, when she again smilingly said to him, \"Well then, remember!\"\nhe drew her aside.\n\n\"But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...\"\n\n\"What is it, my dear? Come, let\'s sit down here,\" said she.\n\nNicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate\nthoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or\nhis friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he\nafterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable\nfrankness which had very important results for him, it seemed to\nhim--as it seems to everyone in such cases--that it was merely some\nsilly whim that seized him: yet that burst of frankness, together with\nother trifling events, had immense consequences for him and for all\nhis family.\n\n\"You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but\nthe very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I understand,\" said the governor\'s wife.\n\n\"But Princess Bolkonskaya--that\'s another matter. I will tell you\nthe truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to\nher; and then, after I met her under such circumstances--so strangely,\nthe idea often occurred to me: \'This is fate.\' Especially if you\nremember that Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never\nhappened to meet her before, somehow it had always happened that we\ndid not meet. And as long as my sister Natasha was engaged to her\nbrother it was of course out of the question for me to think of\nmarrying her. And it must needs happen that I should meet her just\nwhen Natasha\'s engagement had been broken off... and then\neverything... So you see... I never told this to anyone and never\nwill, only to you.\"\n\nThe governor\'s wife pressed his elbow gratefully.\n\n\"You know Sonya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her,\nand will do so.... So you see there can be no question about-\" said\nNicholas incoherently and blushing.\n\n\"My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sonya has nothing\nand you yourself say your Papa\'s affairs are in a very bad way. And\nwhat about your mother? It would kill her, that\'s one thing. And\nwhat sort of life would it be for Sonya--if she\'s a girl with a heart?\nYour mother in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and\nSonya ought to understand that.\"\n\nNicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.\n\n\"All the same, Aunt, it is impossible,\" he rejoined with a sigh,\nafter a short pause. \"Besides, would the princess have me? And\nbesides, she is now in mourning. How can one think of it!\"\n\n\"But you don\'t suppose I\'m going to get you married at once? There\nis always a right way of doing things,\" replied the governor\'s wife.\n\n\"What a matchmaker you are, Aunt...\" said Nicholas, kissing her\nplump little hand.');

That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her\nduring her father\'s illness, since his death, and especially since her\nmeeting with Rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey,\nanxiety about her brother, settling in a new house, meeting new\npeople, and attending to her nephew\'s education. She was sad. Now,\nafter a month passed in quiet surroundings, she felt more and more\ndeeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with\nthe ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly tortured by the\nthought of the dangers to which her brother, the only intimate\nperson now remaining to her, was exposed. She was worried too about\nher nephew\'s education for which she had always felt herself\nincompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace--a\npeace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal\ndreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her\nand were related to her meeting with Rostov.\n\nThe day after her party the governor\'s wife came to see\nMalvintseva and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked\nthat though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of\ncourse, not to be thought of, all the same the young people might be\nbrought together and could get to know one another. Malvintseva\nexpressed approval, and the governor\'s wife began to speak of Rostov\nin Mary\'s presence, praising him and telling how he had blushed when\nPrincess Mary\'s name was mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a\npainful rather than a joyful feeling--her mental tranquillity was\ndestroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.\n\nDuring the two days that elapsed before Rostov called, Princess Mary\ncontinually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she\ndecided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her\naunt--that it would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to\nreceive visitors; then she thought this would be rude after what he\nhad done for her; then it occurred to her that her aunt and the\ngovernor\'s wife had intentions concerning herself and Rostov--their\nlooks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition--then\nshe told herself that only she, with her sinful nature, could think\nthis of them: they could not forget that situated as she was, while\nstill wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking would be an insult to\nher and to her father\'s memory. Assuming that she did go down to see\nhim, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she\nwould say to him, and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold\nand then to mean too much. More than anything she feared lest the\nconfusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she\nsaw him.\n\nBut when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing\nroom that Count Rostov had called, the princess showed no confusion,\nonly a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new\nand radiant light.\n\n\"You have met him, Aunt?\" said she in a calm voice, unable herself\nto understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.\n\nWhen Rostov entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an\ninstant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then\njust as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look\nwith shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she\nhalf rose with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate\nhand to him, and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time\nnew deep womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in\nthe drawing room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise.\nHerself a consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on\nmeeting a man she wished to attract.\n\n\"Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has\ngreatly improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what\ntact and grace!\" thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\nHad Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she\nwould have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the\nchange that had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized\nthat dear, loved face, a new life force took possession of her and\ncompelled her to speak and act apart from her own will. From the\ntime Rostov entered, her face became suddenly transformed. It was as\nif a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the\nintricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, that previously\nseemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly shown up in\nunexpected and striking beauty. For the first time all that pure,\nspiritual, inward travail through which she had lived appeared on\nthe surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction with herself,\nher sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her meekness, love,\nand self-sacrifice--all this now shone in those radiant eyes, in her\ndelicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.\n\nRostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He\nfelt that the being before him was quite different from, and better\nthan, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.\n\nTheir conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of\nthe war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow\nabout it; they spoke of their last meeting--Nicholas trying to\nchange the subject--they talked of the governor\'s kind wife, of\nNicholas\' relations, and of Princess Mary\'s.\n\nShe did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as\nsoon as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of\nRussia\'s misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was\ntoo near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of\nhim. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess\nMary\'s character with an observation unusual to him, and everything\nconfirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and\nextraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people\nspoke to him about the princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and\neven when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt quite at\nease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite\nappropriately, occurred to him at the moment.\n\nWhen a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is\nusual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew\'s little son,\ncaressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He\ntook the boy on his knee, played with him, and looked round at\nPrincess Mary. With a softened, happy, timid look she watched the\nboy she loved in the arms of the man she loved. Nicholas also\nnoticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed with pleasure\nand began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness.\n\nAs she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society,\nand Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but\nall the same the governor\'s wife went on with her matchmaking, passing\non to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and\nvice versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary.\nFor this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at\nthe bishop\'s house before Mass.\n\nThough Rostov told the governor\'s wife that he would not make any\ndeclaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.\n\nAs at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what\neverybody considered right was right, so now, after a short but\nsincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own\nsense of justice, and in obedient submission to circumstances, he\nchose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly\ncarrying him he knew not where. He knew that after his promise to\nSonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to\nPrincess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely. But he also\nknew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that by resigning\nhimself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were\nguiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing\nsomething very important--more important than anything he had ever\ndone in his life.\n\nAfter meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on\nexternally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for\nhim and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her\nas he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he\nhad met in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time\nrapturously, thought about Sonya. He had pictured each of those\nyoung ladies as almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as\na possible wife, adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions\nof married life: a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his\nwife\'s carriage, little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to\nher, and so on--and these pictures of the future had given him\npleasure. But with Princess Mary, to whom they were trying to get\nhim engaged, he could never picture anything of future married life.\nIf he tried, his pictures seemed incongruous and false. It made him\nafraid.');

Princess Mary, having\nlearned of her brother\'s wound only from the Gazette and having no\ndefinite news of him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her\nagain himself) to set off in search of Prince Andrew.\n\nWhen he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the\nabandonment of Moscow, Rostov was not seized with despair, anger,\nthe desire for vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but\neverything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and\nhe experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The\nconversations he heard seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to\njudge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would\neverything again become clear to him. He made haste to finish buying\nthe horses, and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and\nsquadron quartermaster.\n\nA few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which\nNicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian\nvictory. He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with\nmilitary decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of\nsubjects. When the service was over the governor\'s wife beckoned him\nto her.\n\n\"Have you seen the princess?\" she asked, indicating with a\nmovement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond\nthe choir.\n\nNicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the\nprofile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude,\ntimidity, and pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary,\nevidently engrossed by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last\ntime before leaving the church.\n\nNicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he\nhad seen before, there was the same general expression of refined,\ninner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There\nwas a pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had\noccurred before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her\nwithout waiting to be prompted by the governor\'s wife and not asking\nhimself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here\nin church, and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized\nwith his whole soul. As soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow\nkindled in her face, lighting up both her sorrow and her joy.\n\n\"There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,\" said Rostov.\n\"It is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikolievich, were not\nliving, it would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he\nis a colonel.\"\n\nThe princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but\ncheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.\n\n\"And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound\" (the Gazette\nsaid it was a shell) \"either proving fatal at once or being very\nslight,\" continued Nicholas. \"We must hope for the best, and I am\nsure...\"\n\nPrincess Mary interrupted him.\n\n\"Oh, that would be so dread...\" she began and, prevented by\nagitation from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as\ngraceful as everything she did in his presence and, looking up at\nhim gratefully, went out, following her aunt.\n\nThat evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle\nsome accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that\nbusiness it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to\ngo to bed, and for a long time he paced up and down the room,\nreflecting on his life, a thing he rarely did.\n\nPrincess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had\nmet her in Smolensk province. His having encountered her in such\nexceptional circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned\nher to him as a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her.\nWhen he met her again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was\nnot merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the\npeculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was,\nhowever, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to\nregret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her.\nBut that day\'s encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than\nwas desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face,\nthat radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially\nthe deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated\nhim and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostov could not bear to see the\nexpression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like\nPrince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy\nand dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed\nthe depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an\nirresistible attraction.\n\n\"She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!\" he said to himself.\n\"Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya?\" And he\ninvoluntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one\nand the abundance of it in the other--a spirituality he himself lacked\nand therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would\nhappen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would\nbecome his wife. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed,\nand no clear picture presented itself to his mind. He had long ago\npictured to himself a future with Sonya, and that was all clear and\nsimple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all\nthere was in Sonya, but it was impossible to picture a future with\nPrincess Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.\n\nReveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them,\nbut to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little\nfrightening.\n\n\"How she prayed!\" he thought. \"It was plain that her whole soul\nwas in her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains,\nand I am sure her prayer will be answered. Why don\'t I pray for what I\nwant?\" he suddenly thought. \"What do I want? To be free, released from\nSonya... She was right,\" he thought, remembering what the governor\'s\nwife had said: \"Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya.\nMuddles, grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible\nmuddles! Besides, I don\'t love her--not as I should. O, God! release\nme from this dreadful, inextricable position!\" he suddenly began to\npray. \"Yes, prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not\npray as Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn\ninto sugar--and then run out into the yard to see whether it had\ndone so. No, but I am not praying for trifles now,\" he thought as he\nput his pipe down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself\nbefore the icon. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to\npray as he had not done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in\nhis throat when the door opened and Lavrushka came in with some\npapers.\n\n\"Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?\" cried\nNicholas, quickly changing his attitude.\n\n\"From the governor,\" said Lavrushka in a sleepy voice. \"A courier\nhas arrived and there\'s a letter for you.\"\n\n\"Well, all right, thanks. You can go!\"\n\nNicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother\nand the other from Sonya. He recognized them by the handwriting and\nopened Sonya\'s first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale\nand his eyes opened wide with fear and joy.\n\n\"No, it\'s not possible!\" he cried aloud.\n\nUnable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter\nand reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then\nagain, and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his\nshoulders, stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and\nhis eyes fixed. What he had just been praying for with confidence that\nGod would hear him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much\nastonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected, and\nas if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had\nnot come from God to whom he had prayed, but by some ordinary\ncoincidence.\n\nThis unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary\nletter from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from\nwhich there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last\nunfortunate events--the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs\'\nMoscow property--and the countess\' repeatedly expressed wish that\nNicholas should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his\nsilence and coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide to\nrelease him from his promise and set him completely free.\n\n\nIt would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of\nsorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she\nwrote), and my love has no aim but the happiness of those I love;\nso, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured\nthat, in spite of everything, no one can love you more than does\n\nYour Sonya\n\n\nBoth letters were written from Troitsa. The other, from the\ncountess, described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the\nfire, and the destruction of all their property.

She knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle to this\nhappening, and Sonya\'s life in the countess\' house had grown harder\nand harder, especially after they had received a letter from\nNicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharovo. The\ncountess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions\nto Sonya.\n\nBut a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all\nthat was going on, she called Sonya to her and, instead of reproaching\nand making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself\nand repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her\nengagement with Nicholas.\n\n\"I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.\"\n\nSonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs\nthat she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave\nno actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was\ndemanded of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had\nreared and brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya\'s\nhabit. Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could\nshe show her worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it.\nBut in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily\nconscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of\nothers, and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more\nthan anything in the world. But now they wanted her to sacrifice the\nvery thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice\nand the whole meaning of her life. And for the first time she felt\nbitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to\ntorture her the more painfully; she felt jealous of Natasha who had\nnever experienced anything of this sort, had never needed to sacrifice\nherself, but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was\nbeloved by everybody. And for the first time Sonya felt that out of\nher pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning\nto grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue, or religion.\nUnder the influence of this feeling Sonya, whose life of dependence\nhad taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered the\ncountess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and resolved\nto wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but\non the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.\n\nThe bustle and terror of the Rostovs\' last days in Moscow stifled\nthe gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find\nescape from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince\nAndrew\'s presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and\nfor Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that\nGod did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that\nNatasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love\nhim. She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible\ncircumstances they would again fall in love with one another, and that\nNicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would\nbe within the prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror\nof what had happened during those last days and during the first\ndays of their journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in\nher personal affairs cheered Sonya.\n\nAt the Troitsa monastery the Rostovs first broke their journey for a\nwhole day.\n\nThree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry,\none of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much\nbetter that day and Natasha was sitting with him. In the next room sat\nthe count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was\ncalling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.\nSonya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew\nand Natasha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices\nthrough the door. That door opened and Natasha came out, looking\nexcited. Not noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was\ndrawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sonya\nand took her hand.\n\n\"Natasha, what are you about? Come here!\" said the countess.\n\nNatasha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to\npray for aid to God and His saint.\n\nAs soon as the prior withdrew, Natasha took her friend by the hand\nand went with her into the unoccupied room.\n\n\"Sonya, will he live?\" she asked. \"Sonya, how happy I am, and how\nunhappy!... Sonya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he\nlives! He cannot... because... because... of\" and Natasha burst into\ntears.\n\n\"Yes! I knew it! Thank God!\" murmured Sonya. \"He will live.\"\n\nSonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter\'s fear and\ngrief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.\nSobbing, she kissed and comforted Natasha. \"If only he lives!\" she\nthought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two\nfriends went together to Prince Andrew\'s door. Natasha opened it\ncautiously and glanced into the room, Sonya standing beside her at the\nhalf-open door.\n\nPrince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale\nface was calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular\nbreathing.\n\n\"O, Natasha!\" Sonya suddenly almost screamed, catching her\ncompanion\'s arm and stepping back from the door.\n\n\"What? What is it?\" asked Natasha.\n\n\"It\'s that, that...\" said Sonya, with a white face and trembling\nlips.\n\nNatasha softly closed the door and went with Sonya to the window,\nnot yet understanding what the latter was telling her.\n\n\"You remember,\" said Sonya with a solemn and frightened\nexpression. \"You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at\nOtradnoe at Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried Natasha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely\nrecalling that Sonya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom\nshe had seen lying down.\n\n\"You remember?\" Sonya went on. \"I saw it then and told everybody,\nyou and Dunyasha. I saw him lying on a bed,\" said she, making a\ngesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, \"and that he\nhad his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that\nhis hands were folded,\" she concluded, convincing herself that the\ndetails she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the\nmirror.\n\nShe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first\nthing that came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed\nto her now as real as any other recollection. She not only\nremembered what she had then said--that he turned to look at her and\nsmiled and was covered with something red--but was firmly convinced\nthat she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink\nquilt and that his eyes were closed.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it really was pink!\" cried Natasha, who now thought she\ntoo remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most\nextraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.\n\n\"But what does it mean?\" she added meditatively.\n\n\"Oh, I don\'t know, it is all so strange,\" replied Sonya, clutching\nat her head.\n\nA few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natasha went to him,\nbut Sonya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the\nwindow thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.\n\n\nThey had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and\nthe countess was writing to her son.\n\n\"Sonya!\" said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as\nher niece passed, \"Sonya, won\'t you write to Nicholas?\" She spoke in a\nsoft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her\nspectacles Sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these\nwords. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear\nof a refusal, and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such\nrefusal.\n\nSonya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.\n\n\"Yes, Mamma, I will write,\" said she.\n\nSonya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred\nthat day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen\nof her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha\'s\nrelations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying\nPrincess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a return of that\nself-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and\nloved to live. So with a joyful consciousness of performing a\nmagnanimous deed--interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed\nher velvety black eyes--she wrote that touching letter the arrival\nof which had so amazed Nicholas.');

In their attitude toward him could still be felt both\nuncertainty as to who he might be--perhaps a very important\nperson--and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict\nwith him.\n\nBut when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for\nthe new guard--both officers and men--he was not as interesting as\nhe had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day\ndid not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the\nvigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and\nthe convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child;\nthey saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and\ndetained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they\nnoticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed,\nmeditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke\nFrench, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he\nwas placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the\nseparate room he had occupied was required by an officer.\n\nAll the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class\nand, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more\nespecially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them\nmaking fun of him.\n\nThat evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably,\namong them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was\ntaken with the others to a house where a French general with a white\nmustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on\ntheir arms. With the precision and definiteness customary in\naddressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude human frailty,\nPierre like the others was questioned as to who he was, where he had\nbeen, with what object, and so on.\n\nThese questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the\nessence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that\nessence\'s being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel\nthrough which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow\nso as to lead to the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as\nPierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim, the\nchannel was removed and the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt,\nmoreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, perplexity as\nto why these questions were put to him. He had a feeling that it was\nonly out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of\nplacing a channel was employed. He knew he was in these men\'s power,\nthat only by force had they brought him there, that force alone gave\nthem the right to demand answers to their questions, and that the sole\nobject of that assembly was to inculpate him. And so, as they had\nthe power and wish to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry\nand trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would\nlead to conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was arrested,\nPierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to\nits parents a child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought\nthe marauder? Pierre answered that he \"was protecting a woman,\" and\nthat \"to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of\nevery man; that...\" They interrupted him, for this was not to the\npoint. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had\nseen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in\nMoscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked where he was\ngoing, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they asked,\nrepeating their first question, which he had declined to answer. Again\nhe replied that he could not answer it.\n\n\"Put that down, that\'s bad... very bad,\" sternly remarked the\ngeneral with the white mustache and red flushed face.\n\n\nOn the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski rampart.\n\nPierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a\nmerchant\'s house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the\nstreets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the\nwhole city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize\nthe significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires\nwith horror.\n\nHe passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and\nduring that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that\nall those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any\nday from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn\nfrom the soldiers. Evidently for them \"the marshal\" represented a very\nhigh and rather mysterious power.\n\nThese first days, before the eighth of September when the\nprisoners were had up for a second examination, were the hardest of\nall for Pierre.');

This officer, probably someone on\nthe staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the\nRussians there, naming Pierre as \"the man who does not give his name.\"\nGlancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered\nthe officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up\nbefore taking them to the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers\narrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin\'s Field.\nIt was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure.\nThe smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken\nfrom the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the pure\nair in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose on\nall sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast\ncharred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves\nand chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the blackened\nwalls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not\nrecognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see\nchurches that had not been burned. The Kremlin, which was not\ndestroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the\nbelfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin\nglittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.\nThese bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the\nNativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate\nthis holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to\nbe seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when\nthey saw the French.\n\nIt was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but\nin place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed,\nPierre unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order\nhad been established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the\nlooks of the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and\ngaily, were escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the\nlooks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by\na soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of\nregimental music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt\nand realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French\nofficer had read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been\ntaken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to\nanother place with dozens of other men, and it seemed that they\nmight have forgotten him, or confused him with the others. But no: the\nanswers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his\ndesignation as \"the man who does not give his name,\" and under that\nappellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were now leading\nhim somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and\nall the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that\nthey were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be\nan insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose\naction he did not understand but which was working well.\n\nHe and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the\nVirgin\'s Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not\nfar from the convent. This was Prince Shcherbitov\'s house, where\nPierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned from the\ntalk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of\nEckmuhl (Davout).\n\nThey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.\nPierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass\ngallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a\nlong low study at the door of which stood an adjutant.\n\nDavout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end\nof the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently\nconsulting a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without\nraising his eyes, he said in a low voice:\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nPierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To\nhim Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for\nhis cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern\nschoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre\nfelt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did\nnot know what to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at\nhis first examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was\ndangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had\ndecided what to do, Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back\non his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.\n\n\"I know that man,\" he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently\ncalculated to frighten Pierre.\n\nThe chill that had been running down Pierre\'s back now seized his\nhead as in a vise.\n\n\"You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...\"\n\n\"He is a Russian spy,\" Davout interrupted, addressing another\ngeneral who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.\n\nDavout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice\nPierre rapidly began:\n\n\"No, monseigneur,\" he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a\nduke. \"No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia\nofficer and have not quitted Moscow.\"\n\n\"Your name?\" asked Davout.\n\n\"Bezukhov.\"\n\n\"What proof have I that you are not lying?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a\npleading voice.\n\nDavout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they\nlooked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from\nconditions of war and law, that look established human relations\nbetween the two men. At that moment an immense number of things passed\ndimly through both their minds, and they realized that they were\nboth children of humanity and were brothers.\n\nAt the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the\npapers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre\nwas merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without\nburdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a\nhuman being. He reflected for a moment.\n\n\"How can you show me that you are telling the truth?\" said Davout\ncoldly.\n\nPierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the\nstreet where the house was.\n\n\"You are not what you say,\" returned Davout.\n\nIn a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of\nthe truth of his statements.\n\nBut at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to\nDavout.\n\nDavout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began\nbuttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten\nPierre.\n\nWhen the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head\nin Pierre\'s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But\nwhere they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach\nhouse or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to\nhim as they crossed the Virgin\'s Field.\n\nHe turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another\nquestion to Davout.\n\n\"Yes, of course!\" replied Davout, but what this \"yes\" meant,\nPierre did not know.\n\nPierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was\nfar, or in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was\nstupefied, and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs\nas the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only\nthought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had really\nsentenced him to death? Not the men on the commission that had first\nexamined him--not one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done\nit. It was not Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In\nanother moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong, but\njust then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. The\nadjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might\nhave refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing\nhim, depriving him of life--him, Pierre, with all his memories,\naspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre\nfelt that it was no one.\n\nIt was a system--a concurrence of circumstances.\n\nA system of some sort was killing him--Pierre--depriving him of\nlife, of everything, annihilating him.');

Beyond that post a fresh pit\nhad been dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large\ncrowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and\nmany of Napoleon\'s soldiers who were not on duty--Germans, Italians,\nand Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of\nthe post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red\nepaulets and high boots and shakos.\n\nThe prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the\nlist (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums\nsuddenly began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre\nfelt as if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of\nthinking or understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only\none wish--that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen\nquickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized\nthem.\n\nThe two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and\nthin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The\nthird was a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled\nhair and a plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a\nvery handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes.\nThe fifth was a factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen\nin a loose coat.\n\nPierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them\nseparately or two at a time. \"In couples,\" replied the officer in\ncommand in a calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers\nand it was evident that they were all hurrying--not as men hurry to do\nsomething they understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary\nbut unpleasant and incomprehensible task.\n\nA French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of\nprisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.\n\nThen two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the\nofficer\'s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row.\nThe convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks\nwere being brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at\nan approaching huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other\nscratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile.\nWith hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks\nover their heads, and bound them to the post.\n\nTwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a\nfirm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned\naway to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling,\nrolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most\nterrific thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the\nFrenchmen were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and\ntrembling hands. Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and\nwith similar looks, these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with\nonly a silent appeal for protection in their eyes, evidently unable to\nunderstand or believe what was going to happen to them. They could not\nbelieve it because they alone knew what their life meant to them,\nand so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken\nfrom them.\n\nAgain Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again\nthe sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the\nsame moment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the\nFrenchmen who were again doing something by the post, their\ntrembling hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily,\nlooked around as if asking what it meant. The same question was\nexpressed in all the looks that met his.\n\nOn the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and\nofficers without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and\nconflict that were in his own heart. \"But who, after all, is doing\nthis? They are all suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?\" flashed\nfor an instant through his mind.\n\n\"Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!\" shouted someone. The fifth\nprisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away--alone. Pierre did\nnot understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been\nbrought there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror,\nand no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place.\nThe fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment\nthey laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at\nPierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook himself free.) The lad was\nunable to walk. They dragged him along, holding him up under the arms,\nand he screamed. When they got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he\nsuddenly understood something. Whether he understood that screaming\nwas useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill\nhim, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be\nblindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around\nhim with glittering eyes.\n\nPierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His\ncuriosity and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the\nhighest pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man\nseemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare\nfoot with the other.\n\nWhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot\nwhich hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against\nthe bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in\nthat position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned\nback again more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and\ndid not miss his slightest movement.\n\nProbably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports\nof eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards\nremember having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw\nhow the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how\nblood showed itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the\nweight of the hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head\nhanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the\npost. No one hindered him. Pale, frightened people were doing\nsomething around the workman. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a\nthick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The body collapsed.\nThe soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it\ninto the pit.\n\nThey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who\nmust hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.\n\nPierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying\nwith his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the\nother. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively,\nbut spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole\nbody. One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and\nangrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand him and\nremained near the post, and no one drove him away.\n\nWhen the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was\ntaken back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the\npost made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The\ntwenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the\ncenter of the circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed\nby.\n\nPierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in\ncouples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies.\nThis one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed\nback, and his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit\nat the spot from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man,\ntaking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling. An\nold, noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by\nthe elbow dragged him to his company. The crowd of Russians and\nFrenchmen began to disperse. They all went away silently and with\ndrooping heads.\n\n\"That will teach them to start fires,\" said one of the Frenchmen.\n\nPierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier\nwho was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was\nnot able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he\nmade a hopeless movement with his arm and went away.');

Without understanding what was said\nto him, Pierre got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the\nupper end of the field, where there were some sheds built of charred\nplanks, beams, and battens, and led him into one of them. In the\ndarkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at\nthem without understanding who they were, why they were there, or what\nthey wanted of him. He heard what they said, but did not understand\nthe meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or\napplication of them. He replied to questions they put to him, but\ndid not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they\nwould understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but\nthey all seemed to him equally meaningless.\n\nFrom the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders\ncommitted by men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the\nmainspring of his life, on which everything depended and which made\neverything appear alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything\nhad collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not\nacknowledge it to himself, his faith in the right ordering of the\nuniverse, in humanity, in his own soul, and in God, had been\ndestroyed. He had experienced this before, but never so strongly as\nnow. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had been the\nresult of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he had\nfelt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be\nfound within himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled\nbefore his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by\nany fault of his own. He felt that it was not in his power to regain\nfaith in the meaning of life.\n\nAround him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something\nabout him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and\nasking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he\nfound himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing\nand talking on all sides.\n\n\"Well, then, mates... that very prince who...\" some voice at the\nother end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word\nwho.\n\nSitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,\nPierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon\nas he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory\nlad--especially dreadful because of its simplicity--and the faces of\nthe murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he\nopened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around\nhim.\n\nBeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose\npresence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration\nwhich came from him every time he moved. This man was doing\nsomething to his legs in the darkness, and though Pierre could not see\nhis face he felt that the man continually glanced at him. On growing\nused to the darkness Pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg\nbands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre\'s interest.\n\nHaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he\ncarefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg,\nglancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the\nother was already unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way,\nhaving carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his\narm following one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg\nbands up on some pegs fixed above his head. Then he took out a\nknife, cut something, closed the knife, placed it under the head of\nhis bed, and, seating himself comfortably, clasped his arms round\nhis lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was\nconscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well rounded in these\ndeft movements, in the man\'s well-ordered arrangements in his\ncorner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without\ntaking his eyes from him.\n\n\"You\'ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?\" the little man suddenly\nsaid.\n\nAnd there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong\nvoice that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt\ntears rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time\nto betray his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant\ntones:\n\n\"Eh, lad, don\'t fret!\" said he, in the tender singsong caressing\nvoice old Russian peasant women employ. \"Don\'t fret, friend--\'suffer\nan hour, live for an age!\' that\'s how it is, my dear fellow. And\nhere we live, thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too,\nthere are good men as well as bad,\" said he, and still speaking, he\nturned on his knees with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and\nwent off to another part of the shed.\n\n\"Eh, you rascal!\" Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the\nother end of the shed. \"So you\'ve come, you rascal? She remembers...\nNow, now, that\'ll do!\"\n\nAnd the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at\nhim, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something\nwrapped in a rag.\n\n\"Here, eat a bit, sir,\" said he, resuming his former respectful tone\nas he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. \"We had soup\nfor dinner and the potatoes are grand!\"\n\nPierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed\nextremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.\n\n\"Well, are they all right?\" said the soldier with a smile. \"You\nshould do like this.\"\n\nHe took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into\ntwo equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it\nfrom the rag, and handed it to Pierre.\n\n\"The potatoes are grand!\" he said once more. \"Eat some like that!\"\n\nPierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.\n\n\"Oh, I\'m all right,\" said he, \"but why did they shoot those poor\nfellows? The last one was hardly twenty.\"\n\n\"Tss, tt...!\" said the little man. \"Ah, what a sin... what a sin!\"\nhe added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his\nmouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: \"How was it, sir, that\nyou stayed in Moscow?\"\n\n\"I didn\'t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,\"\nreplied Pierre.\n\n\"And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?\"\n\n\"No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and\ntried me as an incendiary.\"\n\n\"Where there\'s law there\'s injustice,\" put in the little man.\n\n\"And have you been here long?\" Pierre asked as he munched the last\nof the potato.\n\n\"I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.\"\n\n\"Why, are you a soldier then?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment. I was dying of\nfever. We weren\'t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying\nthere. We had no idea, never guessed at all.\"\n\n\"And do you feel sad here?\" Pierre inquired.\n\n\"How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the surname is\nKarataev,\" he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to\naddress him. \"They call me \'little falcon\' in the regiment. How is one\nto help feeling sad? Moscow--she\'s the mother of cities. How can one\nsee all this and not feel sad? But \'the maggot gnaws the cabbage,\nyet dies first\'; that\'s what the old folks used to tell us,\" he\nadded rapidly.\n\n\"What? What did you say?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Who? I?\" said Karataev. \"I say things happen not as we plan but\nas God judges,\" he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had\nsaid before, and immediately continued:\n\n\"Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you\nhave abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are\nthey still living?\" he asked.\n\nAnd though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a\nsuppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier\'s lips as he put\nthese questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents,\nespecially that he had no mother.\n\n\"A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there\'s none\nas dear as one\'s own mother!\" said he. \"Well, and have you little\nones?\" he went on asking.\n\nAgain Pierre\'s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he\nhastened to add:\n\n\"Never mind! You\'re young folks yet, and please God may still have\nsome. The great thing is to live in harmony....\"\n\n\"But it\'s all the same now,\" Pierre could not help saying.\n\n\"Ah, my dear fellow!\" rejoined Karataev, \"never decline a prison\nor a beggar\'s sack!\"\n\nHe seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently\npreparing to tell a long story.\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,\" he began. \"We\nhad a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and\nour house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing\nthere were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so\nhappened...\"\n\nAnd Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into\nsomeone\'s copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper,\nhad been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.\n\n\"Well, lad,\" and a smile changed the tone of his voice \"we thought\nit was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been\nfor my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my\nyounger brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a\nwife behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a\nsoldier. I come home on leave and I\'ll tell you how it was, I look and\nsee that they are living better than before. The yard full of\ncattle, the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only\nMichael the youngest, at home. Father, he says, \'All my children are\nthe same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if\nPlaton hadn\'t been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to\ngo.\' called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front\nof the icons. \'Michael,\' he says, \'come here and bow down to his feet;\nand you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also\nbow down before him! Do you understand?\' he says. That\'s how it is,\ndear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always judging, \'that\'s\nnot well--that\'s not right!\' Our luck is like water in a dragnet:\nyou pull at it and it bulges, but when you\'ve drawn it out it\'s empty!\nThat\'s how it is.\"\n\nAnd Platon shifted his seat on the straw.\n\nAfter a short silence he rose.\n\n\"Well, I think you must be sleepy,\" said he, and began rapidly\ncrossing himself and repeating:\n\n\"Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus\nChrist, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ,\nhave mercy on us and save us!\" he concluded, then bowed to the ground,\ngot up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. \"That\'s the\nway. Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,\" he\nmuttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.\n\n\"What prayer was that you were saying?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"Eh?\" murmured Platon, who had almost fallen asleep. \"What was I\nsaying? I was praying. Don\'t you pray?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Pierre. \"But what was that you said: Frola and\nLavra?\"\n\n\"Well, of course,\" replied Platon quickly, \"the horses\' saints.\nOne must pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you\'ve curled up\nand got warm, you daughter of a bitch!\" said Karataev, touching the\ndog that lay at his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep\nimmediately.\n\nSounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance\noutside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but\ninside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep,\nbut lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular\nsnoring of Platon who lay beside him, and he felt that the world\nthat had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a\nnew beauty and on new and unshakable foundations.');

When Pierre saw his neighbor next\nmorning at dawn the first impression of him, as of something round,\nwas fully confirmed: Platon\'s whole figure--in a French overcoat\ngirdled with a cord, a soldier\'s cap, and bast shoes--was round. His\nhead was quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms,\nwhich he held as if ever ready to embrace something, were rounded, his\npleasant smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were also round.\n\nPlaton Karataev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of\ncampaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not\nhimself know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his\nbrilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken\nsemicircles when he laughed--as he often did--were all sound and good,\nthere was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole\nbody gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and\nendurance.\n\nHis face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of\ninnocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief\npeculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It\nwas evident that he never considered what he had said or was going\nto say, and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation\nhad an irresistible persuasiveness.\n\nHis physical strength and agility during the first days of his\nimprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and\nsickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: \"Lord, lay\nme down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!\" and every morning on\ngetting up, he said: \"I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake\nmyself.\" And indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a\nstone, and he only had to shake himself, to be ready without a\nmoment\'s delay for some work, just as children are ready to play\ndirectly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not\nbadly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was\nalways busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation--of\nwhich he was fond--and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer\nwho knows he is listened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent\nto the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks\nabout to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were always\nhigh-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his face at\nsuch times was very serious.\n\nHaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to\nhave thrown off all that had been forced upon him--everything military\nand alien to himself--and had returned to his former peasant habits.\n\n\"A soldier on leave--a shirt outside breeches,\" he would say.\n\nHe did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did\nnot complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once\nduring the whole of his army service. When he related anything it\nwas generally some old and evidently precious memory of his\n\"Christian\" life, as he called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of\nwhich his talk was full, were for the most part not the coarse and\nindecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings which taken\nwithout a context seem so insignificant, but when used appositely\nsuddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom.\n\nHe would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a\nprevious occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he\ntalked well, adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with\nfolk sayings which Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief\ncharm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events--sometimes\njust such as Pierre had witnessed without taking notice of\nthem--assumed in Karataev\'s a character of solemn fitness. He liked to\nhear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening\n(they were always the same), but most of all he liked to hear stories\nof real life. He would smile joyfully when listening to such stories,\nnow and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral\nbeauty of what he was told clear to himself. Karataev had no\nattachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre understood them, but\nloved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in\ncontact with, particularly with man--not any particular man, but those\nwith whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the\nFrench, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite\nof Karataev\'s affectionate tenderness for him (by which he\nunconsciously gave Pierre\'s spiritual life its due) he would not have\ngrieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in\nthe same way toward Karataev.\n\nTo all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a most ordinary\nsoldier. They called him \"little falcon\" or \"Platosha,\" chaffed him\ngood-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always\nremained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable,\nrounded, eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and\ntruth.\n\nPlaton Karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he\nbegan to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.\n\nSometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask\nhim to repeat them, but Platon could never recall what he had said a\nmoment before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of\nhis favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred\nin it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of\nit. He did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart\nfrom their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation\nof an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he\nregarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only\nas part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and\nactions flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as\nfragrance exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value\nor significance of any word or deed taken separately.');

Whether it were difficult or easy,\npossible or impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it\nwas her duty not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps\ndying, but to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so\nshe prepared to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew\nhimself, Princess Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to\nhis considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her\nand his son.\n\nIn a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were\nthe huge family coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, a\nsemiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle\nBourienne, little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three\nmaids, Tikhon, and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to\naccompany her.\n\nThe usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the\nroundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk,\nRyazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long and, as post horses were not\neverywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan where the\nFrench were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.\n\nDuring this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and\nPrincess Mary\'s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of\nspirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and\nno difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy,\nwhich infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslavl by\nthe end of the second week.\n\nThe last days of her stay in Voronezh had been the happiest of her\nlife. Her love for Rostov no longer tormented or agitated her. It\nfilled her whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she\nno longer struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that\nshe loved and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to\nherself in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview\nwith Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was\nwith the Rostovs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the\nfact that Prince Andrew\'s relations with Natasha might, if he\nrecovered, be renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he\nknew and thought of this.\n\nYet in spite of that, his relation to her--considerate, delicate,\nand loving--not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to\nPrincess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between\nthem allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew\nthat she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that\nshe was beloved, and was happy in regard to it.\n\nBut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not\nprevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the\ncontrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the\nmore possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her\nbrother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving\nVoronezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn,\ndespairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But\nthe very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she\ntook so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and\ngave her strength.\n\nAs always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of\nthe journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached\nYaroslavl the thought of what might await her there--not after many\ndays, but that very evening--again presented itself to her and her\nagitation increased to its utmost limit.\n\nThe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the\nRostovs were staying in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince Andrew\nwas, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was\nappalled by the terrible pallor of the princess\' face that looked\nout at him from the window.\n\n\"I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostovs are\nstaying at the merchant Bronnikov\'s house, in the Square not far\nfrom here, right above the Volga,\" said the courier.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not\nunderstanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know:\nhow was her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.\n\n\"How is the prince?\" she asked.\n\n\"His excellency is staying in the same house with them.\"\n\n\"Then he is alive,\" thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:\n\"How is he?\"\n\n\"The servants say he is still the same.\"\n\nWhat \"still the same\" might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with\nan unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting\nin front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her\nhead and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling,\nshaking and swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as\nthey were let down.\n\nThe carriage door was opened. On the left there was water--a great\nriver--and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:\nservants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as\nit seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This\nwas Sonya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. \"This way, this way!\" said\nthe girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found\nherself in the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came\nrapidly to meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She\nembraced Princess Mary and kissed her.\n\n\"Mon enfant!\" she muttered, \"je vous aime et vous connais depuis\nlongtemps.\"*\n\n\n*\"My child! I love you and have known you a long time.\"\n\n\n Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the\ncountess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly\nknowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in\nFrench in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and\nasked: \"How is he?\"\n\n\"The doctor says that he is not in danger,\" said the countess, but\nas she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed\na contradiction of her words.\n\n\"Where is he? Can I see him--can I?\" asked the princess.\n\n\"One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?\" said\nthe countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with\nDessalles. \"There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh,\nwhat a lovely boy!\"\n\nThe countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sonya\nwas talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the\nboy, and the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had\nchanged very much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had\nbeen a brisk, cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful,\nbewildered person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually\nlooked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right\nthing. After the destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out\nof his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own\nsignificance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in\nlife.\n\nIn spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible,\nand her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him\nthey should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her\nnephew, the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt\nthe necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things\nwhich she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it\nwas hard for her she was not vexed with these people.\n\n\"This is my niece,\" said the count, introducing Sonya--\"You don\'t\nknow her, Princess?\"\n\nPrincess Mary turned to Sonya and, trying to stifle the hostile\nfeeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she\nfelt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so\nfar from what was in her own heart.\n\n\"Where is he?\" she asked again, addressing them all.\n\n\"He is downstairs. Natasha is with him,\" answered Sonya, flushing.\n\"We have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.\"\n\nTears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary\'s eyes. She\nturned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to\nhim, when light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard\nat the door. The princess looked round and saw Natasha coming in,\nalmost running--that Natasha whom she had liked so little at their\nmeeting in Moscow long since.\n\nBut hardly had the princess looked at Natasha\'s face before she\nrealized that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a\nfriend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her\nshoulder.\n\nAs soon as Natasha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew\'s bed,\nheard of Princess Mary\'s arrival, she softly left his room and\nhastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to\nPrincess Mary.\n\nThere was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into\nthe drawing room--that of love--boundless love for him, for her, and\nfor all that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for\nothers, and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping\nthem. It was plain that at that moment there was in Natasha\'s heart no\nthought of herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.\n\nPrincess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at\nthe first glance at Natasha\'s face, and wept on her shoulder with\nsorrowful pleasure.\n\n\"Come, come to him, Mary,\" said Natasha, leading her into the\nother room.\n\nPrincess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to\nNatasha. She felt that from her she would be able to understand and\nlearn everything.\n\n\"How...\" she began her question but stopped short.\n\nShe felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.\nNatasha\'s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly\nand profoundly.\n\nNatasha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to\nsay all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous\neyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was\nimpossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly,\nNatasha\'s lips twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and\ncovering her face with her hands she burst into sobs.\n\nPrincess Mary understood.\n\nBut she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:\n\n\"But how is his wound? What is his general condition?\"\n\n\"You, you... will see,\" was all Natasha could say.\n\nThey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had\nleft off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.\n\n\"How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse?\nWhen did this happen?\" Princess Mary inquired.\n\nNatasha told her that at first there had been danger from his\nfeverish condition and the pain he suffered, but at Troitsa that had\npassed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger\nhad also passed. When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to\nfester (Natasha knew all about such things as festering) and the\ndoctor had said that the festering might take a normal course. Then\nfever set in, but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.\n\n\"But two days ago this suddenly happened,\" said Natasha,\nstruggling with her sobs. \"I don\'t know why, but you will see what\nhe is like.\"\n\n\"Is he weaker? Thinner?\" asked the princess.\n\n\"No, it\'s not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too\ngood, he cannot, cannot live, because...\"');

As she stepped to the door she\nalready saw in imagination Andrew\'s face as she remembered it in\nchildhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown,\nand which therefore affected her very strongly. She was sure he\nwould speak soft, tender words to her such as her father had uttered\nbefore his death, and that she would not be able to bear it and\nwould burst into sobs in his presence. Yet sooner or later it had to\nbe, and she went in. The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat\nas she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her\nshortsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and then she saw his\nface and met his gaze.\n\nHe was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan,\nsurrounded by pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin,\ntranslucently white hand he held a handkerchief, while with the\nother he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown, moving his\nfingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they entered.\n\nOn seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary\'s pace\nsuddenly slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She\nsuddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of\nhis face and eyes.\n\n\"But in what am I to blame?\" she asked herself. And his cold,\nstern look replied: \"Because you are alive and thinking of the living,\nwhile I...\"\n\nIn the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but\ninwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded\nhis sister and Natasha.\n\nHe kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.\n\n\"How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?\" said he in a\nvoice as calm and aloof as his look.\n\nHad he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such\nhorror into Princess Mary\'s heart as the tone of his voice.\n\n\"And have you brought little Nicholas?\" he asked in the same slow,\nquiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember.\n\n\"How are you now?\" said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she\nwas saying.\n\n\"That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,\" he replied, and again\nmaking an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips\nonly (his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):\n\n\"Merci, chere amie, d\'etre venue.\"*\n\n\n*\"Thank you for coming, my dear.\"\n\n\nPrincess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just\nperceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She\nnow understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words,\nhis tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look\ncould be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world,\nterrible in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he\nunderstand anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to\nunderstand, not because he lacked the power to do so but because he\nunderstood something else--something the living did not and could\nnot understand--and which wholly occupied his mind.\n\n\"There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,\" said\nhe, breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha. \"She looks after\nme all the time.\"\n\nPrincess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such\na thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say\nthat, before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to\nlive he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone.\nIf he had not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to\npity her and how could he speak like that in her presence? The only\nexplanation was that he was indifferent, because something else,\nmuch more important, had been revealed to him.\n\nThe conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke\noff.\n\n\"Mary came by way of Ryazan,\" said Natasha.\n\nPrince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and\nonly after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it\nherself.\n\n\"Really?\" he asked.\n\n\"They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...\"\n\nNatasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was\nmaking an effort to listen, but could not do so.\n\n\"Yes, they say it\'s burned,\" he said. \"It\'s a great pity,\" and he\ngazed straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his\nfingers.\n\n\"And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?\" Prince Andrew suddenly\nsaid, evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. \"He wrote here\nthat he took a great liking to you,\" he went on simply and calmly,\nevidently unable to understand all the complex significance his\nwords had for living people. \"If you liked him too, it would be a good\nthing for you to get married,\" he added rather more quickly, as if\npleased at having found words he had long been seeking.\n\nPrincess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her,\nexcept as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.\n\n\"Why talk of me?\" she said quietly and glanced at Natasha.\n\nNatasha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were\nagain silent.\n\n\"Andrew, would you like...\" Princess Mary suddenly said in a\ntrembling voice, \"would you like to see little Nicholas? He is\nalways talking about you!\"\n\nPrince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but\nPrincess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he\ndid not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with\nquiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she\nbelieved to be the last means of arousing him.\n\n\"Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?\"\n\nWhen little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew\'s room he looked\nat his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one\nelse was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know\nwhat to say to him.\n\nWhen Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to\nher brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer\nbegan to cry.\n\nHe looked at her attentively.\n\n\"Is it about Nicholas?\" he asked.\n\nPrincess Mary nodded her head, weeping.\n\n\"Mary, you know the Gosp...\" but he broke off.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Nothing. You mustn\'t cry here,\" he said, looking at her with the\nsame cold expression.\n\n\nWhen Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying\nat the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father.\nWith a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things\nfrom their point of view.\n\n\"Yes, to them it must seem sad!\" he thought. \"But how simple it is.\n\n\"The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father\nfeedeth them,\" he said to himself and wished to say to Princess\nMary; \"but no, they will take it their own way, they won\'t understand!\nThey can\'t understand that all those feelings they prize so--all our\nfeelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are\nunnecessary. We cannot understand one another,\" and he remained\nsilent.\n\n\nPrince Andrew\'s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and\nknew nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining\nknowledge, observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the\nfaculties he afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or\nmore profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had\nwitnessed between his father, Mary, and Natasha, than he had then.\nHe understood it completely, and, leaving the room without crying,\nwent silently up to Natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly\nat her with his beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy\nupper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry.\n\nAfter that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him\nand either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Natasha\nof whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them\nquietly and shyly.\n\nWhen Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood\nwhat Natasha\'s face had told her. She did not speak any more to\nNatasha of hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside\nhis sofa, and did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in\nsoul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the\ndying man was now so evident.');

He was conscious of an\naloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness\nof existence. Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming.\nThat inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which\nhe had felt continually all his life--was now near to him and, by\nthe strange lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and\npalpable...\n\n\nFormerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that\nterribly tormenting fear of death--the end--but now he no longer\nunderstood that fear.\n\n He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top\nbefore him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the\nsky, and knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to\nhimself after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love\nhad instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage\nof life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased\nto think about it.\n\nDuring the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he\nspent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new\nprinciple of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously\ndetached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody\nand always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not\nto live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that\nprinciple of love, the more he renounced life and the more\ncompletely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which--in the absence of\nsuch love--stands between life and death. When during those first days\nhe remembered that he would have to die, he said to himself: \"Well,\nwhat of it? So much the better!\"\n\nBut after the night in Mytishchi when, half delirious, he had seen\nher for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her\nhand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a\nparticular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more\nbound him to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy\nhis mind. Recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had\nseen Kuragin, he could not now regain the feeling he then had, but was\ntormented by the question whether Kuragin was alive. And he dared\nnot inquire.\n\nHis illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natasha\nreferred to when she said: \"This suddenly happened,\" had occurred\ntwo days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual\nstruggle between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It\nwas the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life\nas presented to him in the form of his love for Natasha, and a last,\nthough ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.\n\nIt was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish,\nand his thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sonya was sitting by\nthe table. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized\nhim.\n\n\"Ah, she has come!\" thought he.\n\nAnd so it was: in Sonya\'s place sat Natasha who had just come in\nnoiselessly.\n\nSince she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced\nthis physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an\narmchair placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from\nhim, and was knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings\nsince Prince Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick\nso well as old nurses who knit stockings, and that there is\nsomething soothing in the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked\nlightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see\nthe thoughtful profile of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball\nrolled off her knees. She started, glanced round at him, and screening\nthe candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact\nmovement, picked up the ball, and regained her former position.\n\nHe looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a\ndeep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed\ncautiously.\n\nAt the Troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had\ntold her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound\nwhich had brought them together again, but after that they never spoke\nof the future.\n\n\"Can it or can it not be?\" he now thought as he looked at her and\nlistened to the light click of the steel needles. \"Can fate have\nbrought me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible\nthat the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that\nI have spent my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in\nthe world! But what am I to do if I love her?\" he thought, and he\ninvoluntarily groaned, from a habit acquired during his sufferings.\n\nOn hearing that sound Natasha put down the stocking, leaned nearer\nto him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to\nhim and bent over him.\n\n\"You are not asleep?\"\n\n\"No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in.\nNo one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do...\nthat light. I want to weep for joy.\"\n\nNatasha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.\n\n\"Natasha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.\"\n\n\"And I!\"--She turned away for an instant. \"Why too much?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your\nsoul, your whole soul--shall I live? What do you think?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, sure!\" Natasha almost shouted, taking hold of both\nhis hands with a passionate movement.\n\nHe remained silent awhile.\n\n\"How good it would be!\" and taking her hand he kissed it.\n\nNatasha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this\nwould not do and that he had to be quiet.\n\n\"But you have not slept,\" she said, repressing her joy. \"Try to\nsleep... please!\"\n\nHe pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle\nand sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked\nat him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on\nher stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.\n\nSoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep\nlong and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.\n\nAs he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now\nalways occupied his mind--about life and death, and chiefly about\ndeath. He felt himself nearer to it.\n\n\"Love? What is love?\" he thought.\n\n\"Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I\nunderstand, I understand only because I love. Everything is,\neverything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it\nalone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall\nreturn to the general and eternal source.\" These thoughts seemed to\nhim comforting. But they were only thoughts. Something was lacking\nin them, they were not clear, they were too one-sidedly personal and\nbrain-spun. And there was the former agitation and obscurity. He\nfell asleep.\n\nHe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but\nthat he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and\ninsignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and\ndiscussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.\nPrince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had\nmore important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by\nempty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to\ndisappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded\nall else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything\ndepended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went,\nand tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he\nwould not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all\nhis powers. He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was\nthe fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was\nclumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the\nother side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in.\nSomething not human--death--was breaking in through that door, and had\nto be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it\nback--to lock it was no longer possible--but his efforts were weak and\nclumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and\nclosed again.\n\nOnce again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts\nwere vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It\nentered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died.\n\nBut at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was\nasleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he\nawoke.\n\n\"Yes, it was death! I died--and woke up. Yes, death is an\nawakening!\" And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil\nthat had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual\nvision. He felt as if powers till then confined within him had been\nliberated, and that strange lightness did not again leave him.\n\nWhen, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan,\nNatasha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer\nand looked at her strangely, not understanding.\n\nThat was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary\'s\narrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting\nfever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did\nnot interest Natasha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her\nwere more convincing.\n\nFrom that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew\ntogether with his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration\nof life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep\ncompared to the duration of a dream.\n\nThere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow\nawakening.\n\nHis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both\nPrincess Mary and Natasha, who did not leave him, felt this. They\ndid not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves\nfelt that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he\nhad left them) but on what reminded them most closely of him--his\nbody. Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of\ndeath did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment\ntheir grief. Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep,\nnor did they ever talk to one another about him. They felt that they\ncould not express in words what they understood.\n\nThey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and\ndeeper, away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so\nand that it was right.\n\nHe confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of\nhim. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the\nboy\'s and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess\nMary and Natasha understood that) but simply because he thought it was\nall that was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy,\nhe did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there\nwas anything else he should do.\n\nWhen the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,\noccurred, Princess Mary and Natasha were present.\n\n\"Is it over?\" said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes\nlain motionless, growing cold before them. Natasha went up, looked\nat the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but\ndid not kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of\nhim--his body.\n\n\"Where has he gone? Where is he now?...\"\n\nWhen the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,\neveryone came to take leave of him and they all wept.\n\nLittle Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful\nperplexity. The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and\nbecause he was no more. The old count cried because he felt that\nbefore long, he, too, must take the same terrible step.\n\nNatasha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their\nown personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion\nwhich had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of\nthe simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in\ntheir presence.');

And\nwithout considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions\nany one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he\nsnatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him\nintelligible and says: \"This is the cause!\" In historical events\n(where the actions of men are the subject of observation) the first\nand most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the\ngods and, after that, the will of those who stood in the most\nprominent position--the heroes of history. But we need only penetrate\nto the essence of any historic event--which lies in the activity of\nthe general mass of men who take part in it--to be convinced that the\nwill of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but\nis itself continually controlled. It may seem to be a matter of\nindifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events\nthis way or that; yet there is the same difference between a man who\nsays that the people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon\nwished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to\nhappen, as there is between those who declared that the earth was\nstationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted\nthat they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there were laws\ndirecting its movement and that of the other planets. There is, and\ncan be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all\ncauses. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws\nare known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.\nThe discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite\nabandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,\njust as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was\npossible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the\nearth.\n\nThe historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodino and the\noccupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the\nmost important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the\nRussian army from the Ryazana to the Kaluga road and to the Tarutino\ncamp--the so-called flank march across the Krasnaya Pakhra River. They\nascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and\ndispute as to whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians,\nincluding the French, acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders\nwhen they speak of that flank march. But it is hard to understand\nwhy military writers, and following them others, consider this flank\nmarch to be the profound conception of some one man who saved Russia\nand destroyed Napoleon. In the first place it is hard to understand\nwhere the profundity and genius of this movement lay, for not much\nmental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army\nwhen it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions;\nand even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best\nposition for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on\nthe Kaluga road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning\nthe historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a\nprofound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why\nthey think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and\ndestroy the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded,\naccompanied, or followed by other circumstances, might have proved\nruinous to the Russians and salutary for the French. If the position\nof the Russian army really began to improve from the time of that\nmarch, it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it.\n\nThat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to\nthe Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its\ndestruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If\nMurat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained\ninactive? If the Russian army at Krasnaya Pakhra had given battle as\nBennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French\nattacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhra? What\nwould have happened if on approaching Tarutino, Napoleon had\nattacked the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when\nhe attacked them at Smolensk? What would have happened had the\nFrench moved on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank\nmarch that brought salvation might have proved disastrous.\n\nThe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying\nhistory deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be\nattributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in\nreality, like the retreat from Fili, it did not suggest itself to\nanyone in its entirety, but resulted--moment by moment, step by\nstep, event by event--from an endless number of most diverse\ncircumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been\naccomplished and belonged to the past.\n\nAt the council at Fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the\nRussian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely,\na direct retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of this there is the\nfact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and\nabove all there is the well-known conversation after the council,\nbetween the commander in chief and Lanskoy, who was in charge of the\ncommissariat department. Lanskoy informed the commander in chief\nthat the army supplies were for the most part stored along the Oka\nin the Tula and Ryazan provinces, and that if they retreated on Nizhni\nthe army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river\nOka, which cannot be crossed early in winter. This was the first\nindication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously\nseemed the most natural course--a direct retreat on Nizhni-Novgorod.\nThe army turned more to the south, along the Ryazan road and nearer to\nits supplies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French (who even\nlost sight of the Russian army), concern for the safety of the arsenal\nat Tula, and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its\nsupplies caused the army to turn still further south to the Tula road.\nHaving crossed over, by a forced march, to the Tula road beyond the\nPakhra, the Russian commanders intended to remain at Podolsk and had\nno thought of the Tarutino position; but innumerable circumstances and\nthe reappearance of French troops who had for a time lost touch with\nthe Russians, and projects of giving battle, and above all the\nabundance of provisions in Kaluga province, obliged our army to turn\nstill more to the south and to cross from the Tula to the Kaluga\nroad and go to Tarutino, which was between the roads along which those\nsupplies lay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to\nabandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say precisely when, or by whom,\nit was decided to move to Tarutino. Only when the army had got\nthere, as the result of innumerable and varying forces, did people\nbegin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and\nlong ago foreseen its result.');

At Tarutino Kutuzov received what was almost a\nreprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army along the\nRyazan road, and the Emperor\'s letter indicated to him the very\nposition he had already occupied near Kaluga.\n\nHaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the\nwhole campaign and by the battle of Borodino, the Russian army--when\nthe strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was\nreceived--assumed the position natural to it.\n\nKutuzov\'s merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as\nit is called, but in the fact that he alone understood the\nsignificance of what had happened. He alone then understood the\nmeaning of the French army\'s inactivity, he alone continued to\nassert that the battle of Borodino had been a victory, he alone--who\nas commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to\nattack--employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian army\nfrom useless engagements.\n\nThe beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had\nleft him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and\nmerely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was\nheard to moan.\n\nThe moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed\nits calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov\'s\ncamp with overtures for peace.\n\nNapoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head\nwas right, wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him,\nthough they were meaningless.\n\n\nMONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my\nadjutants-general to discuss several interesting questions with you. I\nbeg your Highness to credit what he says to you, especially when he\nexpresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long\nentertained for your person. This letter having no other object, I\npray God, monsieur le Prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and\ngracious protection!\n\nNAPOLEON\n\nMOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812\n\n\nKutuzov replied: \"I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on\nas the initiator of a settlement of any sort.

Though the condition and numbers of the French\narmy were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the\nneed of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These\nsigns were: Lauriston\'s mission; the abundance of provisions at\nTarutino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and\ndisorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the\nfine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and\nthe impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually\nshows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what\nthe French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with\nwhich our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at\nTarutino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and\nguerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire\nfor revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the\nFrench were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every\nsoldier\'s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed\nand that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial\nchange in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable.\nAnd at once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the\nminute hand has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an\nincreased activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.');

Before the news of the abandonment of\nMoscow had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole\ncampaign had been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for his guidance.\nThough this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow\nwas still in our hands, it was approved by the staff and accepted as a\nbasis for action. Kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from\na distance were always difficult to execute. So fresh instructions\nwere sent for the solution of difficulties that might be\nencountered, as well as fresh people who were to watch Kutuzov\'s\nactions and report upon them.\n\nBesides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now\nreorganized. The posts left vacant by Bagration, who had been\nkilled, and by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be\nfilled. Very serious consideration was given to the question whether\nit would be better to put A in B\'s place and B in D\'s, or on the\ncontrary to put D in A\'s place, and so on--as if anything more than\nA\'s or B\'s satisfaction depended on this.\n\nAs a result of the hostility between Kutuzov and Bennigsen, his\nChief of Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the\nEmperor, and these transfers, a more than usually complicated play\nof parties was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining\nB, D was undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and\npermutations. In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was\ngenerally the conduct of the war, which all these men believed they\nwere directing; but this affair of the war went on independently of\nthem, as it had to go: that is, never in the way people devised, but\nflowing always from the essential attitude of the masses. Only in\nthe highest spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and\ninterminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen.\n\n\nPrince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of\nOctober in a letter that reached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino)\nSince September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last\nreports were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not\nonly has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of\nthe ancient capital, but according to your last report you have even\nretreated farther. Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy\ndetachment and Tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the\narmy, is in danger. From General Wintzingerode\'s reports, I see that\nan enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road.\nAnother corps of several thousand men is moving on Dmitrov. A third\nhas advanced along the Vladimir road, and a fourth, rather\nconsiderable detachment is stationed between Ruza and Mozhaysk.\nNapoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth. In view of\nall this information, when the enemy has scattered his forces in large\ndetachments, and with Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it\npossible that the enemy\'s forces confronting you are so considerable\nas not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is\nprobably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with an army\ncorps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem\nthat, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might\nadvantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least\noblige him to retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the\nprovinces now occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger\nfrom Tula and other towns in the interior. You will be responsible\nif the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against\nPetersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been\npossible to retain many troops; for with the army entrusted to you,\nand acting with resolution and energy, you have ample means to avert\nthis fresh calamity. Remember that you have still to answer to our\noffended country for the loss of Moscow. You have experienced my\nreadiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken in me, but I\nand Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and\nsuccess which your intellect, military talent, and the courage of\nthe troops you command justify us in expecting.\n\n\nBut by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation\nof the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was\ndispatched, Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain\nthe army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.\n\nOn the second of October a Cossack, Shapovalov, who was out\nscouting, killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded\nhare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left\nflank of Murat\'s army, encamped there without any precautions. The\nCossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the\nhands of the French. A cornet, hearing the story, informed his\ncommander.\n\nThe Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished\nto take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of\nthe superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,\nreported the incident to a general on the staff.  The state of\nthings on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Ermolov had\nbeen to see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to\nuse his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take\nthe offensive.\n\n\"If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you\nare asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure\nto do the opposite,\" replied Bennigsen.\n\nThe Cossack\'s report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent\nout, was the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled\nspring was released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to\nplay. Despite all his supposed power, his intellect, his experience,\nand his knowledge of men, Kutuzov--having taken into consideration the\nCossack\'s report, a note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to\nthe Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the\nfact that all the generals expressed the same wish--could no longer\ncheck the inevitable movement, and gave the order to do what he\nregarded as useless and harmful--gave his approval, that is, to the\naccomplished fact.');

Toll read them to Ermolov, asking him to attend to the\nfurther arrangements.\n\n\"All right--all right. I haven\'t time just now,\" replied Ermolov,\nand left the hut.\n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the\nAusterlitz dispositions, it was written--though not in German this\ntime:\n\n\"The First Column will march here and here,\" \"the Second Column will\nmarch there and there,\" and so on; and on paper, all these columns\narrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.\nEverything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,\nand as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at\nthe appointed time.\n\nWhen the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been\nprepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to\nErmolov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutuzov\'s\norderly, pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him,\nwent to Ermolov\'s quarters.\n\n\"Gone away,\" said Ermolov\'s orderly.\n\nThe officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom\nErmolov was often to be found.\n\n\"No, and the general\'s out too.\"\n\nThe officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.\n\n\"No, he\'s gone out.\"\n\n\"If only they don\'t make me responsible for this delay! What a\nnuisance it is!\" thought the officer, and he rode round the whole\ncamp. One man said he had seen Ermolov ride past with some other\ngenerals, others said he must have returned home. The officer searched\ntill six o\'clock in the evening without even stopping to eat.\nErmolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was. The\nofficer snatched a little food at a comrade\'s, and rode again to the\nvanguard to find Miloradovich. Miloradovich too was away, but here\nhe was told that he had gone to a ball at General Kikin\'s and that\nErmolov was probably there too.\n\n\"But where is it?\"\n\n\"Why, there, over at Echkino,\" said a Cossack officer, pointing to a\ncountry house in the far distance.\n\n\"What, outside our line?\"\n\n\"They\'ve put two regiments as outposts, and they\'re having such a\nspree there, it\'s awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!\"\n\nThe officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino. While still at a\ndistance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier\'s dance\nsong proceeding from the house.\n\n\"In the meadows... in the meadows!\" he heard, accompanied by\nwhistling and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by\nshouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he\nwas afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner\nthe important order entrusted to him. It was already past eight\no\'clock. He dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country\nhouse which had remained intact between the Russian and French forces.\nIn the refreshment room and the hall, footmen were bustling about with\nwine and viands. Groups of singers stood outside the windows. The\nofficer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the\narmy together, and among them Ermolov\'s big imposing figure. They\nall had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle\nwith flushed and animated faces, laughing loudly. In the middle of the\nroom a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak\nwith much spirit and agility.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivanych! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nThe officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a\nmoment he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait;\nbut one of the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come\nabout, informed Ermolov.\n\nErmolov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what\nthe officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.\n\n\n\"You think he went off just by chance?\" said a comrade, who was on\nthe staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards,\nreferring to Ermolov. \"It was a trick.

He sat in the caleche, dozing and waking up by turns,\nand listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication\nthat the action had begun. But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn\nmorning was just dawning. On approaching Tarutino Kutuzov noticed\ncavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which\nhe was driving. Kutuzov looked at them searchingly, stopped his\ncarriage, and inquired what regiment they belonged to. They belonged\nto a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long\nbefore then. \"It may be a mistake,\" thought the old commander in\nchief.

Getting out of his caleche, he waited\nwith drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down.\nWhen Eykhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned,\nappeared, Kutuzov went purple in the face, not because that officer\nwas to blame for the mistake, but because he was an object of\nsufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on.

Another\nman, Captain Brozin, who happened to turn up and who was not at all to\nblame, suffered the same fate.\n\n\"What sort of another blackguard are you?

It was an autumn night with\ndark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy,\nand the troops advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of\nthe artillery could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk\nout loud, to smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried\nto prevent their horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking\nheightened its charm and they marched gaily. Some columns,\nsupposing they had reached their destination, halted, piled arms, and\nsettled down on the cold ground, but the majority marched all night\nand arrived at places where they evidently should not have been.\n\nOnly Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cossacks (the least important\ndetachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time.\nThis detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path\nleading from the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk.\n\nToward dawn, Count Orlov-Denisov, who had dozed off, was awakened by\na deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a\nPolish sergeant of Poniatowski\'s corps, who explained in Polish that\nhe had come over because he had been slighted in the service: that\nhe ought long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver\nthan any of them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them\nout. He said that Murat was spending the night less than a mile from\nwhere they were, and that if they would let him have a convoy of a\nhundred men he would capture him alive. Count Orlov-Denisov\nconsulted his fellow officers.\n\nThe offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go\nand everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and\narguing, Major-General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided to go\nwith the Polish sergeant.\n\n\"Now, remember,\" said Count Orlov-Denisov to the sergeant at\nparting, \"if you have been lying I\'ll have you hanged like a dog;\nbut if it\'s true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!\"\n\nWithout replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and\nrode away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled. They\ndisappeared into the forest, and Count Orlov-Denisov, having seen\nGrekov off, returned, shivering from the freshness of the early dawn\nand excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility, and\nbegan looking at the enemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive\nlight of dawn and the dying campfires. Our columns ought to have begun\nto appear on an open declivity to his right. He looked in that\ndirection, but though the columns would have been visible quite far\noff, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count that things were\nbeginning to stir in the French camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant\nconfirmed this.\n\n\"Oh, it is really too late,\" said Count Orlov, looking at the camp.\n\nAs often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before\nour eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the\nsergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian\nattack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which he\nwould lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a\ncommander in chief from among such a mass of troops!\n\n\"I am sure that rascal was lying,\" said the count.\n\n\"They can still be called back,\" said one of his suite, who like\nCount Orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the\nenemy\'s camp.\n\n\"Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?\"\n\n\"Will you have them fetched back?\"\n\n\"Fetch them back, fetch them back!\" said Count Orlov with sudden\ndetermination, looking at his watch. \"It will be too late. It is quite\nlight.\"\n\nAnd the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grekov. When\nGrekov returned, Count Orlov-Denisov, excited both by the abandoned\nattempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not\nappear, as well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance.\nAll his men felt the same excitement.\n\n\"Mount!\" he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and\ncrossed themselves.... \"Forward, with God\'s aid!\"\n\n\"Hurrah-ah-ah!\" reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack\ncompanies, trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if\npoured out of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.\n\nOne desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw\nthe Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just\nwaking up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and\nhorses.\n\nHad the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind\nand around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.\nThat was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the\nCossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of\nthem listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight\nguns were taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most\nimportant to the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like.\nAll this had to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the\nbooty divided--not without some shouting and even a little fighting\namong themselves--and it was on this that the Cossacks all busied\nthemselves.\n\nThe French, not being farther pursued, began to recover\nthemselves: they formed into detachments and began firing.\nOrlov-Denisov, still waiting for the other columns to arrive, advanced\nno further.\n\nMeantime, according to the dispositions which said that \"the First\nColumn will march\" and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,\ncommanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due\norder and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their\nappointed places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully,\nbegan to halt; murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and\nfinally a backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about,\nshouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and\nwere late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and\nwent forward, simply to get somewhere. \"We shall get somewhere or\nother!\" And they did indeed get somewhere, though not to their right\nplaces; a few eventually even got to their right place, but too late\nto be of any use and only in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this\nbattle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped\nassiduously from place to place, finding everything upside down\neverywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagovut\'s corps in a wood when it\nwas already broad daylight, though the corps should long before have\njoined Orlov-Denisov. Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing\nthat someone must be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the\ncommander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely, saying\nthat he ought to be shot. General Bagovut, a fighting old soldier of\nplacid temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion,\nand cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody\'s surprise and quite\ncontrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll.\n\n\"I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men\nas well as anybody,\" he said, and advanced with a single division.\n\nComing out onto a field under the enemy\'s fire, this brave general\nwent straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering\nin his agitation whether going into action now, with a single\ndivision, would be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets\nwere just what he needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets\nkilled him, and other bullets killed many of his men. And his division\nremained under fire for some time quite uselessly.');

He did\nnot advance.\n\nHe rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering\nsuggestions that they should attack.\n\n\"The word attack is always on your tongue, but you don\'t see that we\nare unable to execute complicated maneuvers,\" said he to\nMiloradovich who asked permission to advance.\n\n\"We couldn\'t take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in\ntime, and nothing can be done now!\" he replied to someone else.\n\nWhen Kutuzov was informed that at the French rear--where according\nto the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody--there\nwere now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Ermolov\nwho was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous\nday.\n\n\"You see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,\nbut as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,\nforewarned, takes measures accordingly.\"\n\nErmolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these\nwords. He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that\nKutuzov would content himself with that hint.\n\n\"He\'s having a little fun at my expense,\" said Ermolov softly,\nnudging with his knee Raevski who was at his side.\n\nSoon after this, Ermolov moved up to Kutuzov and respectfully\nremarked:\n\n\"It is not too late yet, your Highness--the enemy has not gone\naway--if you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so\nmuch as see a little smoke.\"\n\nKutuzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat\'s\ntroops were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every\nhundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour.\n\nThe whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov\'s Cossacks had\ndone: the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.\n\nIn consequence of this battle Kutuzov received a diamond decoration,\nand Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also\nreceived pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various\ngrades, and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.\n\n\"That\'s how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!\" said the\nRussian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be\nunderstood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that\nwe ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today.\nBut people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking\nabout or deliberately deceive themselves. No battle--Tarutino,\nBorodino, or Austerlitz--takes place as those who planned it\nanticipated. That is an essential condition.\n\nA countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than\nduring a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence\nthe course taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in\nadvance and never coincides with the direction of any one force.\n\nIf many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a\ngiven body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one\nof those forces, but will always be a mean--what in mechanics is\nrepresented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.\n\nIf in the descriptions given by historians, especially French\nones, we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with\npreviously formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those\ndescriptions are false.\n\nThe battle of Tarutino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in\nview--to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the\ndispositions; nor that which Count Orlov-Denisov may have had in\nview--to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying\nthe whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor\nthe aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish\nhimself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got,\nand so on. But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and\nwhat all the Russians of that day desired--to drive the French out of\nRussia and destroy their army--it is quite clear that the battle of\nTarutino, just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was\nwanted at that stage of the campaign. It would be difficult and even\nimpossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual\noutcome of this battle. With a minimum of effort and insignificant\nlosses, despite the greatest confusion, the most important results of\nthe whole campaign were attained: the transition from retreat to\nadvance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the\nadministration of that shock which Napoleon\'s army had only awaited to\nbegin its flight.');

The Russians retreat and abandon their\nancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and\nincalculable wealth, is in Napoleon\'s hands. The Russian army, only\nhalf the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to\nattack for a whole month. Napoleon\'s position is most brilliant. He\ncan either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and\ndestroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal\nmake a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse,\nreturn to Smolensk or Vilna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special\ngenius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position\nthe French held at that time. For that, only very simple and easy\nsteps were necessary: not to allow the troops to loot, to prepare\nwinter clothing--of which there was sufficient in Moscow for the whole\narmy--and methodically to collect the provisions, of which\n(according to the French historians) there were enough in Moscow to\nsupply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of\nall geniuses, who the historians declare had control of the army, took\nnone of these steps.\n\nHe not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used\nhis power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses\nopen to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in\nMoscow, advancing on Petersburg or on Nizhni-Novgorod, or retiring\nby a more northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kutuzov\nafterwards took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined\nthan what he actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting\nthe troops plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a\ngarrison behind him, he quitted Moscow, approached Kutuzov without\njoining battle, turned to the right and reached Malo-Yaroslavets,\nagain without attempting to break through and take the road Kutuzov\ntook, but retiring instead to Mozhaysk along the devastated Smolensk\nroad. Nothing more stupid than that could have been devised, or more\ndisastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon\'s aim been\nto destroy his army, the most skillful strategist could hardly have\ndevised any series of actions that would so completely have\naccomplished that purpose, independently of anything the Russian\narmy might do.\n\nNapoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he\ndestroyed his army because he wished to, or because he was very\nstupid, would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to\nMoscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a\ngenius.\n\nIn both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the\npersonal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws\nthat guided the event.\n\nThe historians quite falsely represent Napoleon\'s faculties as\nhaving weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did\nnot justify his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to\ndo the best he could for himself and his army, as he had done\npreviously and as he did subsequently in 1813. His activity at that\ntime was no less astounding than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in\nAustria, and in Prussia. We do not know for certain in how far his\ngenius was genuine in Egypt--where forty centuries looked down upon\nhis grandeur--for his great exploits there are all told us by\nFrenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria or\nPrussia, for we have to draw our information from French or German\nsources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without\nfighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans to\nrecognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on\nin Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius in\norder to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the\nmatter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.\n\nHis activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as\nelsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued\nby him from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The\nabsence of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of\nMoscow, did not disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the\nwelfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare\nof the people of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or\nof diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated\npeace.');

Then he gave careful\ndirections about the fortification of the Kremlin, and drew up a\nbrilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of Russia.\n\nWith regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain\nYakovlev, who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how\nto get out of Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and\nhis magnanimity, and having written a letter to the Emperor\nAlexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his Friend\nand Brother that Rostopchin had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he\ndispatched Yakovlev to Petersburg.\n\nHaving similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to\nTutolmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.\n\nWith regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave\norders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel\nRostopchin was punished by an order to burn down his houses.\n\nWith regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a\nconstitution. A municipality was established and the following\nannouncement issued:\n\n\nINHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!\n\nYour misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King\ndesires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you\nhow he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been\ntaken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A\npaternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form\nyour municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of\nyour needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished\nby a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city\nwill wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only\nwear a red ribbon round the left arm.\n\nThe city police is established on its former footing, and better\norder already prevails in consequence of its activity. The\ngovernment has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of\npolice, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been\nappointed to the different wards of the city. You will recognize\nthem by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several\nchurches of different denominations are open, and divine service is\nperformed in them unhindered. Your fellow citizens are returning every\nday to their homes and orders have been given that they should find\nin them the help and protection due to their misfortunes. These are\nthe measures the government has adopted to re-establish order and\nrelieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it is necessary that\nyou should add your efforts and should, if possible, forget the\nmisfortunes you have suffered, should entertain the hope of a less\ncruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death\nawaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains\nof your property, and finally that you should not doubt that these\nwill be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest and most\njust of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you may\nbe, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of a\nstate, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to\nanother, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the\nmilitary and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to\nflow!\n\n\nWith regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all\nthe troops in turn should enter Moscow a la maraude* to obtain\nprovisions for themselves, so that the army might have its future\nprovided for.\n\n\n*As looters.\n\n\nWith regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be\nbrought back and services to be again performed in the churches.\n\nWith regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the\nfollowing was placarded everywhere:\n\n\nPROCLAMATION!\n\nYou, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom\nmisfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of\nthe soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!\nTranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being\nrestored in it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from\ntheir hiding places on finding that they are respected. Any violence\nto them or to their property is promptly punished. His Majesty the\nEmperor and King protects them, and considers no one among you his\nenemy except those who disobey his orders. He desires to end your\nmisfortunes and restore you to your homes and families. Respond,\ntherefore, to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear.\nInhabitants, return with confidence to your abodes! You will soon find\nmeans of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen and industrious artisans,\nreturn to your work, your houses, your shops, where the protection\nof guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay for your work.\nAnd lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where you are\nhiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full\nassurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in\nthe city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the\nproducts of the soil. The government has taken the following steps\nto ensure freedom of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants,\nhusbandmen, and those living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without\nany danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets,\nof which one is on the Mokhovaya Street and the other at the Provision\nMarket. (2) Such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as\nseller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a\nfair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and\nno one may hinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday\nof each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end\na sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on\nTuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect\nthe carts. (4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their\ncarts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey.\n(5) Steps will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.\n\nInhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and\nartisans, to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry\nout the paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to\nco-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and\nconfidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!\n\n\nWith the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the\npeople, reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The\nEmperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and,\ndespite his preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the\ntheaters that were established by his order.\n\nIn regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,\nNapoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma\nMere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining\ntender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He\nvisited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by\nhim to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tutolmin. Then,\nas Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in\nforged Russian money which he had prepared: \"Raising the use of\nthese means by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let\nrelief be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food\nwas too precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part\nenemies, Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to\npurchase food from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.\"\n\nWith reference to army discipline, orders were continually being\nissued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military\nduties and to suppress robbery.');

Fain to prove that this work of genius must be\nreferred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October--that plan\nnever was or could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the\nfacts of the case. The fortifying of the Kremlin, for which la Mosquee\n(as Napoleon termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have\nbeen razed to the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the\nKremlin only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon\'s wish that it should\nbe blown up when he left Moscow--as a child wants the floor on which\nhe has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army,\nabout which Napoleon was so concerned, produced an unheard-of result.\nThe French generals lost touch with the Russian army of sixty thousand\nmen, and according to Thiers it was only eventually found, like a lost\npin, by the skill--and apparently the genius--of Murat.\n\nWith reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon\'s arguments as to his\nmagnanimity and justice, both to Tutolmin and to Yakovlev (whose chief\nconcern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;\nAlexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their\nembassage.\n\nWith regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed\nincendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.\n\nWith regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a\nmunicipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain\npeople who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of\npreserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from\nbeing looted.\n\nWith regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so\neasily been settled by Napoleon\'s visit to a mosque, no results were\nachieved. Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to\ncarry out Napoleon\'s wish, but one of them was slapped in the face\nby a French soldier while conducting service, and a French official\nreported of another that: \"The priest whom I found and invited to\nsay Mass cleaned and locked up the church. That night the doors were\nagain broken open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and\nother disorders perpetrated.\"\n\nWith reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious\nworkmen and to peasants evoked no response. There were no\nindustrious workmen, and the peasants caught the commissaries who\nventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them.\n\nAs to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the\ntroops, these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in\nthe Kremlin and in Posnyakov\'s house were closed again at once because\nthe actors and actresses were robbed.\n\nEven philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as\nwell as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The\nFrench, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the\npaper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to\nthe unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.\n\nBut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders\ngiven by the authorities at that time was Napoleon\'s attempt to stop\nthe looting and re-establish discipline.\n\nThis is what the army authorities were reporting:\n\n\"Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order\nis not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade\nin a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they\nsell stolen goods.\"\n\n\"The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of\nthe 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate\ninhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have\nthe ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly\nwitnessed.\"\n\n\"Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and\npillaging--October 9.\"\n\n\"Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our\ndistrict who ought to be arrested by a strong force--October 11.\"\n\n\"The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict\norders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually\nseen returning to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and\npillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening,\nlast night, and today. The Emperor sees with regret that the picked\nsoldiers appointed to guard his person, who should set an example of\ndiscipline, carry disobedience to such a point that they break into\nthe cellars and stores containing army supplies. Others have disgraced\nthemselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers, and\nhave abused and beaten them.\"\n\n\"The Grand Marshal of the palace,\" wrote the governor, \"complains\nbitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to\ncommit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows\nof the Emperor.\"\n\nThat army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot\nthe provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated\nand perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it\ndid not go away.\n\nIt began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused\nby the capture of transport trains on the Smolensk road, and by the\nbattle of Tarutino. The news of that battle of Tarutino,\nunexpectedly received by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a\ndesire to punish the Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the order\nfor departure which the whole army was demanding.\n\nFleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they\nhad stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal tresor, but\non seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers\nsays) horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not\norder all the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with\nthose of a certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the\ncaleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that\nit was a very good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry\nprovisions, the sick, and the wounded.\n\nThe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which\nfeels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the\nskillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it\nentered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps\nand shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded\nanimal, hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter\'s gun, runs\nforward and back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under\npressure from his whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the\nbattle of Tarutino frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto\nthe hunter\'s gun, reached him, turned back, and finally--like any wild\nbeast--ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path,\nwhere the old scent was familiar.\n\nDuring the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have\nbeen the leader of all these movements--as the figurehead of a ship\nmay seem to a savage to guide the vessel--acted like a child who,\nholding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving\nit.');

This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside\nKarataev at night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but\nalways returned again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it\nstill belonged to nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor;\nthe soldier who told stories called it Femgalka; Karataev and others\ncalled it Gray, or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name,\nor even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the\nblue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round\nas a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that it would often\ngracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three\nlegs, as if disdaining to use all four. Everything pleased it. Now\nit would roll on its back, yelping with delight, now bask in the sun\nwith a thoughtful air of importance, and now frolic about playing with\na chip of wood or a straw.\n\nPierre\'s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only\nremnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier\'s trousers which by\nKarataev\'s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and\na peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this\ntime. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of\nsolidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache\ncovered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested\nwith lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes\nwas resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The\nformer slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now\nreplaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet\nwere bare.\n\nPierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and\nhorsemen were passing that morning, then into the distance across\nthe river, then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about\nbiting him, and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in\nvarious positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he\nlooked at his bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction\nflitted across his face. The sight of them reminded him of all he\nhad experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection\nwas pleasant to him.\n\nFor some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts\nin the mornings--what is called an \"old wives\' summer.\"\n\nIn the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly\npleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in\nthe air.\n\nOn everything--far and near--lay the magic crystal glitter seen only\nat that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,\nwith the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare\ntrees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green\nchurch spire, and the corners of the white house in the distance,\nall stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with\nunnatural clearness. Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a\nhalf-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still\nshowing dark green beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled\nhouse--which in dull weather was repulsively ugly--seemed quietly\nbeautiful now, in the clear, motionless brilliance.\n\nA French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a\nskullcap on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from\nbehind a corner of the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly\nwink.\n\n\"What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!\" (Their name for Pierre.) \"Eh?\nJust like spring!\"\n\nAnd the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his\npipe, though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.\n\n\"To be on the march in such weather...\" he began.\n\nPierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the\ncorporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there\nought to be an order about the prisoners that day. Sokolov, one of the\nsoldiers in the shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the\ncorporal that something should be done about him. The corporal replied\nthat Pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a\npermanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick, and\nthat in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by\nthe authorities.\n\n\"Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the\ncaptain, you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to\nthe captain when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.\"\n\n(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with\nPierre and showed him all sorts of favors.)\n\n\"\'You see, St. Thomas,\' he said to me the other day. \'Monsieur Kiril\nis a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who\nhas had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what\'s what.... If he\nwants anything and asks me, he won\'t get a refusal. When one has\nstudied, you see, one likes education and well-bred people.\' It is for\nyour sake I mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not\nbeen for you that affair would have ended ill.\"\n\nAnd after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The\naffair he had alluded to had happened a few days before--a fight\nbetween the prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had\nsucceeded in pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had\nheard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the\nFrenchman had said. While Pierre was repeating what he had been told\nabout the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier\ncame up to the door of the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his\nfingers to his forehead by way of greeting, he asked Pierre whether\nthe soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that\nshed.\n\nA week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to\nthem, which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into\nboots and shirts for them.\n\n\"Ready, ready, dear fellow!\" said Karataev, coming out with a neatly\nfolded shirt.\n\nKarataev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at\nwork, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot.\nHis hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree\nbast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.\n\n\"A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here\nit is, ready,\" said Platon, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had\nsewn.\n\nThe Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his\nhesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had\na long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin\nbare body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking\non would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly.\nNone of the prisoners said a word.\n\n\"See, it fits well!\" Platon kept repeating, pulling the shirt\nstraight.\n\nThe Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without\nraising his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.\n\n\"You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper\ntools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,\"\nsaid Platon with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his\nwork.\n\n\"It\'s good, quite good, thank you,\" said the Frenchman, in French,\n\"but there must be some linen left over.\n\n\"It will fit better still when it sets to your body,\" said Karataev,\nstill admiring his handiwork. \"You\'ll be nice and comfortable....\"\n\n\"Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?\" said the\nFrenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note\nand gave it to Karataev. \"But give me the pieces that are over.\"\n\nPierre saw that Platon did not want to understand what the Frenchman\nwas saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karataev thanked the\nFrenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The\nFrenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over\nand asked Pierre to translate what he said.\n\n\"What does he want the bits for?\" said Karataev. \"They\'d make fine\nleg bands for us. Well, never mind.\"\n\nAnd Karataev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression,\ntook a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the\nFrenchman without looking at him. \"Oh dear!\" muttered Karataev and\nwent away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment,\nthen looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre\'s look had told\nhim something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:\n\n\"Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!\" And handing back the\nodd bits he turned and went out.\n\n\"There, look at that,\" said Karataev, swaying his head. \"People said\nthey were not Christians, but they too have souls. It\'s what the old\nfolk used to say: \'A sweating hand\'s an open hand, a dry hand\'s\nclose.\' He\'s naked, but yet he\'s given it back.\"\n\nKarataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the\npieces.\n\n\"But they\'ll make grand leg bands, dear friend,\" he said, and went\nback into the shed.');

And just at this\ntime he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly\nstriven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different ways that\ntranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so impressed him in\nthe soldiers at the battle of Borodino. He had sought it in\nphilanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, in\nwine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in romantic love for\nNatasha; he had sought it by reasoning--and all these quests and\nexperiments had failed him. And now without thinking about it he had\nfound that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death,\nthrough privation, and through what he recognized in Karataev.\n\nThose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as\nit were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the\nagitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important.\nIt did not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or\npolitics, or Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things\nwere no business of his, and that he was not called on to judge\nconcerning them and therefore could not do so. \"Russia and summer\nweather are not bound together,\" he thought, repeating words of\nKarataev\'s which he found strangely consoling. His intention of\nkilling Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of\nthe beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even\nridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should\nnot be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What\nconcern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading\nthe life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and\nespecially to him, whether or not they found out that their prisoner\'s\nname was Count Bezukhov?\n\nHe now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and\nquite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew\'s thoughts\nsomewhat differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that\nhappiness could only be negative, but had said it with a shade of\nbitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire\nfor positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and\nnever be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without any mental\nreservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction of one\'s needs\nand consequent freedom in the choice of one\'s occupation, that is,\nof one\'s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man\'s\nhighest happiness. Here and now for the first time he fully\nappreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking\nwhen he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth\nwhen he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk\nand to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one\'s needs--good food,\ncleanliness, and freedom--now that he was deprived of all this, seemed\nto Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of\noccupation, that is, of his way of life--now that that was so\nrestricted--seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a\nsuperfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying\none\'s needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation--such\nfreedom as his wealth, his education, and his social position had\ngiven him in his own life--is just what makes the choice of occupation\ninsolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of\nhaving an occupation.\n\nAll Pierre\'s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free.\nYet subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke\nwith enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable,\nstrong, joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind\nand inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.\n\nWhen on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn,\nand saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still\ndark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills,\nand the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple\ndistance, when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the\nnoise of the crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when\nafterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun\'s rim appeared\nsolemnly from behind a cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the\nhoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began to sparkle in the\nglad light--Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he\nhad never before known. And this not only stayed with him during the\nwhole of his imprisonment, but even grew in strength as the\nhardships of his position increased.\n\nThat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still\nfurther strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners\nformed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge\nof languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his\nreadiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance\nof three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which\nhe showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut;\nhis gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still\nand thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them\nincomprehensible), he appeared to them a rather mysterious and\nsuperior being. The very qualities that had been a hindrance, if not\nactually harmful, to him in the world he had lived in--his strength,\nhis disdain for the comforts of life, his absent-mindedness and\nsimplicity--here among these people gave him almost the status of a\nhero. And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities\nupon him.');

The sick soldier, Sokolov, pale and thin\nwith dark shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot\nand not dressed. His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his\nface, gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention\nto him, and he moaned regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so\nmuch his sufferings that caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as\nhis fear and grief at being left alone.\n\nPierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes\nKarataev had made for him from some leather a French soldier had\ntorn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with, went\nup to the sick man and squatted down beside him.\n\n\"You know, Sokolov, they are not all going away! They have a\nhospital here. You may be better off than we others,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!\" moaned the man\nin a louder voice.\n\n\"I\'ll go and ask them again directly,\" said Pierre, rising and going\nto the door of the shed.\n\nJust as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him\na pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal\nand soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had\nmetal straps, and these changed their familiar faces.\n\nThe corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The\nprisoners had to be counted before being let out.\n\n\"Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?...\" Pierre began.\n\nBut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal\nhe knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that\nmoment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of\ndrums was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at\nPierre\'s words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door.\nThe shed became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two\nsides drowned the sick man\'s groans.\n\n\"There it is!... It again!...\" said Pierre to himself, and an\ninvoluntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal\'s changed\nface, in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise\nof the drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which\ncompelled people against their will to kill their fellow men--that\nforce the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions. To\nfear or to try to escape that force, to address entreaties or\nexhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless. Pierre\nknew this now. One had to wait and endure. He did not again go to\nthe sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frowning by the\ndoor of the hut.\n\nWhen that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one\nanother like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed\nhis way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal\nhad assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also\nin marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which\nPierre had recognized in the corporal\'s words and in the roll of the\ndrums.\n\n\"Pass on, pass on!\" the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and\nlooking at the prisoners who thronged past him.\n\nPierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.\n\n\"What now?\" the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing\nPierre.\n\nPierre told him about the sick man.\n\n\"He\'ll manage to walk, devil take him!\" said the captain. \"Pass\non, pass on!\" he continued without looking at Pierre.\n\n\"But he is dying,\" Pierre again began.\n\n\"Be so good...\" shouted the captain, frowning angrily.\n\n\"Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...\" rattled the drums, and Pierre\nunderstood that this mysterious force completely controlled these\nmen and that it was now useless to say any more.\n\nThe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to\nmarch in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among\nthem, and about three hundred men.\n\nThe officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all\nstrangers to Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at\nhim and at his shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him\nwalked a fat major with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing\na Kazan dressing gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently\nenjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in\nwhich he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing\ngown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other. Panting\nand puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he\nthought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when\nthey had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something\nwhen there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little\nofficer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now\nbeing taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt\nboots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side\nand gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations\nas to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city\nwas that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a\nPole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was\nmistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.\n\n\"What are you disputing about?\" said the major angrily. \"What does\nit matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it\'s\nburned down, and there\'s an end of it.... What are you pushing for?\nIsn\'t the road wide enough?\" said he, turning to a man behind him\nwho was not pushing him at all.\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?\" the prisoners on one side and\nanother were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. \"All\nbeyond the river, and Zubova, and in the Kremlin.... Just look!\nThere\'s not half of it left. Yes, I told you--the whole quarter beyond\nthe river, and so it is.\"\n\n\"Well, you know it\'s burned, so what\'s the use of talking?\" said the\nmajor.\n\nAs they passed near a church in the Khamovniki (one of the few\nunburned quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly\nstarted to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.\n\n\"Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And\nsmeared with something!\"\n\nPierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked\nthese exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the\npalings surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw\nbetter than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set\nupright against the palings with its face smeared with soot.\n\n\"Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...\" the\nconvoy guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh\nvirulence, drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who\nwere gazing at the dead man.');

From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving\nbaggage trains before and behind them. To the right, where the\nKaluga road turns near Neskuchny, endless rows of troops and carts\nstretched away into the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais\'\ncorps which had started before any of the others. Behind, along the\nriverside and across the Stone Bridge, were Ney\'s troops and\ntransport.\n\nDavout\'s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing\nthe Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kaluga\nroad. But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of\nBeauharnais\' train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the\nKaluga road when the vanguard of Ney\'s army was already emerging\nfrom the Great Ordynka Street.\n\nWhen they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few\nsteps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles\nand men crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few\nhundred paces that separated the bridge from the Kaluga road, taking\nmore than an hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the\nstreets of the Transmoskva ward and the Kaluga road converge, and\nthe prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at\nthat crossway. From all sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard\nthe rattle of wheels, the tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger\nand abuse. Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house,\nlistening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll\nof the drums.\n\nTo get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the\nwall of the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.\n\n\"What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They\'ve loaded goods\neven on the cannon! Look there, those are furs!\" they exclaimed. \"Just\nsee what the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one\nhas behind in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some\nicons, by heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has\nloaded himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they\'ve even grabbed\nthose chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks....\nHeavens! They\'re fighting.\"\n\n\"That\'s right, hit him on the snout--on his snout! Like this, we\nshan\'t get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be\nNapoleon\'s own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown!\nIt\'s like a portable house.... That fellow\'s dropped his sack and\ndoesn\'t see it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not\nbad-looking either! Yes, I dare say, that\'s the way they\'ll let you\npass... Just look, there\'s no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven,\nso they are! In carriages--see how comfortably they\'ve settled\nthemselves!\"\n\nAgain, as at the church in Khamovniki, a wave of general curiosity\nbore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to\nhis stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted\ntheir curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts,\nclosely squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in\nglaring colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.\n\nFrom the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the\nmysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful:\nneither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women\nhurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now\nwitnessed scarcely made an impression on him--as if his soul, making\nready for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might\nweaken it.\n\nThe women\'s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts,\nsoldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers,\nammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women.\n\nPierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.\n\nAll these people and horses seemed driven forward by some\ninvisible power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came\nflowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get\non quickly; they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to\nfight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of\nabuse flew from side to side, and all the faces bore the same\nswaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck\nPierre that morning on the corporal\'s face when the drums were\nbeating.\n\nIt was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the\nescort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way\nin among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all\nsides, emerged onto the Kaluga road.\n\nThey marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the\nsun began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men\nbegan to prepare for their night\'s rest. They all appeared angry and\ndissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could\nbe heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran\ninto one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole.\nSeveral soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat\nthe carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others\nfought among themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly\nwounded on the head by a sword.\n\nIt seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid\nfields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and\nthe same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and\neagerness to push on that had seized them at the start. Once at a\nstandstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know\nwhere they were going, and that much that was painful and difficult\nawaited them on this journey.\n\nDuring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than\nthey had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the\nfirst time received horseflesh for their meat ration.\n\nFrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what\nseemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners, in\nunexpected contrast to their former friendly relations.\n\nThis spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of\nprisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one\nRussian soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had\nescaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for\nstraying too far from the road, and heard his friend the captain\nreprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on\naccount of the escape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned officer\'s\nexcuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk, the officer\nreplied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind. Pierre\nfelt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the\nexecutions, but which he had not felt during his imprisonment, now\nagain controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt that in\nproportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him, there grew\nand strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it.\n\nHe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with\nhis comrades.\n\nNeither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen\nin Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of\nthe order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in\nreaction against the worsening of their position they were all\nparticularly animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences,\nof amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and\navoided all talk of their present situation.\n\nThe sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in\nthe sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon\nfrom the rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely\nin the gray haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night\nhad not yet come. Pierre got up and left his new companions,\ncrossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where\nhe had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed. He\nwanted to talk to them. On the road he was stopped by a French\nsentinel who ordered him back.\n\nPierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an\nunharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him\nand dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of\nthe cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought.\nSuddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured\nlaughter, so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise\nto see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean.\n\n\"Ha-ha-ha!\" laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: \"The\nsoldier did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me\ncaptive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...\" and\nhe laughed till tears started to his eyes.\n\nA man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing\nat all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther\naway from the inquisitive man, and looked around him.\n\nThe huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the\ncrackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the\nred campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the\nlight sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp,\nunseen before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still,\nbeyond those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless\ndistance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the\ntwinkling stars in its faraway depths. \"And all that is me, all that\nis within me, and it is all I!\" thought Pierre. \"And they caught all\nthat and put it into a shed boarded up with planks!\" He smiled, and\nwent and lay down to sleep beside his companions.');

Kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one\nformerly brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no\nquestion of peace.\n\nSoon after that a report was received from Dorokhov\'s guerrilla\ndetachment operating to the left of Tarutino that troops of\nBroussier\'s division had been seen at Forminsk and that being\nseparated from the rest of the French army they might easily be\ndestroyed. The soldiers and officers again demanded action. Generals\non the staff, excited by the memory of the easy victory at Tarutino,\nurged Kutuzov to carry out Dorokhov\'s suggestion. Kutuzov did not\nconsider any offensive necessary. The result was a compromise which\nwas inevitable: a small detachment was sent to Forminsk to attack\nBroussier.\n\nBy a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most\ndifficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhturov--that same\nmodest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing\nup plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering\ncrosses on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was\nspoken of as undecided and undiscerning--but whom we find commanding\nwherever the position was most difficult all through the\nRusso-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he\nremained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what\nwas possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single\ngeneral was left in the rear guard. Ill with fever he went to Smolensk\nwith twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon\'s whole\narmy. In Smolensk, at the Malakhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in\na paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the\ntown--and Smolensk held out all day long. At the battle of Borodino,\nwhen Bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank\nhad fallen and the full force of the French artillery fire was\ndirected against it, the man sent there was this same irresolute and\nundiscerning Dokhturov--Kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he\nhad made by sending someone else there first. And the quiet little\nDokhturov rode thither, and Borodino became the greatest glory of\nthe Russian army. Many heroes have been described to us in verse and\nprose, but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said.\n\nIt was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from there\nto Malo-Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle with the French\nwas fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army\nbegan; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of\nthe campaign, but of Dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that\ndubiously. And this silence about Dokhturov is the clearest\ntestimony to his merit.\n\nIt is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a\nmachine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance\nand is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most\nimportant part. The man who does not understand the construction of\nthe machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which\nrevolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine,\nand not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.\n\nOn the tenth of October when Dokhturov had gone halfway to\nForminsk and stopped at the village of Aristovo, preparing\nfaithfully to execute the orders he had received, the whole French\narmy having, in its convulsive movement, reached Murat\'s position\napparently in order to give battle--suddenly without any reason turned\noff to the left onto the new Kaluga road and began to enter\nForminsk, where only Broussier had been till then. At that time\nDokhturov had under his command, besides Dorokhov\'s detachment, the\ntwo small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslavin.\n\nOn the evening of October 11 Seslavin came to the Aristovo\nheadquarters with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner\nsaid that the troops that had entered Forminsk that day were the\nvanguard of the whole army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army\nhad left Moscow four days previously. That same evening a house serf\nwho had come from Borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering\nthe town. Some Cossacks of Dokhturov\'s detachment reported having\nsighted the French Guards marching along the road to Borovsk. From all\nthese reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a\nsingle division there was now the whole French army marching from\nMoscow in an unexpected direction--along the Kaluga road. Dokhturov\nwas unwilling to undertake any action, as it was not clear to him\nnow what he ought to do. He had been ordered to attack Forminsk. But\nonly Broussier had been there at that time and now the whole French\narmy was there. Ermolov wished to act on his own judgment, but\nDokhturov insisted that he must have Kutuzov\'s instructions. So it was\ndecided to send a dispatch to the staff.\n\nFor this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovitinov, was chosen, who\nwas to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering a\nwritten report. Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov, having received the\ndispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff\naccompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.');

It had been raining for four\ndays. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour\nand a half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka\nafter one o\'clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle\nfence hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he\nentered a dark passage.\n\n\"The general on duty, quick! It\'s very important!\" said he to\nsomeone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.\n\n\"He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third\nnight he has not slept,\" said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper.\n\"You should wake the captain first.\"\n\n\"But this is very important, from General Dokhturov,\" said\nBolkhovitinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in\nthe dark.\n\nThe orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.\n\n\"Your honor, your honor! A courier.\"\n\n\"What? What\'s that? From whom?\" came a sleepy voice.\n\n\"From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich. Napoleon is at Forminsk,\"\nsaid Bolkhovitinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but\nguessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn.\n\nThe man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.\n\n\"I don\'t like waking him,\" he said, fumbling for something. \"He is\nvery ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.\"\n\n\"Here is the dispatch,\" said Bolkhovitinov. \"My orders are to give\nit at once to the general on duty.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, I\'ll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you\nalways hide it?\" said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,\nto the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, Konovnitsyn\'s adjutant.)\n\"I\'ve found it, I\'ve found it!\" he added.\n\nThe orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was fumbling for\nsomething on the candlestick.\n\n\"Oh, the nasty beasts!\" said he with disgust.\n\nBy the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw Shcherbinin\'s\nyouthful face as he held the candle, and the face of another man who\nwas still asleep. This was Konovnitsyn.\n\nWhen the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned\nup, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, from\nthe candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were\nrunning away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovitinov was\nbespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it\nwith his sleeve.\n\n\"Who gave the report?\" inquired Shcherbinin, taking the envelope.\n\n\"The news is reliable,\" said Bolkhovitinov. \"Prisoners, Cossacks,\nand the scouts all say the same thing.\"\n\n\"There\'s nothing to be done, we\'ll have to wake him,\" said\nShcherbinin, rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay\ncovered by a greatcoat. \"Peter Petrovich!\" said he. (Konovnitsyn did\nnot stir.) \"To the General Staff!\" he said with a smile, knowing\nthat those words would be sure to arouse him.\n\nAnd in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On\nKonovnitsyn\'s handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,\nthere still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote\nfrom present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face\nassumed its habitual calm and firm appearance.\n\n\"Well, what is it? From whom?\" he asked immediately but without\nhurry, blinking at the light.\n\nWhile listening to the officer\'s report Konovnitsyn broke the seal\nand read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his\nlegs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began\nputting on his boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair\nover his temples, and donned his cap.\n\n\"Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.\"\n\nKonovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of\ngreat importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or\nask himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest\nhim. He regarded the whole business of the war not with his\nintelligence or his reason but by something else. There was within him\na deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well, but that one\nmust not trust to this and still less speak about it, but must only\nattend to one\'s own work. And he did his work, giving his whole\nstrength to the task.\n\nPeter Petrovich Konovnitsyn, like Dokhturov, seems to have been\nincluded merely for propriety\'s sake in the list of the so-called\nheroes of 1812--the Barclays, Raevskis, Ermolovs, Platovs, and\nMiloradoviches. Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of\nvery limited capacity and information, and like Dokhturov he never\nmade plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most\ndifficult. Since his appointment as general on duty he had always\nslept with his door open, giving orders that every messenger should be\nallowed to wake him up. In battle he was always under fire, so that\nKutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front, and\nlike Dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that, without\nclatter or noise, constitute the most essential part of the machine.\n\nComing out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnitsyn\nfrowned--partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the\nunpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of\ninfluential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,\nespecially Bennigsen, who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers\ndrawn with Kutuzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel,\nissue orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable\nto him though he knew it could not be helped.\n\nAnd in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news,\nimmediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his\nquarters, until Konovnitsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded\nhim that they must go to see his Highness.');

He often\nfell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his\nbed without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.\n\nSo he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred\nhead on his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and\npeering into the darkness.\n\nSince Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more\ninfluence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him,\nKutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his\ntroops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The\nlesson of the Tarutino battle and of the day before it, which\nKutuzov remembered with pain, must, he thought, have some effect on\nothers too.\n\n\"They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.\nPatience and time are my warriors, my champions,\" thought Kutuzov.\nHe knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will\nfall of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled,\nthe tree is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an\nexperienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded, and\nwounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it,\nbut whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided\nquestion. Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barthelemi having been\nsent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kutuzov was almost sure\nthat the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs and it was\nnecessary to wait.\n\n\"They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall\nsee! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!\" thought he. \"What\nfor? Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are\nlike children from whom one can\'t get any sensible account of what has\nhappened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But\nthat\'s not what is needed now.\n\n\"And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to\nthem that when they have thought of two or three contingencies\" (he\nremembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) \"they have\nforeseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.\"\n\nThe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodino\nwas mortal or not had hung over Kutuzov\'s head for a whole month. On\nthe one hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutuzov felt\nassured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and\nall the Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal.\nBut in any case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for\nthem and grew more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed\nduring those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those\nyounger generals for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible\ncontingencies, just like the younger men, but with this difference,\nthat he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and\nbased nothing on them. The longer he thought the more contingencies\npresented themselves. He imagined all sorts of movements of the\nNapoleonic army as a whole or in sections--against Petersburg, or\nagainst him, or to outflank him. He thought too of the possibility\n(which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his\nown weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutuzov even imagined\nthat Napoleon\'s army might turn back through Medyn and Yukhnov, but\nthe one thing he could not foresee was what happened--the insane,\nconvulsive stampede of Napoleon\'s army during its first eleven days\nafter leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what Kutuzov\nhad not yet even dared to think of--the complete extermination of\nthe French. Dorokhov\'s report about Broussier\'s division, the\nguerrillas\' reports of distress in Napoleon\'s army, rumors of\npreparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that\nthe French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were\nonly suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not\nto Kutuzov. With his sixty years\' experience he knew what value to\nattach to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group\nall news so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew\nhow readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary.\nAnd the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe\nit. This question absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to\nhim only life\'s customary routine. To such customary routine\nbelonged his conversations with the staff, the letters he wrote from\nTarutino to Madame de Stael, the reading of novels, the distribution\nof awards, his correspondence with Petersburg, and so on. But the\ndestruction of the French, which he alone foresaw, was his heart\'s one\ndesire.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm\nand thinking of that.\n\nThere was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,\nKonovnitsyn, and Bolkhovitinov.\n\n\"Eh, who\'s there? Come in, come in! What news?\" the field marshal\ncalled out to them.\n\nWhile a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the\nsubstance of the news.\n\n\"Who brought it?\" asked Kutuzov with a look which, when the candle\nwas lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.\n\n\"There can be no doubt about it, your Highness.\"\n\n\"Call him in, call him here.\"\n\nKutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big\npaunch resting against the other which was doubled under him. He\nscrewed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more\ncarefully, as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his\nown mind.\n\n\"Tell me, tell me, friend,\" said he to Bolkhovitinov in his low,\naged voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his\nchest, \"come nearer--nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That\nNapoleon has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?\"\n\nBolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he\nhad been told to report.\n\n\"Speak quicker, quicker! Don\'t torture me!\" Kutuzov interrupted him.\n\nBolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting\ninstructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutuzov\nchecked him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered\nand wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side\nof the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.\n\n\"O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...\" said he in a\ntremulous voice with folded hands. \"Russia is saved. I thank Thee, O\nLord!\" and he wept.');

Dokhturov went to\nMalo-Yaroslavets, but Kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave\norders for the evacuation of Kaluga--a retreat beyond which town\nseemed to him quite possible.\n\nEverywhere Kutuzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for\nhis retreat fled in the opposite direction.\n\nNapoleon\'s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at\nTarutino and Malo-Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what would\nhave happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich\nsouthern provinces.\n\nBut not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from\nadvancing into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did\nnot bar his way), the historians forget that nothing could have\nsaved his army, for then already it bore within itself the germs of\ninevitable ruin. How could that army--which had found abundant\nsupplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of\nkeeping them, and on arriving at Smolensk had looted provisions\ninstead of storing them--how could that army recuperate in Kaluga\nprovince, which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived in\nMoscow, and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set\nablaze?\n\nThat army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodino\nand the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were,\nthe chemical elements of dissolution.\n\nThe members of what had once been an army--Napoleon himself and\nall his soldiers fled--without knowing whither, each concerned only to\nmake his escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the\nhopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.\n\nSo it came about that at the council at Malo-Yaroslavets, when the\ngenerals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all\nmouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier\nMouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing\nneedful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not even\nNapoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all\nrecognized.\n\nBut though they all realized that it was necessary to get away,\nthere still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must\nflee. An external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this\nshock came in due time. It was what the French called \"le hourra de\nl\'Empereur.\"\n\nThe day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode out\nearly in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of\nmarshals and an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and\nthe scene of the previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks\non the prowl for booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly\ncaptured him. If the Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what\nsaved him was the very thing that was destroying the French army,\nthe booty on which the Cossacks fell. Here as at Tarutino they went\nafter plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed\nafter the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape.\n\nWhen les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor\nhimself in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was\nnothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest,\nfamiliar road. Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood\nthat hint, not feeling his former agility and boldness, and under\nthe influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once\nagreed with Mouton and issued orders--as the historians tell us--to\nretreat by the Smolensk road.\n\nThat Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated,\ndoes not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces\nwhich influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk\n(that is, the Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on him also.');

To be able to\ngo a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him\nat the end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a\npromised land to have the strength to move.\n\nThe promised land for the French during their advance had been\nMoscow, during their retreat it was their native land. But that native\nland was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is\nabsolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to\nhimself: \"Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I\nshall rest and spend the night,\" and during the first day\'s journey\nthat resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his\nhopes and desires. And the impulses felt by a single person are always\nmagnified in a crowd.\n\nFor the French retreating along the old Smolensk road, the final\ngoal--their native land--was too remote, and their immediate goal\nwas Smolensk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously\nintensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that\nmuch food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolensk, nor that they\nwere told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon\nhimself, knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this\nalone could give them strength to move on and endure their present\nprivations. So both those who knew and those who did not know deceived\nthemselves, and pushed on to Smolensk as to a promised land.\n\nComing out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising\nenergy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on.\nBesides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French\ninto one mass and supplied them with a certain energy, there was\nanother cause binding them together--their great numbers. As with\nthe physical law of gravity, their enormous mass drew the individual\nhuman atoms to itself. In their hundreds of thousands they moved\nlike a whole nation.\n\nEach of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a\nprisoner to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one\nhand the force of this common attraction to Smolensk, their goal, drew\neach of them in the same direction; on the other hand an army corps\ncould not surrender to a company, and though the French availed\nthemselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to\nsurrender on the slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not\nalways occur. Their very numbers and their crowded and swift\nmovement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only\ndifficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this movement, to\nwhich the French were directing all their energies. Beyond a certain\nlimit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of\ndecomposition.\n\nA lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a\ncertain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt\nthe snow. On the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the\nremaining snow becomes.\n\nOf the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone understood this. When the\nflight of the French army along the Smolensk road became well defined,\nwhat Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of\nOctober began to occur. The superior officers all wanted to\ndistinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to\noverthrow the French, and all clamored for action.\n\nKutuzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited\nin the case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.\n\nHe could not tell them what we say now: \"Why fight, why block the\nroad, losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate\nwretches? What is the use of that, when a third of their army has\nmelted away on the road from Moscow to Vyazma without any battle?\" But\ndrawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand, he told\nthem of the golden bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him,\nflinging themselves on, rending and exulting over the dying beast.\n\nErmolov, Miloradovich, Platov, and others in proximity to the French\nnear Vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up\ntwo French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kutuzov\nthey sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.\n\nAnd try as Kutuzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,\ntrying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to\nthe attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost\nthousands of men.\n\nBut they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,\nclosing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily\nmelting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smolensk.');

An army gains a\nvictory, and at once the rights of the conquering nation have\nincreased to the detriment of the defeated. An army has suffered\ndefeat, and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the\nseverity of the reverse, and if its army suffers a complete defeat the\nnation is quite subjugated.\n\nSo according to history it has been found from the most ancient\ntimes, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon\'s wars serve to\nconfirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army\nAustria loses its rights, and the rights and the strength of France\nincrease. The victories of the French at Jena and Auerstadt destroy\nthe independent existence of Prussia.\n\nBut then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow\nis taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia\nthat ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and\nthen Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of\nhistory: to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the\nhands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles\nthat destroyed Napoleon\'s army, is impossible.\n\nAfter the French victory at Borodino there was no general engagement\nnor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist.\nWhat does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of\nChina, we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is\nthe historians\' usual expedient when anything does not fit their\nstandards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which\nonly a small number of troops took part, we might treat it as an\nexception; but this event occurred before our fathers\' eyes, and for\nthem it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland, and\nit happened in the greatest of all known wars.\n\nThe period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodino to\nthe expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does\nnot produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of\nconquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples\nlies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in\nsomething else.\n\nThe French historians, describing the condition of the French army\nbefore it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,\nexcept the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport--there was no\nforage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one\ncould remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather\nthan let the French have it.\n\nThe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the\npeasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow\ndrove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally\nfailed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable\nmultitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for\nthe high price offered them, but burned it instead.\n\nLet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with\nrapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The\nfencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants,\nfeeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke\nbut concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first\ncudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine\nthat the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest\nmeans to attain his end was at the same time influenced by\ntraditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case,\ninsisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to\nall the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity\nwould result from such an account of the duel.\n\nThe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of\nfencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier\nand snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to\nexplain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the\nhistorians who have described the event.\n\nAfter the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow any\nprevious traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the\nretreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodino and the renewed\nretreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the\nseizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures\nfrom the rules.\n\nNapoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing\nattitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent\'s rapier saw a cudgel\nraised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutuzov and\nto the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to\nall the rules--as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite\nof the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the\nrules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it\nseemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to\nassume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and\nto make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on--the cudgel of the\npeople\'s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength,\nand without consulting anyone\'s tastes or rules and regardless of\nanything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but\nconsistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had\nperished.\n\nAnd it is well for a people who do not--as the French did in 1813--salute\naccording to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their\nrapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,\nbut at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have adopted\nin similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to\nhand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in\ntheir soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.');

Such action always occurs in wars that\ntake on a national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds\nopposing each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when\nattacked by stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers.\nThis was done by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in\nthe Caucasus, and by the Russians in 1812.\n\nPeople have called this kind of war \"guerrilla warfare\" and assume\nthat by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a\nwar does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a\nwell-known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That\nrule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to\nbe stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict.\n\nGuerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly\ninfringes that rule.\n\nThis contradiction arises from the fact that military science\nassumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers.\nMilitary science says that the more troops the greater the strength.\nLes gros bataillons ont toujours raison.*\n\n\n*Large battalions are always victorious.\n\n\nFor military science to say this is like defining momentum in\nmechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are\nequal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved\nare equal or unequal.\n\nMomentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.\n\nIn military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its\nmass and some unknown x.\n\nMilitary science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the\nfact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and\nthat small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the\nexistence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it--now in a\ngeometric formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most\nusually, in the genius of the commanders. But the assignment of\nthese various meanings to the factor does not yield results which\naccord with the historic facts.\n\nYet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to\ngratify the \"heroes\") of the efficacy of the directions issued in\nwartime by commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.\n\nThat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the\ngreater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the\nmen composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are\nnot, fighting under the command of a genius, in two--or three-line\nformation, with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a\nminute. Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most\nadvantageous conditions for fighting.\n\nThe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass\ngives the resulting force. To define and express the significance of\nthis unknown factor--the spirit of an army--is a problem for science.\n\nThis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to\nsubstitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that\nforce becomes apparent--such as the commands of the general, the\nequipment employed, and so on--mistaking these for the real\nsignificance of the factor, and if we recognize this unknown\nquantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to\nfight and to face danger. Only then, expressing known historic facts\nby equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor,\ncan we hope to define the unknown.\n\nTen men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions,\nor divisions, conquer--that is, kill or take captive--all the\nothers, while themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and\non the other fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to\nthe fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This\nequation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us\na ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected\nhistoric units (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such\nequations, a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws\nshould exist and might be discovered.\n\nThe tactical rule that an army should act in masses when\nattacking, and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms\nthe truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To\nlead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by\nmovement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But\nthis rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army\ncontinually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking\ncontrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of\nthe troops occurs, as in all national wars.\n\nThe French, retreating in 1812--though according to tactics they should\nhave separated into detachments to defend themselves--congregated into a\nmass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass\nheld the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according\nto tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up into\nsmall units, because their spirit had so risen that separate\nindividuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing\nany compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and\ndangers.');

Denis\nDavydov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the\nvalue of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of\nmilitary science destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit\nfor taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare.\n\nOn August 24 Davydov\'s first partisan detachment was formed and then\nothers were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more\nnumerous these detachments became.\n\nThe irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the\nfallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree--the\nFrench army--and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when\nthe French were fleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds of such\ncompanies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that\nadopted all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and\nthe comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry.\nThere were also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of\npeasants and landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded\none party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a\nmonth; and there was Vasilisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew\nhundreds of the French.\n\nThe partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of\nOctober. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,\namazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded and\ncaptured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,\nhardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the\nend of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had\nbecome clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what\ncould not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and\nmoving according to rules at a distance from the French, still\nregarded many things as impossible. The small bands that had started\ntheir activities long before and had already observed the French\nclosely considered things possible which the commanders of the big\ndetachments did not dare to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who\ncrept in among the French now considered everything possible.\n\nOn October 22, Denisov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his\ngroup at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning\nhe and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been\nwatching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French\nconvoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the\nrest of the army, which--as was learned from spies and prisoners--was\nmoving under a strong escort to Smolensk. Besides Denisov and Dolokhov\n(who also led a small party and moved in Denisov\'s vicinity), the\ncommanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this\nconvoy and, as Denisov expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for\nit. Two of the commanders of large parties--one a Pole and the other a\nGerman--sent invitations to Denisov almost simultaneously, requesting\nhim to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy.\n\n\"No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,\" said Denisov on\nreading these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite\nhis heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general,\nhe had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command\nof the Polish general. To the Polish general he replied to the same\neffect, informing him that he was already under the command of the\nGerman.\n\nHaving arranged matters thus, Denisov and Dolokhov intended, without\nreporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that\nconvoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from\nthe village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo. To the left of the road\nbetween Mikulino and Shamshevo there were large forests, extending in\nsome places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back\nfrom it. Through these forests Denisov and his party rode all day,\nsometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very\nedge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,\nCossacks of Denisov\'s party had seized and carried off into the forest\ntwo wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not\nfar from Mikulino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,\nand until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French\nwithout attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Shamshevo\nquietly without alarming them and then, after joining Dolokhov who was\nto come that evening to a consultation at a watchman\'s hut in the\nforest less than a mile from Shamshevo, to surprise the French at\ndawn, falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and\nrout and capture them all at one blow.\n\nIn their rear, more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest\ncame right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any\nfresh columns of French should show themselves.\n\nBeyond Shamshevo, Dolokhov was to observe the road in the same\nway, to find out at what distance there were other French troops. They\nreckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denisov had two\nhundred, and Dolokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of\nnumbers did not deter Denisov. All that he now wanted to know was what\ntroops these were and to learn that he had to capture a \"tongue\"--that\nis, a man from the enemy column. That morning\'s attack on the wagons\nhad been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all\nbeen killed; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he\nwas a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops\nin that column.\n\nDenisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear\nof putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tikhon\nShcherbaty, a peasant of his party, to Shamshevo to try and seize at\nleast one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on in\nadvance.');

The sky and the horizon were both\nthe color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and\nthen suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.\n\nDenisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain\nran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides.\nLike his horse, which turned its head and laid its ears back, he\nshrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him. His\nthin face with its short, thick black beard looked angry.\n\nBeside Denisov rode an esaul,* Denisov\'s fellow worker, also in felt\ncloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.\n\n\n*A captain of Cossacks.\n\n\nEsaul Lovayski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,\npale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm\nself-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to\nsay in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first\nglance at the esaul and Denisov one saw that the latter was wet and\nuncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the\nesaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always\nand that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was\none with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold\nstrength.\n\nA little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and\nwearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.\n\nA little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghiz mount with an\nenormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a\nblue French overcoat.\n\nBeside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform\nand blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on\nto the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed\nabout him with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that\nmorning.\n\nBehind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars\nin threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in\nFrench greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The\nhorses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether\nchestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes,\nlooked strangely thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles,\nreins, were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the\nfallen leaves that strewed the road. The men sat huddled up trying not\nto stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and\nnot admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their\nseats, their knees, and at the back of their necks. In the midst of\nthe outspread line of Cossacks two wagons, drawn by French horses\nand by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front,\nrumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the\nwater that lay in the ruts.\n\nDenisov\'s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and\nbumped his rider\'s knee against a tree.\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" exclaimed Denisov angrily, and showing his teeth he\nstruck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and\nhis comrades with mud.\n\nDenisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from\nhunger (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more\nbecause he still had no news from Dolokhov and the man sent to capture\na \"tongue\" had not returned.\n\n\"There\'ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as\ntoday. It\'s too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it\noff till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will\nsnatch the prey from under our noses,\" thought Denisov, continually\npeering forward, hoping to see a messenger from Dolokhov.\n\nOn coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to\nthe right, Denisov stopped.\n\n\"There\'s someone coming,\" said he.\n\nThe esaul looked in the direction Denisov indicated.\n\n\"There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not\npresupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,\" said the\nesaul, who was fond of using words the Cossacks did not know.\n\nThe approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer\nvisible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary\ngallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and\ndrenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,\nstanding in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young\nlad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denisov\nand handed him a sodden envelope.\n\n\"From the general,\" said the officer. \"Please excuse its not being\nquite dry.\"\n\nDenisov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.\n\n\"There, they kept telling us: \'It\'s dangerous, it\'s dangerous,\'\"\nsaid the officer, addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading the\ndispatch. \"But Komarov and I\"--he pointed to the Cossack--\"were\nprepared. We have each of us two pistols.... But what\'s this?\" he\nasked, noticing the French drummer boy. \"A prisoner? You\'ve already\nbeen in action? May I speak to him?\"\n\n\"Wostov! Petya!\" exclaimed Denisov, having run through the dispatch.\n\"Why didn\'t you say who you were?\" and turning with a smile he held\nout his hand to the lad.\n\nThe officer was Petya Rostov.\n\nAll the way Petya had been preparing himself to behave with\nDenisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer--without hinting at\ntheir previous acquaintance. But as soon as Denisov smiled at him\nPetya brightened up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner\nhe had been rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already\nbeen in a battle near Vyazma and how a certain hussar had\ndistinguished himself there.\n\n\"Well, I am glad to see you,\" Denisov interrupted him, and his\nface again assumed its anxious expression.\n\n\"Michael Feoklitych,\" said he to the esaul, \"this is again fwom that\nGerman, you know. He\"--he indicated Petya--\"is serving under him.\"\n\nAnd Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a\nrepetition of the German general\'s demand that he should join forces\nwith him for an attack on the transport.\n\n\"If we don\'t take it tomowwow, he\'ll snatch it fwom under our\nnoses,\" he added.\n\nWhile Denisov was talking to the esaul, Petya--abashed by\nDenisov\'s cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition\nof his trousers--furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat\nso that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air\nas possible.\n\n\"Will there be any orders, your honor?\" he asked Denisov, holding\nhis hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general\nfor which he had prepared himself, \"or shall I remain with your\nhonor?\"\n\n\"Orders?\" Denisov repeated thoughtfully. \"But can you stay till\ntomowwow?\"\n\n\"Oh, please... May I stay with you?\" cried Petya.\n\n\"But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?\"\nasked Denisov.\n\nPetya blushed.\n\n\"He gave me no instructions. I think I could?\" he returned,\ninquiringly.\n\n\"Well, all wight,\" said Denisov.\n\nAnd turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting\nplace arranged near the watchman\'s hut in the forest, and told the\nofficer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant)\nto go and find out where Dolokhov was and whether he would come that\nevening. Denisov himself intended going with the esaul and Petya to\nthe edge of the forest where it reached out to Shamshevo, to have a\nlook at the part of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.\n\n\"Well, old fellow,\" said he to the peasant guide, \"lead us to\nShamshevo.\"\n\nDenisov, Petya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and\nthe hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to\nthe edge of the forest.');

Denisov, the esaul, and Petya rode silently, following\nthe peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned\ntoes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet\nleaves, silently led them to the edge of the forest.\n\nHe ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to\nwhere the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree\nthat had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously\nto them with his hand.\n\nDenisov and Petya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant\nwas standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest,\non a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a\nsteep ravine, was a small village and a landowner\'s house with a\nbroken roof. In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well,\nby the pond, over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill\nfrom the bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred\nyards away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist.\nTheir un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining\nuphill with the carts, and their calls to one another, could be\nclearly heard.\n\n\"Bwing the prisoner here,\" said Denisov in a low voice, not taking\nhis eyes off the French.\n\nA Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to\nDenisov. Pointing to the French troops, Denisov asked him what these\nand those of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his\npockets and lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denisov in affright, but\nin spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused\nanswers, merely assenting to everything Denisov asked him. Denisov\nturned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his\nown conjectures to him.\n\nPetya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy,\nnow at Denisov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village\nand along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.\n\n\"Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?\" said\nDenisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes.\n\n\"It is a very suitable spot,\" said the esaul.\n\n\"We\'ll send the infantwy down by the swamps,\" Denisov continued.\n\"They\'ll cweep up to the garden; you\'ll wide up fwom there with the\nCossacks\"--he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village--\"and\nI with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...\"\n\n\"The hollow is impassable--there\'s a swamp there,\" said the esaul.\n\"The horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....\"\n\nWhile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded\nfrom the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared,\nthen another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French\nvoices shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment\nDenisov and the esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought\nthey were the cause of the firing and shouting. But the firing and\nshouting did not relate to them. Down below, a man wearing something\nred was running through the marsh. The French were evidently firing\nand shouting at him.\n\n\"Why, that\'s our Tikhon,\" said the esaul.\n\n\"So it is! It is!\"\n\n\"The wascal!\" said Denisov.\n\n\"He\'ll get away!\" said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.\n\nThe man whom they called Tikhon, having run to the stream, plunged\nin so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared\nfor an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet,\nand ran on. The French who had been pursuing him stopped.\n\n\"Smart, that!\" said the esaul.\n\n\"What a beast!\" said Denisov with his former look of vexation. \"What\nhas he been doing all this time?\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" asked Petya.\n\n\"He\'s our plastun. I sent him to capture a \'tongue.\'\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Petya, nodding at the first words Denisov uttered as\nif he understood it all, though he really did not understand\nanything of it.\n\nTikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their\nband. He was a peasant from Pokrovsk, near the river Gzhat. When\nDenisov had come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and\nhad as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew\nabout the French, the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied,\nas all village elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything\nof them. But when Denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the\nFrench, and asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied\nthat some \"more-orderers\" had really been at their village, but that\nTikhon Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters.\nDenisov had Tikhon called and, having praised him for his activity,\nsaid a few words in the elder\'s presence about loyalty to the Tsar and\nthe country and the hatred of the French that all sons of the\nfatherland should cherish.\n\n\"We don\'t do the French any harm,\" said Tikhon, evidently frightened\nby Denisov\'s words. \"We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you\nknow! We killed a score or so of \'more-orderers,\' but we did no harm\nelse...\"\n\nNext day when Denisov had left Pokrovsk, having quite forgotten\nabout this peasant, it was reported to him that Tikhon had attached\nhimself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it.\nDenisov gave orders to let him do so.\n\nTikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching\nwater, flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking\nand aptitude for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for\nbooty and always brought back French clothing and weapons, and when\ntold to would bring in French captives also. Denisov then relieved him\nfrom drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on\nexpeditions and had him enrolled among the Cossacks.\n\nTikhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging\nbehind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried\nrather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf\nuses its teeth, with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or\ncrunching thick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs\nwith blows at arm\'s length, or holding the head of the ax would cut\nthin little pegs or carve spoons. In Denisov\'s party he held a\npeculiar and exceptional position. When anything particularly\ndifficult or nasty had to be done--to push a cart out of the mud\nwith one\'s shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail, skin\nit, slink in among the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a\nday--everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon.\n\n\"It won\'t hurt that devil--he\'s as strong as a horse!\" they said\nof him.\n\nOnce a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him\nand shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which Tikhon\ntreated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the\nsubject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment--jokes in which\nTikhon readily joined.\n\n\"Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?\" the Cossacks would\nbanter him. And Tikhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended\nto be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only\neffect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he\nseldom brought in prisoners.\n\nHe was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found\nmore opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more\nFrenchmen, and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the\nCossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been\nsent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a \"tongue.\" But\nwhether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman\nor because he had slept through the night, he had crept by day into\nsome bushes right among the French and, as Denisov had witnessed\nfrom above, had been detected by them.');

Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,\nwearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan hat, was approaching\nwith long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax\nstuck in his girdle. When he espied Denisov he hastily threw something\ninto the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and\napproached his commander. It was Tikhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked\nface and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He\nlifted his head high and gazed at Denisov as if repressing a laugh.\n\n\"Well, where did you disappear to?\" inquired Denisov.\n\n\"Where did I disappear to?

So I went for them with my ax, this way: \'What are\nyou up to?\' says I. \'Christ be with you!\'\" shouted Tikhon, waving\nhis arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest.\n\n\"Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the\npuddles!\" said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.\n\nPetya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained\nfrom laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon\'s face to the\nesaul\'s and Denisov\'s, unable to make out what it all meant.\n\n\"Don\'t play the fool!\" said Denisov, coughing angrily. \"Why didn\'t\nyou bwing the first one?\"\n\nTikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,\nthen suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,\ndisclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called\nShcherbaty--the gap-toothed). Denisov smiled, and Petya burst into a\npeal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined.\n\n\"Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,\" said Tikhon. \"The\nclothes on him--poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your\nhonor! Why, he says: \'I\'m a general\'s son myself, I won\'t go!\' he\nsays.\"\n\n\"You are a bwute!\" said Denisov. \"I wanted to question...\"\n\n\"But I questioned him,\" said Tikhon. \"He said he didn\'t know much.\n\'There are a lot of us,\' he says, \'but all poor stuff--only soldiers\nin name,\' he says. \'Shout loud at them,\' he says, \'and you\'ll take\nthem all,\'\" Tikhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into\nDenisov\'s eyes.\n\n\"I\'ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes--that\'ll teach you to play the\nfool!\" said Denisov severely.\n\n\"But why are you angry?\" remonstrated Tikhon, \"just as if I\'d\nnever seen your Frenchmen!

From the time he received his\ncommission, and especially since he had joined the active army and\ntaken part in the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in a constant state\nof blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic\nhurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was\nhighly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army, but\nat the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic\nexploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be.\nAnd he was always in a hurry to get where he was not.\n\nWhen on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish\nto send somebody to Denisov\'s detachment, Petya begged so piteously to\nbe sent that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he\nrecalled Petya\'s mad action at the battle of Vyazma, where instead\nof riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had\ngalloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had\nthere twice fired his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade\nhis taking part in any action whatever of Denisov\'s. That was why\nPetya had blushed and grown confused when Denisov asked him whether he\ncould stay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest\nPetya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and\nreturn at once. But when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and\nlearned that there would certainly be an attack that night, he\ndecided, with the rapidity with which young people change their views,\nthat the general, whom he had greatly respected till then, was a\nrubbishy German, that Denisov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and Tikhon\na hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a\nmoment of difficulty.\n\nIt was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and the esaul\nrode up to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be\nseen, and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the\nglade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest\nwhere the French could not see the smoke. In the passage of the\nsmall watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some\nmutton. In the room three officers of Denisov\'s band were converting a\ndoor into a tabletop. Petya took off his wet clothes, gave them to\nbe dried, and at once began helping the officers to fix up the\ndinner table.\n\nIn ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the\ntable were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.\n\nSitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton\nwith his hands, down which the grease trickled, Petya was in an\necstatic childish state of love for all men, and consequently of\nconfidence that others loved him in the same way.\n\n\"So then what do you think, Vasili Dmitrich?\" said he to Denisov.\n\"It\'s all right my staying a day with you?\" And not waiting for a\nreply he answered his own question: \"You see I was told to find\nout--well, I am finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into\nthe chief... I don\'t want a reward... But I want...\"\n\nPetya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head\nand flourishing his arms.\n\n\"Into the vewy chief...\" Denisov repeated with a smile.\n\n\"Only, please let me command something, so that I may really\ncommand...\" Petya went on. \"What would it be to you?... Oh, you want a\nknife?\" he said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a\npiece of mutton.\n\nAnd he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.\n\n\"Please keep it. I have several like it,\" said Petya, blushing.\n\"Heavens! I was quite forgetting!\" he suddenly cried. \"I have some\nraisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler\nand he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to\nsomething sweet. Would you like some?...\" and Petya ran out into the\npassage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained\nabout five pounds of raisins. \"Have some, gentlemen, have some!\"\n\n\"You want a coffeepot, don\'t you?\" he asked the esaul. \"I bought a\ncapital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he\'s very\nhonest, that\'s the chief thing. I\'ll be sure to send it to you. Or\nperhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out--that happens\nsometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are\"--and\nhe showed a bag--\"a hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please\ntake as many as you want, or all if you like....\"\n\nThen suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Petya stopped and\nblushed.\n\nHe tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that\nwas foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered\nthe French drummer boy. \"It\'s capital for us here, but what of him?\nWhere have they put him? Have they fed him? Haven\'t they hurt his\nfeelings?\" he thought. But having caught himself saying too much about\nthe flints, he was now afraid to speak out.\n\n\"I might ask,\" he thought, \"but they\'ll say: \'He\'s a boy himself and\nso he pities the boy.\' I\'ll show them tomorrow whether I\'m a boy. Will\nit seem odd if I ask?\" Petya thought. \"Well, never mind!\" and\nimmediately, blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see\nif they appeared ironical, he said:\n\n\"May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him\nsomething to eat?... Perhaps...\"\n\n\"Yes, he\'s a poor little fellow,\" said Denisov, who evidently saw\nnothing shameful in this reminder. \"Call him in. His name is Vincent\nBosse. Have him fetched.\"\n\n\"I\'ll call him,\" said Petya.\n\n\"Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,\" Denisov repeated.\n\nPetya was standing at the door when Denisov said this. He slipped in\nbetween the officers, came close to Denisov, and said:\n\n\"Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!\"\n\nAnd having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut.\n\n\"Bosse! Vincent!\" Petya cried, stopping outside the door.\n\n\"Who do you want, sir?\" asked a voice in the darkness.\n\nPetya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured\nthat day.\n\n\"Ah, Vesenny?\" said a Cossack.\n\nVincent, the boy\'s name, had already been changed by the Cossacks\ninto Vesenny (vernal) and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers.\nIn both these adaptations the reference to spring (vesna) matched\nthe impression made by the young lad.\n\n\"He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesenya!\nVesenya!--Vesenny!\" laughing voices were heard calling to one\nanother in the darkness.\n\n\"He\'s a smart lad,\" said an hussar standing near Petya. \"We gave him\nsomething to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!\"\n\nThe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the\ndarkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.\n\n\"Ah, c\'est vous!\" said Petya. \"Voulez-vous manger? N\'ayez pas\npeur, on ne vous fera pas de mal,\"* he added shyly and affectionately,\ntouching the boy\'s hand. \"Entrez, entrez.\"*[2]\n\n\n*\"Ah, it\'s you! Do you want something to eat? Don\'t be afraid,\nthey won\'t hurt you.\"\n\n*[2] \"Come in, come in.\"\n\n\n\"Merci, monsieur,\"* said the drummer boy in a trembling almost\nchildish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.\n\n\n*\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\nThere were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but\ndid not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then\nin the darkness he took the boy\'s hand and pressed it.\n\n\"Come in, come in!\" he repeated in a gentle whisper. \"Oh, what can I\ndo for him?\" he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in\nfirst.\n\nWhen the boy had entered the hut, Petya sat down at a distance\nfrom him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to\nhim. But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it\nwould seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.');

Petya\nhad heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov\'s extraordinary bravery\nand of his cruelty to the French, so from the moment he entered the\nhut Petya did not take his eyes from him, but braced himself up more\nand more and held his head high, that he might not be unworthy even of\nsuch company.\n\nDolokhov\'s appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity.\n\nDenisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas\nthe Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and\neverything he did indicated his unusual position. But Dolokhov, who in\nMoscow had worn a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most\ncorrect officer of the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a\nGuardsman\'s padded coat with an Order of St. George at his\nbuttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head. He took\noff his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and without greeting\nanyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter\nin hand. Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had\non the transport, of the message Petya had brought, and his own\nreplies to both generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French\ndetachment.\n\n\"That\'s so. But we must know what troops they are and their\nnumbers,\" said Dolokhov. \"It will be necessary to go there. We can\'t\nstart the affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I\nlike to work accurately. Here now--wouldn\'t one of these gentlemen\nlike to ride over to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare\nuniform.\"\n\n\"I, I... I\'ll go with you!\" cried Petya.\n\n\"There\'s no need for you to go at all,\" said Denisov, addressing\nDolokhov, \"and as for him, I won\'t let him go on any account.\"\n\n\"I like that!\" exclaimed Petya. \"Why shouldn\'t I go?\"\n\n\"Because it\'s useless.\"\n\n\"Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and\nthat\'s all. You\'ll take me, won\'t you?\" he said, turning to Dolokhov.\n\n\"Why not?\" Dolokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of\nthe French drummer boy. \"Have you had that youngster with you long?\"\nhe asked Denisov.\n\n\"He was taken today but he knows nothing. I\'m keeping him with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, and where do you put the others?\" inquired Dolokhov.\n\n\"Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,\" shouted\nDenisov, suddenly flushing. \"And I say boldly that I have not a single\nman\'s life on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send\nthirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of\nstaining--I speak bluntly--staining the honor of a soldier?\"\n\n\"That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count\nof sixteen,\" said Dolokhov with cold irony, \"but it\'s time for you\nto drop it.\"\n\n\"Why, I\'ve not said anything! I only say that I\'ll certainly go with\nyou,\" said Petya shyly.\n\n\"But for you and me, old fellow, it\'s time to drop these amenities,\"\ncontinued Dolokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking\nof this subject which irritated Denisov. \"Now, why have you kept\nthis lad?\" he went on, swaying his head. \"Because you are sorry for\nhim! Don\'t we know those \'receipts\' of yours? You send a hundred men\naway, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So\nisn\'t it all the same not to send them?\"\n\nThe esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.\n\n\"That\'s not the point. I\'m not going to discuss the matter. I do not\nwish to take it on my conscience. You say they\'ll die. All wight. Only\nnot by my fault!\"\n\nDolokhov began laughing.\n\n\"Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if\nthey did catch me they\'d string me up to an aspen tree, and with all\nyour chivalry just the same.\" He paused. \"However, we must get to\nwork. Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms\nin it. Well, are you coming with me?\" he asked Petya.\n\n\"I? Yes, yes, certainly!\" cried Petya, blushing almost to tears\nand glancing at Denisov.\n\nWhile Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done\nwith prisoners, Petya had once more felt awkward and restless; but\nagain he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about.\n\"If grown-up, distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and\nright,\" thought he. \"But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine\nthat I\'ll obey him and that he can order me about. I will certainly go\nto the French camp with Dolokhov. If he can, so can I!\"\n\nAnd to all Denisov\'s persuasions, Petya replied that he too was\naccustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that\nhe never considered personal danger.\n\n\"For you\'ll admit that if we don\'t know for sure how many of them\nthere are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are\nonly two of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go,\nso don\'t hinder me,\" said he. \"It will only make things worse...\"');

On reaching the bottom, Dolokhov told the Cossacks\naccompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot\nalong the road to the bridge. Petya, his heart in his mouth with\nexcitement, rode by his side.\n\n\"If we\'re caught, I won\'t be taken alive! I have a pistol,\"\nwhispered he.\n\n\"Don\'t talk Russian,\" said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper, and at\nthat very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: \"Qui\nvive?\"* and the click of a musket.\n\n\n*\"Who goes there?\"\n\n\nThe blood rushed to Petya\'s face and he grasped his pistol.\n\n\"Lanciers du 6-me,\"* replied Dolokhov, neither hastening nor\nslackening his horse\'s pace.\n\n\n*\"Lancers of the 6th Regiment.\"\n\n\nThe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.\n\n\"Mot d\'ordre.\"*\n\n\n*\"Password.\"\n\n\nDolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.\n\n\"Dites donc, le colonel Gerard est ici?\"* he asked.\n\n\n*\"Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?\"\n\n\n\"Mot d\'ordre,\" repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not\nreplying.\n\n\"Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas\nle mot d\'ordre...\" cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding\nstraight at the sentinel. \"Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.\"*\n\n\n*\"When an officer is making his round, sentinels don\'t ask him for\nthe password.... I am asking you if the colonel is here.\"\n\n\nAnd without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped\naside, Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk.\n\nNoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dolokhov\nstopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The\nman, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up\nto Dolokhov\'s horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply\nand in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were\nhigher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he\ncalled the landowner\'s house.\n\nHaving ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk\ncould be heard around the campfires, Dolokhov turned into the\ncourtyard of the landowner\'s house. Having ridden in, he dismounted\nand approached a big blazing campfire, around which sat several men\ntalking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge\nof the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by\nthe fire, was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.\n\n\"Oh, he\'s a hard nut to crack,\" said one of the officers who was\nsitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire.\n\n\"He\'ll make them get a move on, those fellows!\" said another,\nlaughing.\n\nBoth fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of\nDolokhov\'s and Petya\'s steps as they advanced to the fire leading\ntheir horses.\n\n\"Bonjour, messieurs!\"* said Dolokhov loudly and clearly.\n\n\n*\"Good day, gentlemen.\"\n\n\nThere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,\nand one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up\nto Dolokhov.\n\n\"Is that you, Clement?\" he asked. \"Where the devil...?\" But, noticing\nhis mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dolokhov as\na stranger, asking what he could do for him.\n\nDolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake\ntheir regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether\nthey knew anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything,\nand Petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and\nDolokhov with hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were\nsilent.\n\n\"If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too\nlate,\" said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.\n\nDolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on\nfarther that night.\n\nHe handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot\nand squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the\nlong neck. That officer did not take his eyes from Dolokhov and\nagain asked to what regiment he belonged. Dolokhov, as if he had not\nheard the question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe\nwhich he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far\nthe road before them was safe from Cossacks.\n\n\"Those brigands are everywhere,\" replied an officer from behind\nthe fire.\n\nDolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers\nsuch as his companion and himself, \"but probably they would not dare\nto attack large detachments?\" he added inquiringly. No one replied.\n\n\"Well, now he\'ll come away,\" Petya thought every moment as he\nstood by the campfire listening to the talk.\n\nBut Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and\nbegan putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the\nbattalion, how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about\nthe Russian prisoners with that detachment, Dolokhov said:\n\n\"A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would\nbe better to shoot such rabble,\" and burst into loud laughter, so\nstrange that Petya thought the French would immediately detect their\ndisguise, and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.\n\nNo one replied a word to Dolokhov\'s laughter, and a French officer\nwhom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and\nwhispered something to a companion. Dolokhov got up and called to\nthe soldier who was holding their horses.\n\n\"Will they bring our horses or not?\" thought Petya, instinctively\ndrawing nearer to Dolokhov.\n\nThe horses were brought.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" said Dolokhov.\n\nPetya wished to say \"Good night\" but could not utter a word. The\nofficers were whispering together. Dolokhov was a long time mounting\nhis horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at\na footpace. Petya rode beside him, longing to look round to see\nwhether or not the French were running after them, but not daring to.\n\nComing out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the\nopen country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and\nlistened. \"Do you hear?\" he asked. Petya recognized the sound of\nRussian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round\ntheir campfires. When they had descended to the bridge Petya and\nDolokhov rode past the sentinel, who without saying a word paced\nmorosely up and down it, then they descended into the hollow where the\nCossacks awaited them.\n\n\"Well now, good-by. Tell Denisov, \'at the first shot at\ndaybreak,\'\" said Dolokhov and was about to ride away, but Petya seized\nhold of him.\n\n\"Really!\" he cried, \"you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how\nsplendid! How I love you!\"\n\n\"All right, all right!\" said Dolokhov. But Petya did not let go of\nhim and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward\nhim and wanted to kiss him.

Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can\nstill get a nap before morning.\"\n\n\"But... no,\" said Petya, \"I don\'t want to sleep yet. Besides I\nknow myself, if I fall asleep it\'s finished. And then I am used to not\nsleeping before a battle.\"\n\nHe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his\nexpedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next\nday.\n\nThen, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he rose and went out of\ndoors.\n\nIt was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were\nstill falling from the trees. Near the watchman\'s hut the black shapes\nof the Cossacks\' shanties and of horses tethered together could be\nseen. Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their\nhorses beside them were discernible, and in the hollow the dying\ncampfire gleamed red. Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep;\nhere and there, amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of\nthe horses near by, could be heard low voices which seemed to be\nwhispering.\n\nPetya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.\nSomeone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses\nmunching their oats. In the dark Petya recognized his own horse, which\nhe called \"Karabakh\" though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to\nit.\n\n\"Well, Karabakh! We\'ll do some service tomorrow,\" said he,\nsniffing its nostrils and kissing it.\n\n\"Why aren\'t you asleep, sir?\" said a Cossack who was sitting under a\nwagon.\n\n\"No, ah... Likhachev--isn\'t that your name? Do you know I have\nonly just come back! We\'ve been into the French camp.\"\n\nAnd Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride\nbut also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his\nlife than to act \"just anyhow.\"\n\n\"Well, you should get some sleep now,\" said the Cossack.\n\n\"No, I am used to this,\" said Petya. \"I say, aren\'t the flints in\nyour pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don\'t you want any? You\ncan have some.\"\n\nThe Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look\nat Petya.\n\n\"Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,\" said\nPetya. \"Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and\nthen they\'re sorry for it afterwards. I don\'t like that.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the Cossack.\n\n\"Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen\nmy saber for me? It\'s got bl...\" (Petya feared to tell a lie, and\nthe saber never had been sharpened.) \"Can you do it?\"\n\n\"Of course I can.\"\n\nLikhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Petya heard the\nwarlike sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat\non its edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.\n\n\"I say! Are the lads asleep?\" asked Petya.\n\n\"Some are, and some aren\'t--like us.\"\n\n\"Well, and that boy?\"\n\n\"Vesenny? Oh, he\'s thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast\nasleep after his fright. He was that glad!\"\n\nAfter that Petya remained silent for a long time, listening to the\nsounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure\nappeared.\n\n\"What are you sharpening?\" asked a man coming up to the wagon.\n\n\"Why, this gentleman\'s saber.\"\n\n\"That\'s right,\" said the man, whom Petya took to be an hussar.\n\"Was the cup left here?\"\n\n\"There, by the wheel!\"\n\nThe hussar took the cup.\n\n\"It must be daylight soon,\" said he, yawning, and went away.\n\nPetya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov\'s\nguerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon\ncaptured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under\nit Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark\nblotch to the right was the watchman\'s hut, and the red blotch below\nto the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had\ncome for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew\nnor waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom\nwhere nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be\nthe watchman\'s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very\ndepths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be\nthe eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a\nwagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon\nbut on a terribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have\nto fall for a whole day or a whole month, or go on falling and never\nreach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhachev, who\nwas sitting under the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest,\nmost wonderful, most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of.\nIt might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back\ninto the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished--disappeared\naltogether and dissolved into nothingness.\n\nNothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was\nin a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.\n\nHe looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the\nearth. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were\nswiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if\nthe clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes\nit seemed as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed\nto be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low\nthat one could touch it with one\'s hand.\n\nPetya\'s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.\n\nThe trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed\nand jostled one another. Someone snored.\n\n\"Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...\" hissed the saber against the whetstone,\nand suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,\nsweetly solemn hymn. Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than\nNicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the\nmelody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly\nfresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The\nmelody grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was\nplayed was a fugue--though Petya had not the least conception of what\na fugue is. Each instrument--now resembling a violin and now a horn,\nbut better and clearer than violin or horn--played its own part, and\nbefore it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that\nbegan almost the same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and\nthey all blended into one and again became separate and again blended,\nnow into solemn church music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant\nand triumphant.\n\n\"Oh--why, that was in a dream!\" Petya said to himself, as he lurched\nforward. \"It\'s in my ears. But perhaps it\'s music of my own. Well,\ngo on, my music! Now!...\"\n\nHe closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance,\nsounds fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again\nall mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. \"Oh, this is\ndelightful! As much as I like and as I like!\" said Petya to himself.\nHe tried to conduct that enormous orchestra.\n\n\"Now softly, softly die away!\" and the sounds obeyed him. \"Now\nfuller, more joyful. Still more and more joyful!\" And from an\nunknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds. \"Now voices join\nin!\" ordered Petya. And at first from afar he heard men\'s voices and\nthen women\'s. The voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and\nPetya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy.\n\nWith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from\nthe trees, and the hissing of the saber, \"Ozheg-zheg-zheg...\" and\nagain the horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the\nchoir but joining in it.\n\nPetya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all\nthe time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no\none to share it. He was awakened by Likhachev\'s kindly voice.\n\n\"It\'s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!\"\n\nPetya woke up.\n\n\"It\'s getting light, it\'s really getting light!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to\ntheir very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare\nbranches. Petya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket\nand gave it to Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and\nsheathed it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening\ntheir saddle girths.\n\n\"And here\'s the commander,\" said Likhachev.\n\nDenisov came out of the watchman\'s hut and, having called Petya,\ngave orders to get ready.');

The infantry of the\ndetachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the\ntrees in the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through\nthe mud. The esaul gave some orders to his men. Petya held his horse\nby the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face,\nhaving been bathed in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were\nparticularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down his spine and his\nwhole body pulsed rhythmically.\n\n\"Well, is ev\'wything weady?\" asked Denisov. \"Bwing the horses.\"\n\nThe horses were brought. Denisov was angry with the Cossack\nbecause the saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted.\nPetya put his foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to\nnip his leg, but Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of\nhis own weight and, turning to look at the hussars starting in the\ndarkness behind him, rode up to Denisov.\n\n\"Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for\nGod\'s sake...!\" said he.\n\nDenisov seemed to have forgotten Petya\'s very existence. He turned\nto glance at him.\n\n\"I ask one thing of you,\" he said sternly, \"to obey me and not shove\nyourself forward anywhere.\"\n\nHe did not say another word to Petya but rode in silence all the\nway. When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably\ngrowing light over the field. Denisov talked in whispers with the\nesaul and the Cossacks rode past Petya and Denisov. When they had\nall ridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill.\nSlipping onto their haunches and sliding, the horses descended with\ntheir riders into the ravine. Petya rode beside Denisov, the pulsation\nof his body constantly increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter,\nbut the mist still hid distant objects. Having reached the valley,\nDenisov looked back and nodded to a Cossack beside him.\n\n\"The signal!\" said he.\n\nThe Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the\ntramp of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from\nvarious sides, and then more shots.\n\nAt the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Petya lashed his\nhorse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov who\nshouted at him. It seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was\nfired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.\nCossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the\nbridge he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he\ngalloped on. In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were\nrunning from right to left across the road. One of them fell in the\nmud under his horse\'s feet.\n\nCossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the\nmidst of that crowd terrible screams arose. Petya galloped up, and the\nfirst thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,\nclutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.\n\n\"Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!\" shouted Petya, and giving rein to his\nexcited horse he galloped forward along the village street.\n\nHe could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged\nRussian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,\nwere shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking\nFrenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red\nface, had been defending himself against the hussars. When Petya\ngalloped up the Frenchman had already fallen. \"Too late again!\"\nflashed through Petya\'s mind and he galloped on to the place from\nwhich the rapid firing could be heard. The shots came from the yard of\nthe landowner\'s house he had visited the night before with Dolokhov.\nThe French were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden\nthickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who\ncrowded at the gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached the\ngate, Petya saw Dolokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish tint,\nshouting to his men. \"Go round! Wait for the infantry!\" he exclaimed\nas Petya rode up to him.\n\n\"Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!\" shouted Petya, and without pausing a moment\ngalloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the\nsmoke was thickest.\n\nA volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others\nplashed against something. The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped after\nPetya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke\nsome of the French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes\nto meet the Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the\npond. Petya was galloping along the courtyard, but instead of\nholding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and\nstrangely, slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle. His\nhorse, having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the\nmorning light, stopped suddenly, and Petya fell heavily on to the\nwet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly\nthough his head was quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his skull.\n\nAfter speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the\nhouse with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that\nthey surrendered, Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, who lay\nmotionless with outstretched arms.\n\n\"Done for!\" he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet\nDenisov who was riding toward him.\n\n\"Killed?\" cried Denisov, recognizing from a distance the\nunmistakably lifeless attitude--very familiar to him--in which Petya\'s\nbody was lying.\n\n\"Done for!\" repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance of these words\nafforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who\nwere surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. \"We won\'t take\nthem!\" he called out to Denisov.\n\nDenisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, dismounted, and with\ntrembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained,\nmud-bespattered face which had already gone white.\n\n\"I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!\"\nhe recalled Petya\'s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise\nat the sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denisov turned\naway, walked to the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.\n\nAmong the Russian prisoners rescued by Denisov and Dolokhov was\nPierre Bezukhov.');

On the twenty-second of October that party\nwas no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it\nhad left Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled\nthe first stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other\nhalf had gone on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had\nmarched in front of the prisoners was left; they had all\ndisappeared. The artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them\nduring the first days was now replaced by Marshal Junot\'s enormous\nbaggage train, convoyed by Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a\ncavalry baggage train.\n\nFrom Vyazma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in\nthree columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder\nthat Pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving\nMoscow had now reached the utmost limit.\n\nThe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead\nhorses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments\ncontinually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again\nlagging behind it.\n\nSeveral times during the march false alarms had been given and the\nsoldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run\nheadlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and\nabused each other for their causeless panic.\n\nThese three groups traveling together--the cavalry stores, the\nconvoy of prisoners, and Junot\'s baggage train--still constituted a\nseparate and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly\nmelting away.\n\nOf the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred\nand twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been\ncaptured or left behind. Some of Junot\'s wagons also had been captured\nor abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers\nfrom Davout\'s corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned\nthat a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to\nthe prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had\nbeen shot by the marshal\'s own order because a silver spoon\nbelonging to the marshal had been found in his possession.\n\nThe group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three\nhundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a\nhundred now remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort\nthan even the cavalry saddles or Junot\'s baggage. They understood that\nthe saddles and Junot\'s spoon might be of some use, but that cold\nand hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and\nhungry Russians who froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case\nthe order was to shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but\nrevolting. And the escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition\nthey themselves were in, of giving way to the pity they felt for the\nprisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse, treated\nthem with particular moroseness and severity.\n\nAt Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the\nprisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores,\nseveral of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away,\nbut were recaptured by the French and shot.\n\nThe arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer\nprisoners should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been\nabandoned. All who could walk went together, and after the third stage\nPierre had rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that\nhad chosen Karataev for its master.\n\nOn the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell ill with\nthe fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he\ngrew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know\nwhy, but since Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an\neffort to go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning\nwith which Karataev generally lay down at the halting places, and when\nhe smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than\nbefore, Pierre moved farther away and did not think about him.\n\nWhile imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his\nintellect but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is\ncreated for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the\nsatisfaction of simple human needs, and that all unhappiness arises\nnot from privation but from superfluity. And now during these last\nthree weeks of the march he had learned still another new, consolatory\ntruth--that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned that\nas there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely\nfree, so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack\nfreedom. He learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and\nthat those limits are very near together; that the person in a bed\nof roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now,\nsleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while\nthe other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes\nhe had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet\nthat were covered with sores--his footgear having long since fallen to\npieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife--of his own\nfree will as it had seemed to him--he had been no more free than now\nwhen they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself\nsubsequently termed his sufferings, but which at the time he\nscarcely felt, the worst was the state of his bare, raw, and\nscab-covered feet. (The horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing,\nthe saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was\neven pleasant; there was no great cold, it was always warm walking\nin the daytime, and at night there were the campfires; the lice that\ndevoured him warmed his body.) The one thing that was at first hard to\nbear was his feet.\n\nAfter the second day\'s march Pierre, having examined his feet by the\ncampfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when\neverybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,\nwalked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more\nterrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,\nbut thought of other things.\n\nOnly now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the\nsaving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to\nanother, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows\nsuperfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain\nlimit.\n\nHe did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who\nlagged behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did\nnot think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would\nsoon have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about\nhimself. The harder his position became and the more terrible the\nfuture, the more independent of that position in which he found\nhimself were the joyful and comforting thoughts, memories, and\nimaginings that came to him.');

Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd\naround him and then again at his feet. The former and the latter\nwere alike familiar and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran\nmerrily along the side of the road, sometimes in proof of its\nagility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along\non three, and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at\nthe crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleeker\nthan it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh of different\nanimals--from men to horses--in various stages of decomposition; and\nas the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all\nit wanted.\n\nIt had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment\nit might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began\nraining harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed\nthe water, which ran along the ruts in streams.\n\nPierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps\nin threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally\naddressing the rain, he repeated: \"Now then, now then, go on! Pelt\nharder!\"\n\nIt seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and\ndeep within him his soul was occupied with something important and\ncomforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction\nfrom a conversation with Karataev the day before.\n\nAt their yesterday\'s halting place, feeling chilly by a dying\ncampfire, Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was\nburning better. There Platon Karataev was sitting covered up--head and\nall--with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers\nin his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre\nknew. It was already past midnight, the hour when Karataev was usually\nfree of his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the\nfire and heard Platon\'s voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his\npathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at\nhis heart. His feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he\nwished to go away, but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down,\ntrying not to look at Platon.\n\n\"Well, how are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won\'t grant us death,\"\nreplied Platon, and at once resumed the story he had begun.\n\n\"And so, brother,\" he continued, with a smile on his pale\nemaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes, \"you\nsee, brother...\"\n\nPierre had long been familiar with that story. Karataev had told\nit to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially\njoyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that\ntale as to something new, and the quiet rapture Karataev evidently\nfelt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was\nof an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with his\nfamily, and who went once to the Nizhni fair with a companion--a\nrich merchant.\n\nHaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning\nhis companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained\nknife was found under the old merchant\'s pillow. He was tried,\nknouted, and his nostrils having been torn off, \"all in due form\" as\nKarataev put it, he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.\n\n\"And so, brother\" (it was at this point that Pierre came up), \"ten\nyears or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict,\nsubmitting as he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God\nfor death. Well, one night the convicts were gathered just as we\nare, with the old man among them. And they began telling what each was\nsuffering for, and how they had sinned against God. One told how he\nhad taken a life, another had taken two, a third had set a house on\nfire, while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. So\nthey asked the old man: \'What are you being punished for, Daddy?\'--\'I,\nmy dear brothers,\' said he, \'am being punished for my own and other\nmen\'s sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was\nnot mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant,\nmy dear brothers, and had much property. \'And he went on to tell\nthem all about it in due order. \'I don\'t grieve for myself,\' he\nsays, \'God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my old\nwife and the children,\' and the old man began to weep. Now it happened\nthat in the group was the very man who had killed the other\nmerchant. \'Where did it happen, Daddy?\' he said. \'When, and in what\nmonth?\' He asked all about it and his heart began to ache. So he comes\nup to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet! \'You are\nperishing because of me, Daddy,\' he says. \'It\'s quite true, lads, that\nthis man,\' he says, \'is being tortured innocently and for nothing! I,\'\nhe says, \'did that deed, and I put the knife under your head while you\nwere asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,\' he says, \'for Christ\'s sake!\'\"\n\nKarataev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and\nhe drew the logs together.\n\n\"And the old man said, \'God will forgive you, we are all sinners\nin His sight. I suffer for my own sins,\' and he wept bitter tears.\nWell, and what do you think, dear friends?\" Karataev continued, his\nface brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he\nnow had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his\nstory: \"What do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to\nthe authorities. \'I have taken six lives,\' he says (he was a great\nsinner), \'but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don\'t let\nhim suffer because of me.\' So he confessed and it was all written down\nand the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and\nwhile they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in\nthe papers all in due form--the authorities I mean--time passed. The\naffair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar\'s decree came: to\nset the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been\nawarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man.\n\'Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A\npaper has come from the Tsar!\' so they began looking for him,\" here\nKarataev\'s lower jaw trembled, \"but God had already forgiven him--he\nwas dead! That\'s how it was, dear fellows!\" Karataev concluded and sat\nfor a long time silent, gazing before him with a smile.\n\nAnd Pierre\'s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story\nitself but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that\nlit up Karataev\'s face as he told it, and the mystic significance of\nthat joy.');

From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left\ncame smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the\nprisoners at a trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension\npeople feel at the approach of those in authority. The prisoners\nthronged together and were pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.\n\n\"The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!\" and hardly had\nthe sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses\nrattled by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat\nwith a tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of\nthe marshals. His eye fell on Pierre\'s large and striking figure,\nand in the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre\nthought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.\n\nThe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with\na red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several\nofficers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their\nfaces all looked excited and worried.\n\n\"What did he say? What did he say?\" Pierre heard them ask.\n\nWhile the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in\na crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that\nmorning. He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On\nhis face, besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday\nwhile telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently,\nthere was now an expression of quiet solemnity.\n\nKarataev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with\ntears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say\nsomething to him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself.\nHe made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away.\n\nWhen the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round.\nKarataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch\ntree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look\nround again but went limping up the hill.\n\nFrom behind, where Karataev had been sitting, came the sound of a\nshot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that\nhe had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to\nSmolensk--a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And\nhe again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one\nof whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale,\nand in the expression on their faces--one of them glanced timidly at\nPierre--there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of\nthe young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and\nremembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt\nwhile drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.\n\nBehind him, where Karataev had been sitting, the dog began to\nhowl. \"What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?\" thought Pierre.\n\nHis comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided\nlooking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog\nwas howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their\nfaces.');

He\nagain slept as he had done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino.\n\nAgain real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or\nanother, gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same\nthoughts that had been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk.\n\n\"Life is everything.

This globe was\nalive--a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface\nconsisted of drops closely pressed together, and all these drops moved\nand changed places, sometimes several of them merging into one,\nsometimes one dividing into many. Each drop tried to spread out and\noccupy as much space as possible, but others striving to do the same\ncompressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.\n\n\"That is life,\" said the old teacher.\n\n\"How simple and clear it is,\" thought Pierre. \"How is it I did not\nknow it before?\"\n\n\"God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect\nHim to the greatest extent.

A Frenchman who had just pushed a\nRussian soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting\na piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and\nhis sinewy, hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned\nthe ramrod. His brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly\nvisible by the glow of the charcoal.\n\n\"It\'s all the same to him,\" he muttered, turning quickly to a\nsoldier who stood behind him. \"Brigand! Get away!\"\n\nAnd twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned\naway and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier\nthe Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting\nsomething with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the\nblue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.\n\n\"Ah, he\'s come?\" said Pierre. \"And Plat-\" he began, but did not\nfinish.\n\nSuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his\nfancy--of the look Platon had given him as he sat under the tree, of\nthe shot heard from that spot, of the dog\'s howl, of the guilty\nfaces of the two Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and\nsmoking gun, and of Karataev\'s absence at this halt--and he was on the\npoint of realizing that Karataev had been killed, but just at that\ninstant, he knew not why, the recollection came to his mind of a\nsummer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady on the\nveranda of his house in Kiev.

But after a four days\' halt the mob,\nwith no maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten\ntrack, neither to the right nor to the left but along the old--the\nworst--road, through Krasnoe and Orsha.\n\nExpecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French\nseparated in their flight and spread out over a distance of\ntwenty-four hours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, then the\nkings, then the dukes. The Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take\nthe road to the right beyond the Dnieper--which was the only\nreasonable thing for him to do--themselves turned to the right and\ncame out onto the highroad at Krasnoe. And here as in a game of\nblindman\'s buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing their enemy\nunexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the\nsudden fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their\ncomrades who were farther behind. Then for three days separate\nportions of the French army--first Murat\'s (the vice-king\'s), then\nDavout\'s, and then Ney\'s--ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian\narmy. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage,\ntheir artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the\nRussians by night by making semicircles to the right.\n\nNey, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of\nSmolensk which were in nobody\'s way, because despite the unfortunate\nplight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor\nagainst which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of\nten thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsha with only one thousand men\nleft, having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having\ncrossed the Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.\n\nFrom Orsha they fled farther along the road to Vilna, still\nplaying at blindman\'s buff with the pursuing army. At the Berezina\nthey again became disorganized, many were drowned and many\nsurrendered, but those who got across the river fled farther. Their\nsupreme chief donned a fur coat and, having seated himself in a\nsleigh, galloped on alone, abandoning his companions. The others who\ncould do so drove away too, leaving those who could not to surrender\nor die.');

From the time they\nturned onto the Kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the\narmy, none of the movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might\nhave thought that regarding this period of the campaign the\nhistorians, who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of\none man, would have found it impossible to make the story of the\nretreat fit their theory. But no! Mountains of books have been written\nby the historians about this campaign, and everywhere are described\nNapoleon\'s arrangements, the maneuvers, and his profound plans which\nguided the army, as well as the military genius shown by his marshals.\n\nThe retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he had a free road into a\nwell-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along\nwhich Kutuzov afterwards pursued him--this unnecessary retreat along a\ndevastated road--is explained to us as being due to profound\nconsiderations. Similarly profound considerations are given for his\nretreat from Smolensk to Orsha. Then his heroism at Krasnoe is\ndescribed, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle\nand take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick\nand said:\n\n\"J\'ai assez fait l\'empereur; il est temps de faire le general,\"* but\nnevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the\nscattered fragments of the army he left behind.\n\n\n*\"I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act the\ngeneral.\"\n\n\nThen we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals,\nespecially of Ney--a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he\nmade his way by night around through the forest and across the Dnieper\nand escaped to Orsha, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths\nof his men.\n\nAnd lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic\narmy is presented to us by the historians as something great and\ncharacteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in\nordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is\ntaught to be ashamed of--even that act finds justification in the\nhistorians\' language.\n\nWhen it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of\nhistorical ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly\ncontrary to all that humanity calls right or even just, the historians\nproduce a saving conception of \"greatness.\" \"Greatness,\" it seems,\nexcludes the standards of right and wrong. For the \"great\" man nothing\nis wrong, there is no atrocity for which a \"great\" man can be blamed.\n\n\"C\'est grand!\"* say the historians, and there no longer exists\neither good or evil but only \"grand\" and \"not grand.\" Grand is good,\nnot grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of\nsome special animals called \"heroes.\" And Napoleon, escaping home in a\nwarm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his\ncomrades but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que\nc\'est grand,*[2] and his soul is tranquil.\n\n\n*\"It is great.\"\n\n*[2] That it is great.\n\n\n\"Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n\'y\na qu\'un pas,\"* said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been\nrepeating: \"Sublime! Grand! Napoleon le Grand!\" Du sublime au ridicule\nil n\'y a qu\'un pas.\n\n\n*\"From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.\"\n\n\nAnd it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not\ncommensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to\nadmit one\'s own nothingness and immeasurable meanness.\n\nFor us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no\nhuman actions are incommensurable.

Who has not asked himself how it is\nthat the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three\narmies surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered\nFrench, hungry and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the\nhistorians relate) the aim of the Russians was to stop the French,\nto cut them off, and capture them all?\n\nHow was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than\nthe French had given battle at Borodino, did not achieve its purpose\nwhen it had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim\nwas to capture them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us\nthat when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not\nbeat them? How could that happen?\n\nHistory (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions\nsays that this occurred because Kutuzov and Tormasov and Chichagov,\nand this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers...\n\nBut why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were\nguilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried\nand punished? But even if we admitted that Kutuzov, Chichagov, and\nothers were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still\nincomprehensible why, the position of the Russian army being what it\nwas at Krasnoe and at the Berezina (in both cases we had superior\nforces), the French army with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not\ncaptured, if that was what the Russians aimed at.\n\nThe explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military\nhistorians (to the effect that Kutuzov hindered an attack) is\nunfounded, for we know that he could not restrain the troops from\nattacking at Vyazma and Tarutino.\n\nWhy was the Russian army--which with inferior forces had withstood\nthe enemy in full strength at Borodino--defeated at Krasnoe and the\nBerezina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was\nnumerically superior?\n\nIf the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing\nNapoleon and his marshals--and that aim was not merely frustrated\nbut all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled--then\nthis last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the\nFrench to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly considered\nvictorious by Russian historians.\n\nThe Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims\nof logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical\nrhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit\nthat the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for\nNapoleon and defeats for Kutuzov.\n\nBut putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a\nconclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French\nvictories brought the French complete destruction, while the series of\nRussian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the\nliberation of their country.\n\nThe source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the\nhistorians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns\nand the generals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth,\nhave attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that\nnever existed, namely that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon\nwith his marshals and his army.\n\nThere never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have\nbeen senseless and its attainment quite impossible.\n\nIt would have been senseless, first because Napoleon\'s\ndisorganized army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that\nis to say, was doing just what every Russian desired. So what was\nthe use of performing various operations on the French who were\nrunning away as fast as they possibly could?\n\nSecondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men\nwhose whole energy was directed to flight.\n\nThirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one\'s own\ntroops in order to destroy the French army, which without external\ninterference was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its\npath was not blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than\nit actually did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original\narmy.\n\nFourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the\nEmperor, kings, and dukes--whose capture would have been in the\nhighest degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit\ndiplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized.\nStill more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of\nthe French, when our own army had melted away to half before\nreaching Krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy\nthe corps of prisoners, and when our men were not always getting\nfull rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger.\n\nAll the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon\nand his army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving\nout of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had\nplanted, should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The\nonly thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he\nwas very angry. But not even that could be said for those who drew\nup this project, for it was not they who had suffered from the\ntrampled beds.\n\nBut besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would\nhave been senseless, it was impossible.\n\nIt was impossible first because--as experience shows that a\nthree-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with\nthe plans--the probability of Chichagov, Kutuzov, and Wittgenstein\neffecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to\nbe tantamount to impossibility, as in fact thought Kutuzov, who when\nhe received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great\ndistances do not yield the desired results.\n\nSecondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with\nwhich Napoleon\'s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than\nthe Russians possessed would have been required.\n\nThirdly it was impossible, because the military term \"to cut off\"\nhas no meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army.\nTo cut off an army--to bar its road--is quite impossible, for there is\nalways plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when\nnothing can be seen, as the military scientists might convince\nthemselves by the example of Krasnoe and of the Berezina. It is only\npossible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it\nis only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one\'s hand. Men\ncan only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules\nof strategy and tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops\nquite rightly did not consider that this suited them, since death by\nhunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike.\n\nFourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the\nworld began has a war been fought under such conditions as those\nthat obtained in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the\nFrench strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done\nmore without destroying itself.\n\nDuring the movement of the Russian army from Tarutino to Krasnoe\nit lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to\nthe population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of\nthe army without a battle.\n\nAnd it is of this period of the campaign--when the army lacked boots\nand sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and\nwas camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees\nof frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and\nthe rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be\nmaintained, when men were taken into that region of death where\ndiscipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for\nmonths, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and\ncold, when half the army perished in a single month--it is of this\nperiod of the campaign that the historians tell us how Miloradovich\nshould have made a flank march to such and such a place, Tormasov to\nanother place, and Chichagov should have crossed (more than\nknee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so \"routed\" and\n\"cut off\" the French and so on and so on.\n\nThe Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should\nhave been done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not\nto blame because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed\nthat they should do what was impossible.\n\nAll that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between\nthe facts and the historical accounts only arises because the\nhistorians dealing with the matter have written the history of the\nbeautiful words and sentiments of various generals, and not the\nhistory of the events.\n\nTo them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting, and so do\ntheir surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but\nthe question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals\nand in graves does not even interest them, for it does not come within\nthe range of their investigation.\n\nYet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans\nand consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who\ntook a direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed\ninsoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.\n\nThe aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in\nthe imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it\nwas senseless and unattainable.\n\nThe people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion.\nThat aim was attained in the first place of itself, as the French\nran away, and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight.\nSecondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying\nthe French, and thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was\nfollowing the French, ready to use its strength in case their movement\nstopped.\n\nThe Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the\nexperienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a\nmenace than to strike the running animal on the head.');

But when it\nis a beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this\nhorror at the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual\nwound, which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes\nheals, but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.\n\nAfter Prince Andrew\'s death Natasha and Princess Mary alike felt\nthis. Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing\ncloud of death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the\nface. They carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and\npainful contact. Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street,\na summons to dinner, the maid\'s inquiry what dress to prepare, or\nworse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an\ninsult, painfully irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary\nquiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful\nchoir that still resounded in their imagination, and hindered their\ngazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant\nhad opened out before them.\n\nOnly when alone together were they free from such outrage and\npain. They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it\nwas of very unimportant matters.\n\nBoth avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of\na future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did\nthey avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them\nthat what they had lived through and experienced could not be\nexpressed in words, and that any reference to the details of his\nlife infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been\naccomplished before their eyes.\n\nContinued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of\neverything that might lead up to the subject--this halting on all\nsides at the boundary of what they might not mention--brought before\ntheir minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were\nboth feeling.\n\nBut pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete\njoy. Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent\narbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was\nthe first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which\nshe had dwelt for the first fortnight. She received letters from her\nrelations to which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas\nhad been put was damp and he began to cough; Alpatych came to\nYaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice\nand suggestions that they should return to Moscow to the house on\nthe Vozdvizhenka Street, which had remained uninjured and needed\nonly slight repairs. Life did not stand still and it was necessary\nto live. Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm\nof secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then, and\nsorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natasha alone, yet the\ncares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded\nto them. She went through the accounts with Alpatych, conferred with\nDessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and made preparations\nfor the journey to Moscow.\n\nNatasha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making\npreparations for departure, held aloof from her too.\n\nPrincess Mary asked the countess to let Natasha go with her to\nMoscow, and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw\ntheir daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change\nof scene and the advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.\n\n\"I am not going anywhere,\" Natasha replied when this was proposed to\nher. \"Do please just leave me alone!\" And she ran out of the room,\nwith difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation\nrather than of sorrow.\n\nAfter she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her\ngrief, Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself,\nsitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and\ntwisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing\nintently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This\nsolitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of\nit. As soon as anyone entered she got up quickly, changed her position\nand expression, and picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting\nimpatiently for the intruder to go.\n\nShe felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on\nwhich--with a terrible questioning too great for her strength--her\nspiritual gaze was fixed.\n\nOne day toward the end of December Natasha, pale and thin, dressed\nin a black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a\nknot, was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously\ncrumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at\na corner of the door.\n\nShe was gazing in the direction in which he had gone--to the other\nside of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never\nbefore thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and\nimprobable, was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible\nthan this side of life, where everything was either emptiness and\ndesolation or suffering and indignity.\n\nShe was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine\nhim otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he\nhad been at Mytishchi, at Troitsa, and at Yaroslavl.\n\nShe saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own,\nand sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.\n\nThere he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning\nhis head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his\nshoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and\na wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs\ntwitches just perceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha knows that he is\nstruggling with terrible pain. \"What is that pain like? Why does he\nhave that pain? What does he feel? How does it hurt him?\" thought\nNatasha. He noticed her watching him, raised his eyes, and began to\nspeak seriously:\n\n\"One thing would be terrible,\" said he: \"to bind oneself forever\nto a suffering man. It would be continual torture.\" And he looked\nsearchingly at her. Natasha as usual answered before she had time to\nthink what she would say. She said: \"This can\'t go on--it won\'t. You\nwill get well--quite well.\"\n\nShe now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what\nshe had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at\nthose words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in\nthat protracted gaze.\n\n\"I agreed,\" Natasha now said to herself, \"that it would be\ndreadful if he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because\nit would have been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently.\nHe thought it would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live\nand feared death. And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not\nsay what I meant. I thought quite differently. Had I said what I\nthought, I should have said: even if he had to go on dying, to die\ncontinually before my eyes, I should have been happy compared with\nwhat I am now. Now there is nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No,\nhe did not and never will know it. And now it will never, never be\npossible to put it right.\" And now he again seemed to be saying the\nsame words to her, only in her imagination Natasha this time gave\nhim a different answer. She stopped him and said: \"Terrible for you,\nbut not for me! You know that for me there is nothing in life but you,\nand to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me,\" and he\ntook her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible\nevening four days before his death. And in her imagination she said\nother tender and loving words which she might have said then but\nonly spoke now: \"I love thee!... thee! I love, love...\" she said,\nconvulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate\neffort...\n\nShe was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in\nher eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.\nAgain everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again\nwith a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And\nnow, now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at\nthe instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing\nitself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her\nears. Dunyasha, her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a\nfrightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.\n\n\"Come to your Papa at once, please!\" said she with a strange,\nexcited look. \"A misfortune... about Peter Ilynich... a letter,\" she\nfinished with a sob.');

Love awoke and\nso did life.\n\nPrince Andrew\'s last days had bound Princess Mary and Natasha\ntogether; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another.\nPrincess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked\nafter Natasha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed\nin her mother\'s bedroom had strained Natasha\'s physical strength.\n\nOne afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever, Princess Mary\ntook her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Natasha lay\ndown, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away\nshe called her back.\n\n\"I don\'t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\"\n\n\"You are tired--try to sleep.\"\n\n\"No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\"\n\n\"She is much better. She spoke so well today,\" said Princess Mary.\n\nNatasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned\nPrincess Mary\'s face.\n\n\"Is she like him?\" thought Natasha. \"Yes, like and yet not like. But\nshe is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me.\nWhat is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind\nlike? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\"\n\n\"Mary,\" she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\'s hand to herself,\n\"Mary, you mustn\'t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love\nyou! Let us be quite, quite friends.\"\n\nAnd Natasha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making\nPrincess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her\nfeelings.\n\nFrom that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only\nbetween women was established between Princess Mary and Natasha.\nThey were continually kissing and saying tender things to one\nanother and spent most of their time together. When one went out the\nother became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt\nmore in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself\nwhen alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them;\nan exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other\'s\npresence.\n\nSometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were\nalready in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They\nspoke most of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her\nchildhood, of her mother, her father, and her daydreams; and\nNatasha, who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly\nturned away from that life of devotion, submission, and the poetry\nof Christian self-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to Princess\nMary by affection, learned to love her past too and to understand a\nside of life previously incomprehensible to her. She did not think\nof applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life, for she\nwas accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood and loved in\nanother those previously incomprehensible virtues. For Princess\nMary, listening to Natasha\'s tales of childhood and early youth, there\nalso opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life: belief\nin life and its enjoyment.\n\nJust as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they\nthought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him\nhad the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without\nbeing conscious of it.\n\nNatasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all\ntalked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was\nsuddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,\nand loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm\ncarefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her\ndrawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed\nto her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.\n\nOne day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.\nUnconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and\nthen, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.\n\nAnother time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled, so she\ncalled again--though she could hear Dunyasha coming--called her in the\ndeep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened\nattentively to herself.\n\nShe did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the\nlayer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable,\ndelicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking\nroot would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed\nher down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound\nhad begun to heal from within.\n\nAt the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count\ninsisted on Natasha\'s going with her to consult the doctors.');

The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the\nFrench could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke\ndown, and the information received of the movements of the French\nwas never reliable.\n\nThe men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous\nmarching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not\ngo any faster.\n\nTo realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only\nnecessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not\nlosing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarutino and\nless than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that\nplace a hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with only fifty\nthousand.\n\nThe rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our\narmy as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference\nwas that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of\ndestruction as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen\nwere left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind\nwere among their own people. The chief cause of the wastage of\nNapoleon\'s army was the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing\nproof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army.\n\nKutuzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the\nmovement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian\narmy generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at\nTarutino and Vyazma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of\nour army.\n\nBut besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of\nthe army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident,\nanother reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself\nto Kutuzov. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French.\nThe road the French would take was unknown, and so the closer our\ntroops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover.\nOnly by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag\npath of the French. All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals\nmeant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches,\nwhereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches. To\nthat end Kutuzov\'s activity was directed during the whole campaign\nfrom Moscow to Vilna--not casually or intermittently but so\nconsistently that he never once deviated from it.\n\nKutuzov felt and knew--not by reasoning or science but with the\nwhole of his Russian being--what every Russian soldier felt: that\nthe French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven\nout; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the\nhardship of this march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled for\nsuch a time of the year.\n\nBut to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,\nwho wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for\nsome reason to capture a king or a duke--it seemed that now--when any\nbattle must be horrible and senseless--was the very time to fight and\nconquer somebody. Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after\nanother they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those\nsoldiers--ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved--who within\na month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their\nnumber, and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a\ngreater distance than they had already traversed, before they reached\nthe frontier.\n\nThis longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow,\nand to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians\nstumbled on the French army.\n\nSo it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to find one of the three\nFrench columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen\nthousand men. Despite all Kutuzov\'s efforts to avoid that ruinous\nencounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob\nof French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Krasnoe for three\ndays.\n\nToll wrote a disposition: \"The first column will march to so and\nso,\" etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the\ndisposition. Prince Eugene of Wurttemberg fired from a hill over the\nFrench crowds that were running past, and demanded reinforcements\nwhich did not arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and\nhid themselves in the forest by night, making their way round as\nbest they could, and continued their flight.\n\nMiloradovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the\ncommissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found\nwhen he was wanted--that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche* as he\nstyled himself--who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys\ndemanding their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was\nordered to do.\n\n\n*Knight without fear and without reproach.\n\n\n\"I give you that column, lads,\" he said, riding up to the troops and\npointing out the French to the cavalry.\n\nAnd the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could\nscarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented to\nthem--that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,\nfrost-bitten, and starving--and the column that had been presented\nto them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been\nanxious to do.\n\nAt Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several\nhundred cannon, and a stick called a \"marshal\'s staff,\" and disputed\nas to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their\nachievement--though they much regretted not having taken Napoleon,\nor at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, and reproached one\nanother and especially Kutuzov for having failed to do so.\n\nThese men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of\nthe most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes\nand imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable\ndeed. They blamed Kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the\ncampaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he\nthought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from\nthe Linen Factories because he was comfortable there, that at\nKrasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was\nthere he had quite lost his head, and that it was probable that he had\nan understanding with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so\non, and so on.\n\nNot only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk\nin this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as\ngrand, while Kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty,\ndissolute, weak old courtier, and by Russians as something\nindefinite--a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian\nname.');

The\nEmperor was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written\nby order of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutuzov was a\ncunning court liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by\nhis blunders at Krasnoe and the Berezina he deprived the Russian\narmy of the glory of complete victory over the French.*\n\n\n*History of the year 1812. The character of Kutuzov and\nreflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at Krasnoe,\nby Bogdanovich.\n\n\nSuch is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian\nmind does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary\nindividuals who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their\npersonal will to it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish\nsuch men for discerning the higher laws.\n\nFor Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon--that\nmost insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile,\nshowed human dignity--Napoleon is the object of adulation and\nenthusiasm; he is grand. But Kutuzov--the man who from the beginning\nto the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or\ndeed from Borodino to Vilna, presented an example exceptional in\nhistory of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future\nimportance of what was happening--Kutuzov seems to them something\nindefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of him and of the year 1812\nthey always seem a little ashamed.\n\nAnd yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose\nactivity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be\ndifficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the\nwill of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find\nan instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being\nso completely accomplished as that to which all Kutuzov\'s efforts were\ndirected in 1812.\n\nKutuzov never talked of \"forty centuries looking down from the\nPyramids,\" of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of what\nhe intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said\nnothing about himself, adopted no prose, always appeared to be the\nsimplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most\nordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de\nStael, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with\ngenerals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who\ntried to prove anything to him. When Count Rostopchin at the Yauza\nbridge galloped up to Kutuzov with personal reproaches for having\ncaused the destruction of Moscow, and said: \"How was it you promised\nnot to abandon Moscow without a battle?\" Kutuzov replied: \"And I shall\nnot abandon Moscow without a battle,\" though Moscow was then already\nabandoned. When Arakcheev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that\nErmolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutuzov replied:\n\"Yes, I was just saying so myself,\" though a moment before he had said\nquite the contrary. What did it matter to him--who then alone amid a\nsenseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what\nwas happening--what did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed\nthe calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it\nmatter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.\n\nNot merely in these cases but continually did that old man--who by\nexperience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the\nwords serving as their expression are not what move people--use\nquite meaningless words that happened to enter his head.\n\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the\nwhole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single\naim toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite\nof himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his\nreal thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be\nunderstood. Beginning with the battle of Borodino, from which time his\ndisagreement with those about him began, he alone said that the battle\nof Borodino was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in\nhis dispatches and reports up to the time of his death. He alone\nsaid that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to\nLauriston\'s proposal of peace, he said: There can be no peace, for\nsuch is the people\'s will. He alone during the retreat of the French\nsaid that all our maneuvers are useless, everything is being\naccomplished of itself better than we could desire; that the enemy\nmust be offered \"a golden bridge\"; that neither the Tarutino, the\nVyazma, nor the Krasnoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some\nforce to reach the frontier with, and that he would not sacrifice a\nsingle Russian for ten Frenchmen.\n\nAnd this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakcheev\nto please the Emperor, he alone--incurring thereby the Emperor\'s\ndispleasure--said in Vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier\nis useless and harmful.\n\nNor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of\nthe events. His actions--without the smallest deviation--were all\ndirected to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his\nstrength for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3)\nto drive them out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the\nsufferings of our people and of our army.\n\nThis procrastinator Kutuzov, whose motto was \"Patience and Time,\"\nthis enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodino, investing\nthe preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutuzov\nwho before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be\nlost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his\ndeath that Borodino was a victory, despite the assurance of generals\nthat the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have\nto retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during\nthe whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then,\nshould not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the\nfrontiers of Russia crossed.\n\nIt is easy now to understand the significance of these events--if\nonly we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that\nexisted only in the heads of a dozen individuals--for the events and\nresults now lie before us.\n\nBut how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general\nopinion, so truly discern the importance of the people\'s view of the\nevents that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?\n\nThe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of\nthe events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he\npossessed in full purity and strength.\n\nOnly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling\ncaused the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar\'s wish,\nto select him--an old man in disfavor--to be their representative in\nthe national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest\nhuman pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all\nhis powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing\npity on them.\n\nThat simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not\nbe cast in the false mold of a European hero--the supposed ruler of\nmen--that history has invented.\n\nTo a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception\nof greatness.');

Toward evening--after much disputing and many mistakes\nmade by generals who did not go to their proper places, and after\nadjutants had been sent about with counterorders--when it had become\nplain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and\nwould be no battle, Kutuzov left Krasnoe and went to Dobroe whither\nhis headquarters had that day been transferred.\n\nThe day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his plump\nlittle white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented\ngenerals who whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the\nroad groups of French prisoners captured that day (there were seven\nthousand of them) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires.\nNear Dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with\ntalk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get\nhold of, were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed\nFrench guns. At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of\ntalk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov who, wearing a white\ncap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round\nshoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white horse. One of\nthe generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had\nbeen captured.\n\nKutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general\nwas saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he\ngazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a\nspecially wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by\nfrost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and\nfestering eyes.\n\nOne group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them,\none of whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of\nraw flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial\nin the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the\nmalevolent expression with which, after a glance at Kutuzov, the\nsoldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what\nhe was doing.\n\nKutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He\npuckered his face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head.\nAt another spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a\nFrenchman on the shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly\nmanner, and Kutuzov with the same expression on his face again\nswayed his head.\n\n\"What were you saying?\" he asked the general, who continuing his\nreport directed the commander in chief\'s attention to some standards\ncaptured from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhensk\nregiment.\n\n\"Ah, the standards!\" said Kutuzov, evidently detaching himself\nwith difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.\n\nHe looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at\nhim from all sides awaiting a word from him.\n\nHe stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment, sighed deeply,\nand closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers\ncarrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in\nchief with them. Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then,\nsubmitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his\nposition, raised his head and began to speak. A throng of officers\nsurrounded him. He looked attentively around at the circle of\nofficers, recognizing several of them.\n\n\"I thank you all!\" he said, addressing the soldiers and then again\nthe officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words\nwere distinctly heard. \"I thank you all for your hard and faithful\nservice. The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor\nto you forever.\"\n\nHe paused and looked around.\n\n\"Lower its head, lower it!\" he said to a soldier who had\naccidentally lowered the French eagle he was holding before the\nPreobrazhensk standards. \"Lower, lower, that\'s it. Hurrah lads!\" he\nadded, addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin.\n\n\"Hur-r-rah!\" roared thousands of voices.\n\nWhile the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov leaned forward in his\nsaddle and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and\napparently ironic gleam.\n\n\"You see, brothers...\" said he when the shouts had ceased... and all\nat once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no\nlonger the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who\nwanted to tell his comrades something very important.\n\nThere was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of\nthe soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was\ngoing to say.\n\n\"You see, brothers, I know it\'s hard for you, but it can\'t be\nhelped! Bear up; it won\'t be for long now! We\'ll see our visitors\noff and then we\'ll rest. The Tsar won\'t forget your service. It is\nhard for you, but still you are at home while they--you see what\nthey have come to,\" said he, pointing to the prisoners. \"Worse off\nthan our poorest beggars. While they were strong we didn\'t spare\nourselves, but now we may even pity them. They are human beings too.\nIsn\'t it so, lads?\"\n\nHe looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze\nfixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew\nbrighter and brighter with an old man\'s mild smile, which drew the\ncorners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased\nspeaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity.\n\n\"But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody\nbastards!\" he cried, suddenly lifting his head.\n\nAnd flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first\ntime during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the\nsoldiers laughing joyfully and shouting \"Hurrah!\"\n\nKutuzov\'s words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could\nhave repeated the field marshal\'s address, begun solemnly and then\nchanging into an old man\'s simplehearted talk; but the hearty\nsincerity of that speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined\nwith pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause,\nexactly expressed by that old man\'s good-natured expletives, was not\nmerely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found\nexpression in their joyous and long-sustained shouts. Afterwards\nwhen one of the generals addressed Kutuzov asking whether he wished\nhis caleche to be sent for, Kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a\nsob, being evidently greatly moved.');

All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional\nlightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the\nfalling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost\ngrew keener.\n\nAn infantry regiment which had left Tarutino three thousand strong\nbut now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that\nnight at its halting place--a village on the highroad. The\nquartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were\nfull of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff.\nThere was only one hut available for the regimental commander.\n\nThe commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the\nvillage and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.\n\nLike some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its\nlair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep\nthrough the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village,\nand immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of\nbranches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another\nsection amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a\ngroup was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the\nhorses. A third section scattered through the village arranging\nquarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French corpses\nthat were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and\nthatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve\nfor shelter.\n\nSome fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle\nwall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.\n\n\"Now then, all together--shove!\" cried the voices, and the huge\nsurface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost,\nwas seen swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked\nmore and more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had\nbeen pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.\n\n\"Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That\'s it... Where\nare you shoving to?\"\n\n\"Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!\"\n\nAll stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to\nsing. At the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty\nvoices roared out at once: \"Oo-oo-oo-oo! That\'s it. All together!\nHeave away, boys!...\" but despite their united efforts the wattle\nhardly moved, and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing\nof the men was audible.\n\n\"Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...\nwill you? You may want us one of these days.\"\n\nSome twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into\nthe village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about\nthirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the\nvillage street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of\nthe gasping men.\n\n\"Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now...\"\n\nMerry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.\n\n\"What are you up to?\" suddenly came the authoritative voice of a\nsergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.\n\"There are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you\nfoul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I\'ll give it to you!\" shouted he,\nhitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.\n\"Can\'t you make less noise?\"\n\nThe men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and\nwiped his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling\nagainst the wattle.\n\n\"There, how that devil hits out! He\'s made my face all bloody,\" said\nhe in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.\n\n\"Don\'t you like it?\" said a laughing voice, and moderating their\ntones the men moved forward.\n\nWhen they were out of the village they began talking again as loud\nas before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.\n\nIn the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered\nand were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day\nand the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a\nflank march to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture\nhim.\n\nBy the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place\nthe campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood\ncrackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers\nflitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been\ntrodden down.\n\nAxes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without\nany orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night,\nshelters were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being\nboiled, and muskets and accouterments put in order.\n\nThe wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by\nthe Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket\nrests, and a campfire was built before it.

This was\nbecause all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were\nsifted out of the army day by day. All the physically or morally\nweak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the\narmy--physically and mentally--remained.\n\nMore men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company\nthan anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and\ntheir campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by\ntheir wattle they demanded contributions of fuel.\n\n\"Eh, Makeev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you\nlost or have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!\" shouted a\nred-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking\nbecause of the smoke but not moving back from the fire. \"And you,\nJackdaw, go and fetch some wood!\" said he to another soldier.\n\nThis red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being\nrobust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier they\ncalled \"Jackdaw,\" a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose\nobediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the\nlight of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier\ncarrying a load of wood.\n\n\"Bring it here--that\'s fine!\"\n\nThey split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with\ntheir mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats,\nmaking the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit\ntheir pipes. The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood,\nsetting his arms akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and\ndeftly on the spot where he stood.\n\n\"Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It\'s well that I\'m a\nmusketeer...\" he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.\n\n\"Look out, your soles will fly off!\" shouted the red-haired man,\nnoticing that the sole of the dancer\'s boot was hanging loose. \"What a\nfellow you are for dancing!\"\n\nThe dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw\nit on the fire.\n\n\"Right enough, friend,\" said he, and, having sat down, took out of\nhis knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his\nfoot. \"It\'s the steam that spoils them,\" he added, stretching out\nhis feet toward the fire.\n\n\"They\'ll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we\'ve\nfinished hammering them, we\'re to receive double kits!\"\n\n\"And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after all, it\nseems,\" said one sergeant major.\n\n\"I\'ve had an eye on him this long while,\" said the other.\n\n\"Well, he\'s a poor sort of soldier...\"\n\n\"But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes, it\'s all very well, but when a man\'s feet are frozen how can\nhe walk?\"\n\n\"Eh? Don\'t talk nonsense!\" said a sergeant major.\n\n\"Do you want to be doing the same?\" said an old soldier, turning\nreproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.\n\n\"Well, you know,\" said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in\na squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the\nfire, \"a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it\'s death. Take\nme, now! I\'ve got no strength left,\" he added, with sudden\nresolution turning to the sergeant major. \"Tell them to send me to\nhospital; I\'m aching all over; anyway I shan\'t be able to keep up.\"\n\n\"That\'ll do, that\'ll do!\" replied the sergeant major quietly.\n\nThe soldier said no more and the talk went on.\n\n\"What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is\nthat not one of them had what you might call real boots on,\" said a\nsoldier, starting a new theme. \"They were no more than make-believes.\"\n\n\"The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for\nthe colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,\"\nput in the dancer. \"As they turned them over one seemed still alive\nand, would you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.\"\n\n\"But they\'re a clean folk, lads,\" the first man went on; \"he was\nwhite--as white as birchbark--and some of them are such fine\nfellows, you might think they were nobles.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.\"\n\n\"But they don\'t understand our talk at all,\" said the dancer with\na puzzled smile. \"I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in\nhis own way. A queer lot!\"\n\n\"But it\'s strange, friends,\" continued the man who had wondered at\ntheir whiteness, \"the peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when\nthey began burying the dead--where the battle was you know--well,\nthose dead had been lying there for nearly a month, and says the\npeasant, \'they lie as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell\nas a puff of powder smoke.\'\"\n\n\"Was it from the cold?\" asked someone.\n\n\"You\'re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If\nit had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. \'But,\'\nhe says, \'go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,\' he\nsays, \'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as\nwe drag them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,\' he says, \'are\nwhite as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.\'\"\n\nAll were silent.\n\n\"It must be from their food,\" said the sergeant major. \"They used to\ngobble the same food as the gentry.\"\n\nNo one contradicted him.\n\n\"That peasant near Mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were\nall called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days\nand still didn\'t finish carting the dead away. And as for the\nwolves, he says...\"\n\n\"That was a real battle,\" said an old soldier. \"It\'s the only one\nworth remembering; but since that... it\'s only been tormenting folk.\"\n\n\"And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them\nand, my word, they didn\'t let us get near before they just threw\ndown their muskets and went on their knees. \'Pardon!\' they say. That\'s\nonly one case. They say Platov took \'Poleon himself twice. But he\ndidn\'t know the right charm. He catches him and catches him--no\ngood! He turns into a bird in his hands and flies away. And there\'s no\nway of killing him either.\"\n\n\"You\'re a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I come to look at you!\"\n\n\"Liar, indeed! It\'s the real truth.\"\n\n\"If he fell into my hands, when I\'d caught him I\'d bury him in the\nground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he\'s\nruined!\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow we\'re going to end it. He won\'t come here again,\"\nremarked the old soldier, yawning.\n\nThe conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to\nsleep.\n\n\"Look at the stars. It\'s wonderful how they shine! You would think\nthe women had spread out their linen,\" said one of the men, gazing\nwith admiration at the Milky Way.\n\n\"That\'s a sign of a good harvest next year.\"\n\n\"We shall want some more wood.\"\n\n\"You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That\'s queer.\"\n\n\"O Lord!\"\n\n\"What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he\'s\nsprawling!\"\n\nIn the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen\nasleep could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now\nand again exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces\noff came a sound of general, merry laughter.\n\n\"Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!\" said one of the\nsoldiers, \"and what a lot of them there are!\"\n\nOne of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.\n\n\"They\'re having such fun,\" said he, coming back. \"Two Frenchies have\nturned up. One\'s quite frozen and the other\'s an awful swaggerer. He\'s\nsinging songs....\"\n\n\"Oh, I\'ll go across and have a look....\"\n\nAnd several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.');

They\ncame up to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our\nsoldiers did not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an\nofficer\'s hat and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he\nhad been going to sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy\nsoldier with a shawl tied round his head, was stronger. He raised\nhis companion and said something, pointing to his mouth. The\nsoldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the ground\nfor the sick man, and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for\nboth of them.\n\nThe exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his\nhead wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.\n\nWhen Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he\nsuddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the\nsoldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and\nresting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire,\nlooking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally\nhe emitted a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel,\npointing to his shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact\nthat Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer\nwho had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would\nnot take a French officer into his hut to warm him, and when the\nmessenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to\nbe brought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He rose and tried to walk,\nbut staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held\nhim up.\n\n\"You won\'t do it again, eh?\" said one of the soldiers, winking and\nturning mockingly to Ramballe.\n\n\"Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are--a real peasant!\"\ncame rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.\n\nThey surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two\nsoldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around\ntheir necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:\n\n\"Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh,\nmy brave, kind friends,\" and he leaned his head against the shoulder\nof one of the men like a child.\n\nMeanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire,\nsurrounded by the soldiers.\n\nMorel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes,\nwas wearing a woman\'s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round\nhis head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a\nFrench song in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the\nnearest soldier. The soldiers simply held their sides as they\nwatched him.\n\n\"Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I\'ll soon pick it up. How\nis it?\" said the man--a singer and a wag--whom Morel was embracing.\n\n\"Vive Henri Quatre!

Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to\neat?\"\n\n\"Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after\nstarving.\"\n\nThey gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to\nwork on his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they\nwatched him. The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse\nthemselves with such nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side\nof the fire, but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow\nand glance at Morel with a smile.\n\n\"They are men too,\" said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his\ncoat. \"Even wormwood grows on its own root.\"\n\n\"O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard\nfrost....\"\n\nThey all grew silent.

If so much has been\nand still is written about the Berezina, on the French side this is\nonly because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities\ntheir army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated\nat one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory,\nand on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg--far from the\nseat of war--a plan (again one of Pfuel\'s) had been devised to catch\nNapoleon in a strategic trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured\nhimself that all would happen according to plan, and therefore\ninsisted that it was just the crossing of the Berezina that\ndestroyed the French army. In reality the results of the crossing were\nmuch less disastrous to the French--in guns and men lost--than Krasnoe\nhad been, as the figures show.\n\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in the fact\nthat it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans\nfor cutting off the enemy\'s retreat and the soundness of the only\npossible line of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the\narmy demanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd\nfled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed\nto reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was\nimpossible to block its path. This was shown not so much by the\narrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the\nbridges. When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from\nMoscow and women with children who were with the French transport,\nall--carried on by vis inertiae--pressed forward into boats and into\nthe ice-covered water and did not, surrender.\n\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of\npursuers was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own\npeople each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite\nplace he held among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining\nin the same pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share\nin the necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed\nof the fact that half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not\nknow what to do--perished of cold and hunger despite their captors\'\ndesire to save them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The\nmost compassionate Russian commanders, those favorable to the\nFrench--and even the Frenchmen in the Russian service--could do\nnothing for the prisoners. The French perished from the conditions\nto which the Russian army was itself exposed. It was impossible to\ntake bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to\ngive to the French who, though not harmful, or hated, or guilty,\nwere simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but they were\nexceptions.\n\nCertain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was\nhope. Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in\ncollective flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was\nconcentrated.\n\nThe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the\nremnant, especially after the Berezina, on which (in consequence of\nthe Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians,\nand the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed\none another and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of\nthe Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov led to\ndissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly\nexpressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a\nrespectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to\nblame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or\nasking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable\nformality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at\nevery turn.\n\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assumed\nthat it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never\ngrasp the profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his\nphrases (which they thought were mere phrases) about a \"golden\nbridge,\" about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd\nof tatterdemalions, and so forth. They had heard all that before.\nAnd all he said--that it was necessary to await provisions, or that\nthe men had no boots--was so simple, while what they proposed was so\ncomplicated and clever, that it was evident that he was old and stupid\nand that they, though not in power, were commanders of genius.\n\nAfter the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and\nPetersburg hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff\nreached their maximum. Kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged\nhis shoulders. Only once, after the affair of the Berezina, did he get\nangry and write to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the\nEmperor) the following letter:\n\n\"On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency\nplease be so good as to set off for Kaluga on receipt of this, and\nthere await further commands and appointments from His Imperial\nMajesty.\"\n\nBut after Bennigsen\'s departure, the Grand Duke Tsarevich\nConstantine Pavlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the\nbeginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the\narmy by Kutuzov. Now having come to the army, he informed Kutuzov of\nthe Emperor\'s displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the\nslowness of their advance. The Emperor intended to join the army\npersonally in a few days\' time.\n\nThe old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs--this\nsame Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against\nthe sovereign\'s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and\nheir--apparent from the army--who on his own authority and contrary to\nthe Emperor\'s will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now\nrealized at once that his day was over, that his part was played, and\nthat the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he\nunderstood this not merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on\nthe one hand that the military business in which he had played his\npart was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the\nsame time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his\naged body and of the necessity of physical rest.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his \"dear\nVilna\" as he called it. Twice during his career Kutuzov had been\ngovernor of Vilna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured,\nhe found old friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of\nwhich he had so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the\ncares of army and state and, as far as the passions that seethed\naround him allowed, immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had\nformerly been accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that\nhad still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at\nall.\n\nChichagov, one of the most zealous \"cutters-off\" and\n\"breakers-up,\" who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece\nand then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent:\nChichagov, noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the\nEmperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to him\nbecause when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811\nindependently of Kutuzov, and found that peace had already been\nconcluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing\nthat peace was really Kutuzov\'s; this Chichagov was the first to\nmeet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress\nnaval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he\nhanded Kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The\ncontemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man\nin his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of\nChichagov, who knew of the accusations that were being directed\nagainst Kutuzov.\n\nWhen speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentally mentioned that\nthe vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at\nBorisov had been recovered and would be restored to him.\n\n\"You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the\ncontrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give\ndinner parties,\" warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word\nhe spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov\nto be animated by the same desire.\n\nKutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle\npenetrating smile: \"I meant merely to say what I said.\"\n\nContrary to the Emperor\'s wish Kutuzov detained the greater part\nof the army at Vilna. Those about him said that he became\nextraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that\ntown. He attended to army affairs reluctantly, left everything to\nhis generals, and while awaiting the Emperor\'s arrival led a\ndissipated life.\n\nHaving left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his\nsuite--Count Tolstoy, Prince Volkonski, Arakcheev, and others--the\nEmperor reached Vilna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh\ndrove straight to the castle. In spite of the severe frost some\nhundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in\nfront of the castle, as well as a guard of honor of the Semenov\nregiment.\n\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with\nthree foam-flecked horses, shouted \"Coming!\" and Konovnitsyn rushed\ninto the vestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was waiting in the hall\nporter\'s little lodge.\n\nA minute later the old man\'s large stout figure in full-dress\nuniform, his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his\nstomach, waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its\npeaks to the sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking\nwith an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street,\ntook in his hand the report he had prepared for the Emperor.\n\nThere was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew\nfuriously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh\nin which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be\ndescried.\n\nFrom the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating\neffect on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all\nover, readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up\nand, at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the\nsleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began\nspeaking in his smooth, ingratiating voice.\n\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head to foot,\nfrowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to\nthe old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too,\nowing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings,\nhad its usual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob.\n\nThe Emperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and again\npressing the old man\'s hand went with him into the castle.\n\nWhen alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his\ndissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes\nmade at Krasnoe and the Berezina, and informed him of his intentions\nfor a future campaign abroad. Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark. The\nsame submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the\nEmperor\'s commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before\nsettled on his face now.\n\nWhen Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was\ncrossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by\nsomeone\'s voice saying:\n\n\"Your Serene Highness!\"\n\nKutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of\nCount Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which\nlay a small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected\nof him.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed\nacross his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the\nobject that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the\nFirst Class.');

Kutuzov had received the Order of St.\nGeorge of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest\nhonors, but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him.\nThe proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set\nthat example, but everybody understood that the old man was\nblameworthy and good-for-nothing. When Kutuzov, conforming to a custom\nof Catherine\'s day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be\nlowered at the Emperor\'s feet on his entering the ballroom, the\nEmperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people\ncaught the words, \"the old comedian.\"\n\nThe Emperor\'s displeasure with Kutuzov was specially increased at\nVilna by the fact that Kutuzov evidently could not or would not\nunderstand the importance of the coming campaign.\n\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers\nassembled about him: \"You have not only saved Russia, you have saved\nEurope!\" they all understood that the war was not ended.\n\nKutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion\nthat no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of\nRussia, but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that\nRussia had gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the\nimpossibility of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hardships\nalready endured by the people, of the possibility of failure and so\nforth.\n\nThis being the field marshal\'s frame of mind he was naturally\nregarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.\n\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural\nmethod was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with\nBarclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign--to transfer the\nauthority to the Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under\nthe commander in chief\'s feet without upsetting the old man by\ninforming him of the change.\n\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its\nreal strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll,\nKonovnitsyn, and Ermolov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke\nloudly of the field marshal\'s great weakness and failing health.\n\nHis health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to\nanother. And in fact his health was poor.\n\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually--just as he had come from Turkey\nto the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to\nthe army when he was needed there--now when his part was played out,\nKutuzov\'s place was taken by a new and necessary performer.\n\nThe war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every\nRussian heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.\n\nThe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a\nmovement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war\nanother leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing\nfrom Kutuzov\'s and animated by different motives.\n\nAlexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from\neast to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov had\nbeen for the salvation and glory of Russia.\n\nKutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or\nNapoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative\nof the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia\nhad been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was\nnothing left to do as a Russian.

He\nremembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of\npeople and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and\ngenerals who questioned him, he also remembered his difficulty in\nprocuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he remembered his\nincapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of his rescue\nhe had seen the body of Petya Rostov. That same day he had learned\nthat Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodino for more\nthan a month had recently died in the Rostovs\' house at Yaroslavl, and\nDenisov who told him this news also mentioned Helene\'s death,\nsupposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at the\ntime seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its\nsignificance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly\nas possible from places where people were killing one another, to some\npeaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over\nall the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orel he\nimmediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw\nin attendance on him two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had\ncome from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had\nbeen living on his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and\nillness had come to look after him.\n\nIt was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost\nthe impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months\nand got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere\ntomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he\nwould be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long\ntime in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of\ncaptivity. In the same way little by little he came to understand\nthe news he had been told after his rescue, about the death of\nPrince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the destruction of the\nFrench.\n\nA joyous feeling of freedom--that complete inalienable freedom\nnatural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt\noutside Moscow--filled Pierre\'s soul during his convalescence. He\nwas surprised to find that this inner freedom, which was independent\nof external conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of\nexternal liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without\nacquaintances. No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere.\nHe had all he wanted: the thought of his wife which had been a\ncontinual torment to him was no longer there, since she was no more.\n\n\"Oh, how good! How splendid!\" said he to himself when a cleanly laid\ntable was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down\nfor the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the\nFrench had gone and that his wife was no more. \"Oh, how good, how\nsplendid!\"\n\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: \"Well, and what\nthen? What am I going to do?\" And he immediately gave himself the\nanswer: \"Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!\"\n\nThe very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he\nhad continually sought to find--the aim of life--no longer existed for\nhim now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared\ntemporarily--he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not\npresent itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the\ncomplete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at\nthis time.\n\nHe could not see an aim, for he now had faith--not faith in any kind\nof rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living,\never-manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set\nhimself. That search for an aim had been simply a search for God,\nand suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning\nbut by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God\nis here and everywhere. In his captivity he had learned that in\nKarataev God was greater, more infinite and unfathomable than in the\nArchitect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons. He felt like a\nman who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds\nwhat he sought at his very feet. All his life he had looked over the\nheads of the men around him, when he should have merely looked in\nfront of him without straining his eyes.\n\nIn the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable\ninfinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere\nand had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had\nonly what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had\nequipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,\nwhere petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed\nto him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen.\nAnd such had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and\nphilanthropy seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as\nhe had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those distances\nand he had there seen the same pettiness, worldliness, and\nsenselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the great, eternal,\nand infinite in everything, and therefore--to see it and enjoy its\ncontemplation--he naturally threw away the telescope through which\nhe had till now gazed over men\'s heads, and gladly regarded the\never-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around\nhim. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became.\nThat dreadful question, \"What for?\" which had formerly destroyed all\nhis mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question,\n\"What for?\" a simple answer was now always ready in his soul: \"Because\nthere is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls from\na man\'s head.\"');

In appearance\nhe was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and\nseemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something\nspecial of his own. The difference between his former and present self\nwas that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was\nsaid to him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly\nseeking to distinguish something at a distance. At present he still\nforgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before\nhis eyes, but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and\nseemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was\nsaid, though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different.\nFormerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so\npeople had been inclined to avoid him. Now a smile at the joy of\nlife always played round his lips, and sympathy for others, shone in\nhis eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as\ncontented as he was, and people felt pleased by his presence.\n\nPreviously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he\ntalked, and seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in\nconversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him\ntheir most intimate secrets.\n\nThe princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly\nhostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him\nafter the old count\'s death, now after staying a short time in\nOrel--where she had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his\ningratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him--felt to her\nsurprise and vexation that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not\nin any way seek her approval, he merely studied her with interest.\nFormerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and\nirony, and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had\nshown him only the combative side of her nature; but now he seemed to\nbe trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart, and,\nmistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully, she let him see the\nhidden, kindly sides of her character.\n\nThe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more\nsuccessfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and\nshowing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre\'s cunning consisted simply in\nfinding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,\nhard, and (in her own way) proud princess.\n\n\"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence\nof bad people but of people such as myself,\" thought she.\n\nHis servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticed the\nchange that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had\nbecome much \"simpler.\" Terenty, when he had helped him undress and\nwished him good night, often lingered with his master\'s boots in his\nhands and clothes over his arm, to see whether he would not start a\ntalk. And Pierre, noticing that Terenty wanted a chat, generally\nkept him there.\n\n\"Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?\" he would ask.\n\nAnd Terenty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of\nthe old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and\ntalking, or sometimes listening to Pierre\'s stories, and then would go\nout into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master\nand affection for him.\n\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though\nhe considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every\nmoment was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with\nPierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on\nthe characters of his patients in general, and especially of the\nladies.\n\n\"It\'s a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our\nprovincials,\" he would say.\n\nThere were several prisoners from the French army in Orel, and the\ndoctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.\n\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make\nfun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\n\nThe Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk\nwith him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love, and\npour out to him his indignation against the French and especially\nagainst Napoleon.\n\n\"If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight\nsuch a nation,\" he said to Pierre. \"You, who have suffered so from the\nFrench, do not even feel animosity toward them.\"\n\nPierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely\nby evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so\ndoing.\n\nDuring the last days of Pierre\'s stay in Orel his old Masonic\nacquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in\n1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress\nwho had a large estate in Orel province, and he occupied a temporary\npost in the commissariat department in that town.\n\nHearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they had\nnever been intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship\nand intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for\none another. Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man\nof his own circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.\n\nBut to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged\nmuch behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself,\ninto apathy and egotism.\n\n\"You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,\" he said.\n\nBut for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had\nbeen formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To\nPierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to\nthink that he had been like that himself but a short time before.\n\nWillarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family\naffairs, his wife\'s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded\nall these occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that\nthey were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of\nhimself and his family. Military, administrative, political, and\nMasonic interests continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre,\nwithout trying to change the other\'s views and without condemning him,\nbut with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him,\nwas interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon.\n\nThere was a new feature in Pierre\'s relations with Willarski, with\nthe princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met,\nwhich gained for him the general good will. This was his\nacknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man\'s convictions by\nwords, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking,\nfeeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view. This\nlegitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and\nirritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and\nthe interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes\ncomplete contradiction, between men\'s opinions and their lives, and\nbetween one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused\nand gentle smile.\n\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a\ncenter of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary\nquestions, especially requests for money to which, as an extremely\nwealthy man, he was very exposed, produced in him a state of\nhopeless agitation and perplexity. \"To give or not to give?\" he had\nasked himself. \"I have it and he needs it. But someone else needs it\nstill more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they are both impostors?\"\nIn the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these\nsurmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything\nto give. Formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with\nregard to every question concerning his property, when one person\nadvised one thing and another something else.\n\nNow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt\nor perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a\njudge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should\nnot be done.\n\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he\nfelt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first\ntime he had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a\ncolonel, came to him and, after talking a great deal about his\nexploits, concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre\nshould give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children.\nPierre refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was\nafterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to\nappear so insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused\nthe colonel\'s demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to\nartifice when leaving Orel, to induce the Italian officer to accept\nsome money of which he was evidently in need. A further proof to\nPierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was\nfurnished by his decision with regard to his wife\'s debts and to the\nrebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow.\n\nHis head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoned up with him\nhis diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according\nto the head steward\'s calculation, about two million rubles.\n\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an\nestimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be\ndiminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife\'s\ndebts which he was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild\nhis Moscow house and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had\ncost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.\n\n\"Yes, of course that\'s true,\" said Pierre with a cheerful smile.\n\"I don\'t need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much\nricher.\"\n\nBut in January Savelich came from Moscow and gave him an account\nof the state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect\nhad made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses,\nspeaking of this as of a settled matter. About the same time he\nreceived letters from Prince Vasili and other Petersburg acquaintances\nspeaking of his wife\'s debts. And Pierre decided that the steward\'s\nproposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to\nPetersburg and settle his wife\'s affairs and must rebuild in Moscow.\nWhy this was necessary he did not know, but he knew for certain that\nit was necessary. His income would be reduced by three fourths, but he\nfelt it must be done.\n\nWillarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.\n\nDuring the whole time of his convalescence in Orel Pierre had\nexperienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his\njourney he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new\nfaces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt\nlike a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone--the stagecoach driver, the\npost-house overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the\nvillages--had a new significance for him. The presence and remarks of\nWillarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia\nand its backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre\'s\npleasure. Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary\nstrength and vitality--the strength which in that vast space amid the\nsnows maintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique\npeople. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with\nhim--an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions\nthat could lead to nothing--and he smiled joyfully as he listened to\nhim.');

But\nwhen we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy,\nand immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the\ndestruction of the heap, something indestructible, which though\nintangible is the real strength of the colony, still exists; and\nsimilarly, though in Moscow in the month of October there was no\ngovernment and no churches, shrines, riches, or houses--it was still\nthe Moscow it had been in August. All was destroyed, except something\nintangible yet powerful and indestructible.\n\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after\nit had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and\nat first for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all\nhad in common: a desire to get to the place that had been called\nMoscow, to apply their activities there.\n\nWithin a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in\na fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the\nnumber, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in\n1812.\n\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of\nWintzingerode\'s detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and\nresidents who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its\nvicinity. The Russians who entered Moscow, finding it plundered,\nplundered it in their turn. They continued what the French had\nbegun. Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the\nvillages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets.\nThe Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps, and the\nhouseholders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it\nto their own, pretending that it was their property.\n\nBut the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third\ncontingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and\nmore difficult and assumed more definite forms.\n\nThe French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of\nregular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship,\nwith luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms\nwere lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops,\nwarehouses, market stalls, granaries--for the most part still stocked\nwith goods--and there were factories and workshops, palaces and\nwealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government\noffices, churches, and cathedrals. The longer the French remained the\nmore these forms of town life perished, until finally all was merged\ninto one confused, lifeless scene of plunder.\n\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the\nwealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But\nplundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city\nbegan, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater\nthe number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth\nof the city and its regular life restored.\n\nBesides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by\ncuriosity, some by official duties, some by self-interest--house\nowners, clergy, officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and\npeasants--streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart.\n\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off\nplunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses\nout of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades\'\ndiscomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat\ndown one another\'s prices to below what they had been in former\ndays. Gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow\nevery day, and on all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built,\nand old, charred ones repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths.\nCookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses. The\nclergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned.\nDonors contributed Church property that had been stolen. Government\nclerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of\ndocuments in small rooms. The higher authorities and the police\norganized the distribution of goods left behind by the French. The\nowners of houses in which much property had been left, brought there\nfrom other houses, complained of the injustice of taking everything to\nthe Faceted Palace in the Kremlin; others insisted that as the\nFrench had gathered things from different houses into this or that\nhouse, it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was\nfound there. They abused the police and bribed them, made out\nestimates at ten times their value for government stores that had\nperished in the fire, and demanded relief.

He called on Count\nRostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he\nintended to leave for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was\ncelebrating the victory, everything was bubbling with life in the\nruined but reviving city. Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone\nwished to meet him, and everyone questioned him about what he had\nseen. Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all, but\nwas now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in\nany way. To all questions put to him--whether important or quite\ntrifling--such as: Where would he live? Was he going to rebuild?\nWhen was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel\nfor someone?--he replied: \"Yes, perhaps,\" or, \"I think so,\" and so on.\n\nHe had heard that the Rostovs were at Kostroma but the thought of\nNatasha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant\nmemory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from\nsocial obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him,\nhe had aroused in himself.\n\nOn the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskoys\nthat Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days\nof Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre\'s thoughts and now recurred\nto him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary\nwas in Moscow and living in her house--which had not been burned--in\nVozdvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.\n\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of\ntheir friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially\nof the last one at Borodino.\n\n\"Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then\nin? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him\nbefore he died?\" thought Pierre. He recalled Karataev and his death\nand involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and\nyet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the\nlove he felt for both of them.\n\nPierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious\nmood. The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but\nits general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with\na stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence\nof the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the\nhouse, informed him that the princess had gone to her own\napartments, and that she received on Sundays.\n\n\"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the man. \"Please step into the portrait gallery.\"\n\nA few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought\nword from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he\nwould excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\n\nIn a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her\nanother person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess\nalways had lady companions, but who they were and what they were\nlike he never knew or remembered. \"This must be one of her\ncompanions,\" he thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.\n\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her\nhand, \"so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the\nvery last,\" she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion\nwith a shyness that surprised him for an instant.\n\n\"I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of\ngood news we had received for a long time.\"\n\nAgain the princess glanced round at her companion with even more\nuneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre\ninterrupted her.\n\n\"Just imagine--I knew nothing about him!\" said he. \"I thought he had\nbeen killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only\nknow that he fell in with the Rostovs.... What a strange coincidence!\"\n\nPierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the\ncompanion\'s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,\nas often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion\nin the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would\nnot hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.\n\nBut when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary\'s face expressed\nstill greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre\'s\nface to that of the lady in the black dress and said:\n\n\"Do you really not recognize her?\"\n\nPierre looked again at the companion\'s pale, delicate face with\nits black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long\nforgotten and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive\neyes.\n\n\"But no, it can\'t be!\" he thought. \"This stern, thin, pale face that\nlooks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.\"\nBut at that moment Princess Mary said, \"Natasha!\" And with difficulty,\neffort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its\nhinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from\nthat opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre\nwith a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even\nbeen thinking--especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him,\nand enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer\npossible, it was Natasha and he loved her.\n\nAt that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess\nMary, and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had\nbeen unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He\ntried to hide his agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more\nclearly--clearer than any words could have done--did he betray to\nhimself, to her, and to Princess Mary that he loved her.\n\n\"No, it\'s only the unexpectedness of it,\" thought Pierre. But as\nsoon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with\nPrincess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush\nsuffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and\nfear seized his soul. He became confused in his speech and stopped\nin the middle of what he was saying.\n\nPierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not at all expect\nto see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the\nchange in her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin\nand pale, but that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was\nunrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose\neyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life,\nnow when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least\nshadow of a smile: only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly\ninterrogative.\n\nPierre\'s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha\'s\npart, but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her\nwhole face.');

With all his soul he had always\nsought one thing--to be perfectly good--so he could not be afraid of\ndeath. The faults he had--if he had any--were not of his making. So he\ndid soften?... What a happy thing that he saw you again,\" he added,\nsuddenly turning to Natasha and looking at her with eyes full of\ntears.\n\nNatasha\'s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a\nmoment. She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.\n\n\"Yes, that was happiness,\" she then said in her quiet voice with its\ndeep chest notes. \"For me it certainly was happiness.\" She paused.\n\"And he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I\nentered the room....\"\n\nNatasha\'s voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her\nknees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted\nher head and began to speak rapidly.\n\n\"We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare\nto ask about him. Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with\nus. I had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I\nwanted was to see him and be with him,\" she said, trembling, and\nbreathing quickly.\n\nAnd not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she\nhad never yet mentioned to anyone--all she had lived through during\nthose three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslavl.\n\nPierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full\nof tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of\ndeath, nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only\npity for her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.\n\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat\nbeside Natasha, and heard for the first time the story of those last\ndays of her brother\'s and Natasha\'s love.\n\nEvidently Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.\n\nShe spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate\nsecrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish.\nSeveral times she repeated the same thing twice.\n\nDessalles\' voice was heard outside the door asking whether little\nNicholas might come in to say good night.\n\n\"Well, that\'s all--everything,\" said Natasha.\n\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the\ndoor which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and\nrushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.\n\nPierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did\nnot understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.\n\nPrincess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his\nattention to her nephew who had entered the room.\n\nAt that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas\' face, which\nresembled his father\'s, affected Pierre so much that when he had\nkissed the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and\nwent to the window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but\nshe would not let him go.\n\n\"No, Natasha and I sometimes don\'t go to sleep till after two, so\nplease don\'t go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come\nimmediately.\"\n\nBefore Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: \"This is the\nfirst time she has talked of him like that.\"');

Natasha was calm, though a severe and grave expression had\nagain settled on her face. They all three of them now experienced that\nfeeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and\nheartfelt talk. It is impossible to go back to the same\nconversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to\nspeak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went\nsilently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up\nagain. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break\nthe silence, looked at Natasha and at Princess Mary. They had\nevidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with\nsatisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy.\n\n\"Do you take vodka, Count?\" asked Princess Mary, and those words\nsuddenly banished the shadows of the past. \"Now tell us about\nyourself,\" said she. \"One hears such improbable wonders about you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to\nhim. \"They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary\nAbramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had\nhappened, or ought to have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also\ninstructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I have\nnoticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I am an\ninteresting man now); people invite me out and tell me all about\nmyself.\"\n\nNatasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.\n\n\"We have been told,\" Princess Mary interrupted her, \"that you lost\ntwo millions in Moscow. Is that true?\"\n\n\"But I am three times as rich as before,\" returned Pierre.\n\nThough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his\nwife\'s debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that\nhe had become three times as rich as before.\n\n\"What I have certainly gained is freedom,\" he began seriously, but\ndid not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.\n\n\"And are you building?\"\n\n\"Yes. Savelich says I must!\"\n\n\"Tell me, you did not know of the countess\' death when you decided\nto remain in Moscow?\" asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed,\nnoticing that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed\nto his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.\n\n\"No,\" answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning\nPrincess Mary had given to his words. \"I heard of it in Orel and you\ncannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\" he\nadded quickly, glancing at Natasha and noticing on her face\ncuriosity as to how he would speak of his wife, \"but her death shocked\nme terribly. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault,\nand one\'s own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other\nis no longer alive. And then such a death... without friends and\nwithout consolation! I am very, very sorry for her,\" he concluded, and\nwas pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Natasha\'s face.\n\n\"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,\" said\nPrincess Mary.\n\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to\nlook at Natasha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was\ncold, stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n\n\"And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been\ntold?\" said Princess Mary.\n\nPierre laughed.\n\n\"No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken\nprisoner means being Napoleon\'s guest. Not only did I never see him\nbut I heard nothing about him--I was in much lower company!\"\n\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his\ncaptivity was gradually led on to do so.\n\n\"But it\'s true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?\"\nNatasha asked with a slight smile. \"I guessed it then when we met at\nthe Sukharev tower, do you remember?\"\n\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by\nPrincess Mary\'s questions and especially by Natasha\'s into giving a\ndetailed account of his adventures.\n\nAt first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary\nwith him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he\ncame to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was\nunconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed\nemotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he\nhas lived through.\n\nPrincess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at\nNatasha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his\ngoodness. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face\nconstantly changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an\nattention that never wandered--evidently herself experiencing all that\nhe described. Not only her look, but her exclamations and the brief\nquestions she put, showed Pierre that she understood just what he\nwished to convey. It was clear that she understood not only what he\nsaid but also what he wished to, but could not, express in words.\nThe account Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman\nfor protecting whom he was arrested was this: \"It was an awful\nsight--children abandoned, some in the flames... One was snatched\nout before my eyes... and there were women who had their things\nsnatched off and their earrings torn out...\" he flushed and grew\nconfused. \"Then a patrol arrived and all the men--all those who were\nnot looting, that is--were arrested, and I among them.\"\n\n\"I am sure you\'re not telling us everything; I am sure you did\nsomething...\" said Natasha and pausing added, \"something fine?\"\n\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass\nover the horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he should not\nomit anything.\n\nPierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused. By this time he had\nrisen from the table and was pacing the room, Natasha following him\nwith her eyes. Then he added:\n\n\"No, you can\'t understand what I learned from that illiterate\nman--that simple fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, go on!\" said Natasha. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"They killed him almost before my eyes.\"\n\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of\nthe last days of their retreat, of Karataev\'s illness and his death.\n\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now,\nas it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that\nhe was telling it all to Natasha he experienced that pleasure which\na man has when women listen to him--not clever women who when\nlistening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their\nminds and when opportunity offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt\nit to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own\nclever comments prepared in their little mental workshop--but the\npleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and\nabsorb the very best a man shows of himself. Natasha without knowing\nit was all attention: she did not lose a word, no single quiver in\nPierre\'s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor a\nsingle gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its flight and\ntook it straight into her open heart, divining the secret meaning of\nall Pierre\'s mental travail.\n\nPrincess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she\nnow saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the\npossibility of love and happiness between Natasha and Pierre, and\nthe first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.\n\nIt was three o\'clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad\nand stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.\n\nPierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at him intently\nwith bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to\nunderstand something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre\nin shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and\ntried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess\nMary was silent. It occurred to none of them that it was three o\'clock\nand time to go to bed.\n\n\"People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,\" remarked Pierre,\n\"but if at this moment I were asked: \'Would you rather be what you\nwere before you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?\'\nthen for heaven\'s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh!\nWe imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is\nlost, but it is only then that what is new and good begins. While\nthere is life there is happiness. There is much, much before us. I say\nthis to you,\" he added, turning to Natasha.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, answering something quite different. \"I too\nshould wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.\"\n\nPierre looked intently at her.\n\n\"Yes, and nothing more,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"It\'s not true, not true!\" cried Pierre. \"I am not to blame for\nbeing alive and wishing to live--nor you either.\"\n\nSuddenly Natasha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and\nbegan to cry.\n\n\"What is it, Natasha?\" said Princess Mary.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing.\" She smiled at Pierre through her tears. \"Good\nnight! It is time for bed.\"\n\nPierre rose and took his leave.\n\n\nPrincess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked\nof what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her\nopinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him.\n\n\"Well, good night, Mary!\" said Natasha. \"Do you know, I am often\nafraid that by not speaking of him\" (she meant Prince Andrew) \"for\nfear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\"\n\nPrincess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice\nof Natasha\'s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.\n\n\"Is it possible to forget?\" said she.\n\n\"It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard\nand painful, but good, very good!\" said Natasha. \"I am sure he\nreally loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\" she\nadded, suddenly blushing.\n\n\"To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\" said\nPrincess Mary.\n\n\"Do you know, Mary...\" Natasha suddenly said with a mischievous\nsmile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long\ntime, \"he has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if he\nhad just come out of a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral\nbath. Isn\'t it true?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Princess Mary. \"He has greatly improved.\"\n\n\"With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as\nif he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\"\n\n\"I understand why he\" (Prince Andrew) \"liked no one so much as him,\"\nsaid Princess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when\nthey are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike\nhim--in everything.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he\'s wonderful.\"\n\n\"Well, good night,\" said Natasha.\n\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her\nface as if it had been forgotten there.');

He\npaced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult\nproblem and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and\nwincing, and now smiling happily.\n\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, and of their love,\nat one moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that\nfeeling. It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and\ndown the room.\n\n\"Well, what\'s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What\'s to be done?\nEvidently it has to be so,\" said he to himself, and hastily undressing\nhe got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or\nindecision.\n\n\"Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do\neverything that she and I may be man and wife,\" he told himself.\n\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on\nthe Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savelich came to ask him\nabout packing for the journey.\n\n\"What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in\nPetersburg?\" he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. \"Oh, yes,\nlong ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to\nPetersburg,\" he reflected. \"Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good\nfellow he is and how attentive, and how he remembers everything,\" he\nthought, looking at Savelich\'s old face, \"and what a pleasant smile he\nhas!\"\n\n\"Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?\"\nPierre asked him.\n\n\"What\'s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under\nthe late count--the kingdom of heaven be his!--and we have lived under\nyou too, without ever being wronged.\"\n\n\"And your children?\"\n\n\"The children will live just the same. With such masters one can\nlive.\"\n\n\"But what about my heirs?\" said Pierre. \"Supposing I suddenly\nmarry... it might happen,\" he added with an involuntary smile.\n\n\"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good\nthing.\"\n\n\"How easy he thinks it,\" thought Pierre. \"He doesn\'t know how\nterrible it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is\nterrible!\"\n\n\"So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?\" asked\nSavelich.\n\n\"No, I\'ll put it off for a bit. I\'ll tell you later. You must\nforgive the trouble I have put you to,\" said Pierre, and seeing\nSavelich smile, he thought: \"But how strange it is that he should\nnot know that now there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be\nsettled first of all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only\npretending. Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?\"\nPierre reflected. \"No, another time.\"\n\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had\nbeen to see Princess Mary the day before and had there met--\"Whom do\nyou think? Natasha Rostova!\"\n\nThe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than\nif he had seen Anna Semenovna.\n\n\"Do you know her?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"I have seen the princess,\" she replied. \"I heard that they were\narranging a match for her with young Rostov. It would be a very good\nthing for the Rostovs, they are said to be utterly ruined.\"\n\n\"No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?\"\n\n\"I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great\npity.\"\n\n\"No, she either doesn\'t understand or is pretending,\" thought\nPierre. \"Better not say anything to her either.\"\n\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre\'s journey.\n\n\"How kind they all are,\" thought Pierre. \"What is surprising is that\nthey should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of\ninterest to them. And all for me!\"\n\nOn the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him\nto send a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things\nthat were to be returned to their owners that day.\n\n\"And this man too,\" thought Pierre, looking into the face of the\nChief of Police. \"What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind.\nFancy bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is\nnot honest and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn\'t\nhe take bribes? That\'s the way he was brought up, and everybody does\nit. But what a kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at\nme.\"\n\nPierre went to Princess Mary\'s to dinner.\n\nAs he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned\ndown, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The\npicturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the\nburned-out quarters of the town, stretching out and concealing one\nanother, reminded him of the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he\nmet and their passengers, the carpenters cutting the timber for new\nhouses with axes, the women hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked\nat him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: \"Ah, there he\nis! Let\'s see what will come of it!\"\n\nAt the entrance to Princess Mary\'s house Pierre felt doubtful\nwhether he had really been there the night before and really seen\nNatasha and talked to her. \"Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall\ngo in and find no one there.\" But he had hardly entered the room\nbefore he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his\nsense of freedom. She was in the same black dress with soft folds\nand her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet she was\nquite different. Had she been like this when he entered the day before\nhe could not for a moment have failed to recognize her.\n\nShe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince\nAndrew\'s fiancee. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on\nher face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\n\nPierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there,\nbut Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house\nwith her.\n\nNext day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening.\nThough Princess Mary and Natasha were evidently glad to see their\nvisitor and though all Pierre\'s interest was now centered in that\nhouse, by the evening they had talked over everything and the\nconversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly\nbroke off. He stayed so long that Princess Mary and Natasha\nexchanged glances, evidently wondering when he would go. Pierre\nnoticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy and embarrassed, but sat\non because he simply could not get up and take his leave.\n\nPrincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and\ncomplaining of a headache began to say good night.\n\n\"So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I am not going,\" Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone\nand as though offended. \"Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow--but I\nwon\'t say good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any\ncommissions for me,\" said he, standing before Princess Mary and\nturning red, but not taking his departure.\n\nNatasha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other\nhand instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly\nand intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had\nplainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and\nlong-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.\n\nWhen Natasha left the room Pierre\'s confusion and awkwardness\nimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly\nmoved an armchair toward Princess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, I wanted to tell you,\" said he, answering her look as if she\nhad spoken. \"Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess,\nmy dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of\nher, I know it\'s impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a\nbrother to her. No, not that, I don\'t, I can\'t...\"\n\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.\n\n\"Well,\" he went on with an evident effort at self-control and\ncoherence. \"I don\'t know when I began to love her, but I have loved\nher and her alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine\nlife without her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the\nthought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be\nmissing that possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell\nme, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!\" he added\nafter a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply.\n\n\"I am thinking of what you have told me,\" answered Princess Mary.\n\"This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love\nat present...\"\n\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love\nwas impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden\nchange in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be\nhurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she\nwished for.\n\n\"To speak to her now wouldn\'t do,\" said the princess all the same.\n\n\"But what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" said Princess Mary. \"I know...\"\n\nPierre was looking into Princess Mary\'s eyes.\n\n\"Well?... Well?...\" he said.\n\n\"I know that she loves... will love you,\" Princess Mary corrected\nherself.\n\nBefore her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a\nfrightened expression seized Princess Mary\'s hand.\n\n\"What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Princess Mary with a smile. \"Write to her\nparents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it\nto happen and my heart tells me it will.\"\n\n\"No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can\'t be.... How happy I\nam! No, it can\'t be!\" Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess\nMary\'s hands.\n\n\"Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I\'ll go. But I may come again\ntomorrow?\"\n\nNext day Pierre came to say good-by. Natasha was less animated\nthan she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her\nPierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor\nshe existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. \"Is it\npossible? No, it can\'t be,\" he told himself at every look, gesture,\nand word that filled his soul with joy.\n\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could\nnot help holding it a little longer in his own.\n\n\"Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this\ntreasure of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that\nit will one day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to\nmyself?... No, that\'s impossible!...\"\n\n\"Good-by, Count,\" she said aloud. \"I shall look forward very much to\nyour return,\" she added in a whisper.\n\nAnd these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face\nwhich accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of\ninexhaustible memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for\nPierre. \"\'I shall look forward very much to your return....\' Yes, yes,\nhow did she say it? Yes, \'I shall look forward very much to your\nreturn.\' Oh, how happy I am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!\"\nsaid Pierre to himself.');

There\nwas now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had\nundertaken was right or wrong. Only one terrible doubt sometimes\ncrossed his mind: \"Wasn\'t it all a dream? Isn\'t Princess Mary\nmistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I believe all\nthis--and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be sure\nto smile and say: \'How strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn\'t\nhe know that he is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something\naltogether different and higher.\'\"\n\nThat was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now\nmake any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable\nthat if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things.\nEverything ended with that.\n\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself\nincapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life--not for him alone\nbut for the whole world--seemed to him centered in his love and the\npossibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to\nbe occupied with one thing only--his future happiness. Sometimes it\nseemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was\nhimself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be\nbusy with other interests. In every word and gesture he saw\nallusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met by his\nsignificantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a\nsecret understanding between him and them. And when he realized that\npeople might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his\nwhole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that\noccupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.\n\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,\nor when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the\nassumption that everybody\'s welfare depended on this or that issue\nof events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and\nsurprise people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw\neverybody--both those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning\nof life (that is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who\nevidently did not understand it--in the bright light of the emotion\nthat shone within himself, and at once without any effort saw in\neveryone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved.\n\nWhen dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her\nmemory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the\nbliss he now knew. Prince Vasili, who having obtained a new post and\nsome fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed\nto him a pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.\n\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity.\nAll the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained\ntrue for him always.

From that evening she seemed to\nhave forgotten all that had happened to her.

The storm-tossed sea of European history had\nsubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the\nmysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of\ntheir motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\n\nThough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the\nmovement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time.\nVarious groups of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation\nand dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in\ncourse of preparation.\n\nThe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to\nshore as previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures\nwere not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before.\nThey now seemed to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the\nhead of armies, who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by\nordering wars, campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless\nmovement by political and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.\n\nThe historians call this activity of the historical figures \"the\nreaction.\"\n\nIn dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical\npersonages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the\nreaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and\nNapoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte,\nChateaubriand, and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and\nare acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to\nprogress or to reaction.\n\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in\nRussia also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who\naccording to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the\ncommencement of his reign, being the savior of Russia.\n\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist\nto learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander\nfor things he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n\n\"He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he\ndid well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning\nof his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution\nto Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakcheev,\nfavoring Golitsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkov and\nPhotius. He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active\narmy and disbanding the Semenov regiment.\"\n\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the\nhistorians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good\nfor humanity.\n\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\n\nDo not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander\nI (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle\nwith Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of\n1813) flow from the same sources--the circumstances of his birth,\neducation, and life--that made his personality what it was and from\nwhich the actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the\nrestoration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also\nflowed?\n\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches lie?\n\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,\nstanding on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the\nblinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to\nthose strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and\nself-deception inseparable from power; a character who at every moment\nof his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in\nEurope; and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man\nhad his personal habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness,\nbeauty, and truth--that this character--though not lacking in virtue\n(the historians do not accuse him of that)--had not the same\nconception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day\nprofessor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with\nlearning: that is, with books and lectures and with taking notes\nfrom them.\n\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was\nmistaken in his view of what was good for the people, we must\ninevitably assume that the historian who judges Alexander will also\nafter the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of\nwhat is good for humanity. This assumption is all the more natural and\ninevitable because, watching the movement of history, we see that\nevery year and with each new writer, opinion as to what is good for\nmankind changes; so that what once seemed good, ten years later\nseems bad, and vice versa. And what is more, we find at one and the\nsame time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good\nin history: some people regard giving a constitution to Poland and\nforming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in Alexander, while others\nregard it as blameworthy.\n\nThe activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful\nor harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or\nharmful. If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it\ndoes not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether\nthe preservation of my father\'s house in Moscow, or the glory of the\nRussian arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other\nuniversities, or the freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia,\nor the balance of power in Europe, or a certain kind of European\nculture called \"progress\" appear to me to be good or bad, I must admit\nthat besides these things the action of every historic character has\nother more general purposes inaccessible to me.\n\nBut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all\ncontradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by\nwhich to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander\ncould have done everything differently; let us say that with\nguidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate\naim of the movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters\naccording to the program his present accusers would have given him--of\nnationality, freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover\nthe ground). Let us assume that this program was possible and had then\nbeen formulated, and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then\nhave become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that\nthen prevailed in the government--an activity that in the opinion of\nthe historians was good and beneficent? Their activity would not\nhave existed: there would have been no life, there would have been\nnothing.\n\nIf we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the\npossibility of life is destroyed.');

If the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have\nbeen attained without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the\naim was the dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have\naccomplished that much better than warfare. If the aim was the\nprogress of civilization, it is easy to see that there are other\nways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the\ndestruction of wealth and of human lives.\n\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some other way?\n\nBecause it happened so! \"Chance created the situation; genius\nutilized it,\" says history.\n\nBut what is chance? What is genius?\n\nThe words chance and genius do not denote any really existing\nthing and therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a\ncertain stage of understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a\ncertain event occurs; I think that I cannot know it; so I do not try\nto know it and I talk about chance. I see a force producing effects\nbeyond the scope of ordinary human agencies; I do not understand why\nthis occurs and I talk of genius.\n\nTo a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a\nspecial enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the\nothers must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing\nconjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances\nthat this ram, who instead of getting into the general fold every\nevening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats--that\nthis very ram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat.\n\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to\nthem happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they\nneed only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes\nbeyond their ken, and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence\nin what happened to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not\nknow for what purpose they are fattened, they will at least know\nthat all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally, and\nwill no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius.\n\nOnly by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately\nintelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond\nour ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of\nhistoric characters and perceive the cause of the effect they\nproduce (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then\nthe words chance and genius become superfluous.\n\nWe need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European\nconvulsions and that we know only the facts--that is, the murders,\nfirst in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria,\nin Spain, and in Russia--and that the movements from the west to the\neast and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of\nthese events, and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional\nability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable\nto consider them to be anything but like other men, and we shall not\nbe obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those\nsmall events which made these people what they were, but it will be\nclear that all those small events were inevitable.\n\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall\nclearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for\nany single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it\nis impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down\nto the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than\nNapoleon and Alexander with all their antecedents.');

The commencement of that movement was the movement\nfrom west to east. For the peoples of the west to be able to make\ntheir warlike movement to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they\nshould form themselves into a military group of a size able to\nendure a collision with the warlike military group of the east, (2)\nthat they should abandon all established traditions and customs, and\n(3) that during their military movement they should have at their head\na man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions,\nrobberies, and murders which would have to be committed during that\nmovement.\n\nAnd beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately\nlarge group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions,\nand step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new\ncustoms and traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at\nthe head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all\nthat had to be done.\n\nA man without convictions, without habits, without traditions,\nwithout a name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges--by what seem the\nstrangest chances--from among all the seething French parties, and\nwithout joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent\nposition.\n\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance\nof his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling\nand self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of\nthe army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent\nto Italy, his opponents\' reluctance to fight, and his own childish\naudacity and self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable\nso called chances accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he\nfalls with the rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts\nto avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received\ninto the Russian service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes\nto nothing. During the war in Italy he is several times on the verge\nof destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing\nto various diplomatic considerations the Russian armies--just those\nwhich might have destroyed his prestige--do not appear upon the\nscene till he is no longer there.\n\nOn his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process\nof dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped\nout and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous\nposition presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless\nexpedition to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him.\nImpregnable Malta surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes\nare crowned with success. The enemy\'s fleet, which subsequently did\nnot let a single boat pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In\nAfrica a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost\nunarmed inhabitants. And the men who commit these crimes, especially\ntheir leader, assure themselves that this is admirable, this is\nglory--it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great and is therefore\ngood.\n\nThis ideal of glory and grandeur--which consists not merely in\nconsidering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on\nevery crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible\nsupernatural significance--that ideal, destined to guide this man\nand his associates, had scope for its development in Africa.\nWhatever he does succeeds. The plague does not touch him. The\ncruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. His\nchildishly rash, uncalled-for, and ignoble departure from Africa,\nleaving his comrades in distress, is set down to his credit, and again\nthe enemy\'s fleet twice lets him slip past. When, intoxicated by the\ncrimes he has committed so successfully, he reaches Paris, the\ndissolution of the republican government, which a year earlier might\nhave ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and his presence there\nnow as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to\nexalt him--and though he himself has no plan, he is quite ready for\nhis new role.\n\nHe had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties\nsnatched at him and demanded his participation.\n\nHe alone--with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy\nand Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and\nfrankness in lying--he alone could justify what had to be done.\n\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from\nhis will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his\nmistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and\nthe conspiracy is crowned with success.\n\nHe is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes\nto flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon\nand says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once\nproud and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played\nout, are even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they\nshould have said to destroy him and retain their power.\n\nChance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by\nagreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the\ncharacters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms\nthe character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government;\nchance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him\nbut confirms his power. Chance puts the Duc d\'Enghien in his hands and\nunexpectedly causes him to kill him--thereby convincing the mob more\nforcibly than in any other way that he had the right, since he had the\nmight. Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to\nprepare an expedition against England (which would inevitably have\nruined him) he never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly\nfalls upon Mack and the Austrians, who surrender without a battle.\nChance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance\nall men, not only the French but all Europe--except England which does\nnot take part in the events about to happen--despite their former\nhorror and detestation of his crimes, now recognize his authority, the\ntitle he has given himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which\nseems excellent and reasonable to them all.\n\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement,\nthe western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806,\n1807, and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of\npeople that had formed in France unites into one group with the\npeoples of Central Europe. The strength of the justification of the\nman who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased\nsize of the group. During the ten-year preparatory period this man had\nformed relations with all the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited\nrulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate\nNapoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur. One after another they\nhasten to display their insignificance before him. The King of Prussia\nsends his wife to seek the great man\'s mercy; the Emperor of Austria\nconsiders it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the Caesars\ninto his bed; the Pope, the guardian of all that the nations hold\nsacred, utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man.\nIt is not Napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of\nhis role, so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on\nhimself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to\nhappen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud he commits, which in\nthe mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great\ndeed. The most suitable fete the Germans can devise for him is a\ncelebration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he great, but so are\nhis ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his brothers-in-law.\nEverything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and\nto prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so too\nare the forces.\n\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal--Moscow.\nThat city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the\nopposing armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to\nWagram. But suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which\nhitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of\nsuccesses to the predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of\ninverse chances occur--from the cold in his head at Borodino to the\nsparks which set Moscow on fire, and the frosts--and instead of\ngenius, stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident.\n\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are\nnow not for Napoleon but always against him.\n\nA countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a\nremarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.\nAttempted drives from east to west--similar to the contrary\nmovements of 1805, 1807, and 1809--precede the great westward\nmovement; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous\ndimensions; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe to the\nmovement; the same hesitation midway, and the same increasing rapidity\nas the goal is approached.\n\nParis, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government\nand army are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any\naccount; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again\nan inexplicable chance occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they\nregard as the cause of their sufferings. Deprived of power and\nauthority, his crimes and his craft exposed, he should have appeared\nto them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later--an\noutlawed brigand. But by some strange chance no one perceives this.\nHis part is not yet ended. The man who ten years before and a year\nlater was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two\ndays\' sail from France, which for some reason is presented to him as\nhis dominion, and guards are given to him and millions of money are\npaid him.');

And all this was found in Alexander I; all\nthis had been prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life:\nhis education, his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded\nhim, and by Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.\n\nDuring the national war he was inactive because he was not needed.\nBut as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented\nitself he appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the\nnations of Europe, led them to the goal.\n\nThe goal is reached.

How does he use it?\n\nAlexander I--the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early\nyears had striven only for his people\'s welfare, the originator of the\nliberal innovations in his fatherland--now that he seemed to possess\nthe utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing\nabout the welfare of his peoples--at the time when Napoleon in exile\nwas drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made\nmankind happy had he retained power--Alexander I, having fulfilled his\nmission and feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes\nthe insignificance of that supposed power, turns away from it, and\ngives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises, saying\nonly:\n\n\"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!...

A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of\na male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees in this\nthe purpose of the bee\'s existence. Another, observing the migration\nof plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may say that\nin this lies the purpose of the bee.

And which of us has not weaknesses of his\nown?\"\n\nIt was just when the count\'s affairs had become so involved that\nit was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year\nthat he unexpectedly died.\n\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his\nfather\'s death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and\nwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went\nto Moscow. The state of the count\'s affairs became quite obvious a\nmonth after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of\nsmall debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts\namounted to double the value of the property.\n\nFriends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance.\nBut he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father\'s memory, which\nhe held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and\naccepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the\ndebts.\n\nThe creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague but\npowerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count\'s\ncareless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once.\nAs always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should\nget paid first, and those who like Mitenka held promissory notes given\nthem as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors.\nNicholas was allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed\nto pity the old man--the cause of their losses (if they were\nlosses)--now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had\nvoluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of\ncontracting them.\n\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold\nby auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained\nunpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his\nbrother-in-law Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely\ndue for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the\nremainder, as the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government\nservice.\n\nHe could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel\nat the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold\non life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people\nwho had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil\nservice, he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the\nuniform of which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and Sonya\nto a small house on the Sivtsev Vrazhek.\n\nNatasha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had\nno clear idea of Nicholas\' circumstances. Having borrowed money from\nhis brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from\nhim. His position was the more difficult because with his salary of\ntwelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and\nSonya, but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty.\nThe countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious\nconditions she had been used to from childhood and, unable to\nrealize how hard it was for her son, kept demanding now a carriage\n(which they did not keep) to send for a friend, now some expensive\narticle of food for herself, or wine for her son, or money to buy a\npresent as a surprise for Natasha or Sonya, or for Nicholas himself.\n\nSonya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her\nwhims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their\npoverty from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably\nindebted to Sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly\nadmired her patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.\n\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and\nbecause there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that\npeople are valued for, but little that could have made him love her.\nHe felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had\ntaken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now\nbehaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten\nand could never in any case be renewed.\n\nNicholas\' position became worse and worse. The idea of putting\nsomething aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he\nnot save anything, but to comply with his mother\'s demands he even\nincurred some small debts. He could see no way out of this\nsituation. The idea of marrying some rich woman, which was suggested\nto him by his female relations, was repugnant to him. The other way\nout--his mother\'s death--never entered his head. He wished for nothing\nand hoped for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy\nand stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his\nposition. He tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their\ncommiseration and offensive offers of assistance; he avoided all\ndistraction and recreation, and even at home did nothing but play\ncards with his mother, pace silently up and down the room, and smoke\none pipe after another. He seemed carefully to cherish within\nhimself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his\nposition.');

From\nreports current in town she learned how the Rostovs were situated, and\nhow \"the son has sacrificed himself for his mother,\" as people were\nsaying.\n\n\"I never expected anything else of him,\" said Princess Mary to\nherself, feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her\nfriendly relations with all the Rostovs which had made her almost a\nmember of the family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But\nremembering her relations with Nicholas in Voronezh she was shy\nabout doing so. Making a great effort she did however go to call on\nthem a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow.\n\nNicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess\' room could only\nbe reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure\nas she had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a\ncold, stiff, proud expression she had not seen on it before. He\ninquired about her health, led the way to his mother, and having sat\nthere for five minutes left the room.\n\nWhen the princess came out of the countess\' room Nicholas met her\nagain, and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to\nthe anteroom. To her remarks about his mother\'s health he made no\nreply. \"What\'s that to you? Leave me in peace,\" his looks seemed to\nsay.\n\n\"Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can\'t bear\nthese ladies and all these civilities!\" said he aloud in Sonya\'s\npresence, evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the\nprincess\' carriage had disappeared.\n\n\"Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?\" cried Sonya, hardly able\nto conceal her delight. \"She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!\"\n\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess\nany more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several\ntimes a day.\n\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her,\nexpressed a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored\nwhen she began to talk about her.\n\nNicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the\nprincess, but his silence irritated her.\n\n\"She is a very admirable and excellent young woman,\" said she,\n\"and you must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing\nsomebody, and I think it must be dull for you only seeing us.\"\n\n\"But I don\'t in the least want to, Mamma.\"\n\n\"You used to want to, and now you don\'t. Really I don\'t understand\nyou, my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see\nanyone.\"\n\n\"But I never said I was dull.\"\n\n\"Why, you said yourself you don\'t want even to see her. She is a\nvery admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now\nsuddenly you have got some notion or other in your head. You hide\neverything from me.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Mamma.\"\n\n\"If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now--but I only\nask you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required\nit.... Well, I have asked you, and now I won\'t interfere any more\nsince you have secrets from your mother.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I\'ll go if you wish it.\"\n\n\"It doesn\'t matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.\"\n\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a\npatience, trying to divert his mother\'s attention to another topic.\n\nThe same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and\nthe day after that.\n\nAfter her visit to the Rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception\nby Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been\nright in not wishing to be the first to call.\n\n\"I expected nothing else,\" she told herself, calling her pride to\nher aid. \"I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the\nold lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many\nobligations.\"\n\nBut she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling\nakin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she\nhad firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again and to forget the\nwhole matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position.\nAnd when she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit\nthat it was her relation to Rostov. His cold, polite manner did not\nexpress his feeling for her (she knew that) but it concealed\nsomething, and until she could discover what that something was, she\nfelt that she could not be at ease.\n\nOne day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her\nnephew\'s lessons, she was informed that Rostov had called. With a firm\nresolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she\nsent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\n\nHer first glance at Nicholas\' face told her that he had only come to\nfulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain\nthe tone in which he addressed her.\n\nThey spoke of the countess\' health, of their mutual friends, of\nthe latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety\nhad elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say\ngood-by.\n\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne\'s help the princess had maintained the\nconversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he\nrose, she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and\nher mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so\nlittle happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat\nstill, her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing\nthat he had risen.\n\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her\nabstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again\nlooked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of\nsuffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was\nvaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face\nexpressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could\nthink of nothing to say.\n\n\"Good-by, Princess!\" said he.\n\nShe started, flushed, and sighed deeply.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" she said as if waking up. \"Are you going\nalready, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the\ncountess!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, I\'ll fetch it,\" said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she\nleft the room.\n\nThey both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.\n\n\"Yes, Princess,\" said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, \"it doesn\'t\nseem long ago since we first met at Bogucharovo, but how much water\nhas flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then,\nyet I would give much to bring back that time... but there\'s no\nbringing it back.\"\n\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous\nones as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden\nmeaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said she, \"but you have no reason to regret the past,\nCount. As I understand your present life, I think you will always\nrecall it with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills\nit now...\"\n\n\"I cannot accept your praise,\" he interrupted her hurriedly. \"On the\ncontrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an\ninteresting or cheerful subject.\"\n\nHis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the\nprincess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved,\nand it was to him that she now spoke.\n\n\"I thought you would allow me to tell you this,\" she said. \"I had\ncome so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would\nnot consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,\" and\nsuddenly her voice trembled. \"I don\'t know why,\" she continued,\nrecovering herself, \"but you used to be different, and...\"\n\n\"There are a thousand reasons why,\" laying special emphasis on the\nwhy. \"Thank you, Princess,\" he added softly. \"Sometimes it is hard.\"\n\n\"So that\'s why! That\'s why!\" a voice whispered in Princess Mary\'s\nsoul. \"No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only\nthat handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble,\nresolute, self-sacrificing spirit too,\" she said to herself. \"Yes,\nhe is poor now and I am rich.... Yes, that\'s the only reason....\nYes, were it not for that...\" And remembering his former tenderness,\nand looking now at his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood\nthe cause of his coldness.\n\n\"But why, Count, why?\" she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer\nto him. \"Why? Tell me. You must tell me!\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"I don\'t understand your why, Count,\" she continued, \"but it\'s\nhard for me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of\nour former friendship. And that hurts me.\" There were tears in her\neyes and in her voice. \"I have had so little happiness in life that\nevery loss is hard for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!\" and\nsuddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room.\n\n\"Princess, for God\'s sake!\" he exclaimed, trying to stop her.\n\"Princess!\"\n\nShe turned round.

Nicholas\nwas a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the\nEnglish ones then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical\ntreatises on estate management, disliked factories, the raising of\nexpensive products, and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not\nmake a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate. He\nalways had before his mind\'s eye the estate as a whole and not any\nparticular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes was not the\nnitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor manures, nor\nspecial plows, but that most important agent by which nitrogen,\noxygen, manure, and plow were made effective--the peasant laborer.\nWhen Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its\ndifferent branches, it was the serf who especially attracted his\nattention. The peasant seemed to him not merely a tool, but also a\njudge of farming and an end in himself. At first he watched the serfs,\ntrying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad,\nand only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality\nlearning from them their methods, their manner of speech, and their\njudgment of what was good and bad. Only when he had understood the\npeasants\' tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk their\nlanguage, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt akin to\nthem did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to perform\ntoward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas\' management\nproduced very brilliant results.\n\nGuided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the\nestates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and\ndelegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they\nhad the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before\nanalyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and\ncredit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle\nthe peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He\nkept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not\nallowing the family groups to divide into separate households. He\nwas hard alike on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to\nget them expelled from the commune.\n\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants\' hay and\ncorn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and\nharvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did\nNicholas.\n\nHe disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs--the\n\"drones\" as he called them--and everyone said he spoiled them by his\nlaxity. When a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf,\nespecially if one had to be punished, he always felt undecided and\nconsulted everybody in the house; but when it was possible to have a\ndomestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without\nthe least hesitation. He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the\npeasants. He knew that his every decision would be approved by them\nall with very few exceptions.\n\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to\nmake things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined\nto do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he\nshould or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and\ndefinite in his own mind.\n\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he\nwould say: \"What can one do with our Russian peasants?\" and imagined\nthat he could not bear them.\n\nYet he loved \"our Russian peasants\" and their way of life with his\nwhole soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated\nthe one way and manner of farming which produced good results.\n\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband\'s and\nregretted that she could not share it; but she could not understand\nthe joys and vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote\nand alien. She could not understand why he was so particularly\nanimated and happy when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the\nwhole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor, he returned\nfrom the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her. She did not\nunderstand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the\nfarming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant Matthew Ermishin, who\nwith his family had carted corn all night; or of the fact that his\n(Nicholas\') sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his\nharvest in. She did not understand why he stepped out from the\nwindow to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so\njoyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty\nshoots of the young oats, or why when the wind carried away a\nthreatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the\nbarn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and\ngentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would say:\n\"Well, one more day and my grain and the peasants\' will all be under\ncover.\"\n\nStill less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready\nto anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she\nbrought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed\nto her to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should\nobstinately refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what\nwas not her business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved\npassionately and which had laws she had not fathomed.\n\nSometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work\nhe was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: \"Not in the\nleast; it never entered my head and I wouldn\'t do that for their good!\nThat\'s all poetry and old wives\' talk--all that doing good to one\'s\nneighbor! What I want is that our children should not have to go\nbegging. I must put our affairs in order while I am alive, that\'s all.\nAnd to do that, order and strictness are essential.... That\'s all\nabout it!\" said he, clenching his vigorous fist. \"And fairness, of\ncourse,\" he added, \"for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has\nonly one miserable horse, he can do no good either for himself or\nfor me.\"\n\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitful--probably just because he\nrefused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for\nvirtue\'s sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring\nestates came to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the\nmemory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs.\n\"He was a master... the peasants\' affairs first and then his own. Of\ncourse he was not to be trifled with either--in a word, he was a\nreal master!\"');

At first he saw nothing reprehensible in\nthis, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form\nof punishment suddenly changed.\n\nOnce in summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, a\nman who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused\nof dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the\nporch to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few\nreplies the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch\nNicholas went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over\nher embroidery frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had\nbeen doing that morning. Among other things he spoke of the\nBogucharovo elder. Countess Mary turned red and then pale, but\ncontinued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her\nhusband no reply.\n\n\"Such an insolent scoundrel!\" he cried, growing hot again at the\nmere recollection of him. \"If he had told me he was drunk and did\nnot see... But what is the matter with you, Mary?\" he suddenly asked.\n\nCountess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked\ndown again and her lips puckered.\n\n\"Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?\"\n\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in\ntears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow\nor pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible\ncharm.\n\nThe moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain\nherself and began to cry.\n\n\"Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!\"\nand she covered her face with her hands.\n\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and\npaced up and down the room. He understood what she was weeping\nabout, but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what\nhe had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong.\n\"Is it just sentimentality, old wives\' tales, or is she right?\" he\nasked himself. Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her\nface filled with love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she\nwas right and that he had long been sinning against himself.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said softly, going up to her, \"it will never happen\nagain; I give you my word. Never,\" he repeated in a trembling voice\nlike a boy asking for forgiveness.\n\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess\' eyes. She took\nhis hand and kissed it.\n\n\"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?\" she asked to change the\nsubject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo\nof Laocoon\'s head.\n\n\"Today--it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don\'t remind me of it!\"\nand again he flushed. \"I give you my word of honor it shan\'t occur\nagain, and let this always be a reminder to me,\" and he pointed to the\nbroken ring.\n\nAfter that, when in discussions with his village elders or\nstewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench,\nNicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his\neyes before the man who was making him angry. But he did forget\nhimself once or twice within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and\nconfess to his wife, and would again promise that this should really\nbe the very last time.\n\n\"Mary, you must despise me!\" he would say. \"I deserve it.\"\n\n\"You should go, go away at once, if you don\'t feel strong enough\nto control yourself,\" she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her\nhusband.\n\nAmong the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not\nliked. He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class,\nand consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid.\nThe whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with\nthe work on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the\nsame business like seriousness--leaving home for a month, or even two,\nwith his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his\ntime reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on\nthese he spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he\nsaid, a serious library, and he made it a rule to read through all the\nbooks he bought. He would sit in his study with a grave air,\nreading--a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty, but which\nafterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and\na consciousness of being occupied with serious matters. In winter,\nexcept for business excursions, he spent most of his time at home\nmaking himself one with his family and entering into all the details\nof his children\'s relations with their mother. The harmony between him\nand his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh\nspiritual treasures in her.\n\nFrom the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house. Before\nthat, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself\nand Sonya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess\nMary to be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized\nthe wrong he had done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward her, and\nimagined that her wealth had influenced Nicholas\' choice. She could\nnot find fault with Sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her,\nbut often felt ill-will toward her which she could not overcome.\n\nOnce she had a talk with her friend Natasha about Sonya and about\nher own injustice toward her.\n\n\"You know,\" said Natasha, \"you have read the Gospels a great\ndeal--there is a passage in them that just fits Sonya.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Countess Mary, surprised.\n\n\"\'To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not\nshall be taken away.\' You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I\ndon\'t know. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don\'t know, but from her is\ntaken away, and everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am\ndreadfully sorry for her. Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to\nmarry her, but I always had a sort of presentiment that it would not\ncome off. She is a sterile flower, you know--like some strawberry\nblossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for her, and sometimes I think she\ndoesn\'t feel it as you or I would.\"\n\nThough Countess Mary told Natasha that those words in the Gospel\nmust be understood differently, yet looking at Sonya she agreed with\nNatasha\'s explanation. It really seemed that Sonya did not feel her\nposition trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a\nsterile flower. She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of\nthe family as a whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the\npeople but to the home. She waited on the old countess, petted and\nspoiled the children, was always ready to render the small services\nfor which she had a gift, and all this was unconsciously accepted from\nher with insufficient gratitude.\n\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the\nsame scale as under the old prince.\n\nThe buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more\nthan simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of\nwood, plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished\nwith very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by\ntheir own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was\nspacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for\nvisitors. Whole families of the Rostovs\' and Bolkonskis\' relations\nsometimes came to Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of\nservants and stayed for months. Besides that, four times a year, on\nthe name days and birthdays of the hosts, as many as a hundred\nvisitors would gather there for a day or two. The rest of the year\nlife pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations, and\nits breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided out of the\nproduce of the estate.');

Having taken\nprecautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the\nmorrow because it was a great saint\'s day, he returned to dinner,\nand without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at\nthe long table laid for twenty persons, at which the whole household\nhad assembled. At that table were his mother, his mother\'s old lady\ncompanion Belova, his wife, their three children with their\ngoverness and tutor, his wife\'s nephew with his tutor, Sonya, Denisov,\nNatasha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael\nIvanovich, the late prince\'s architect, who was living on in\nretirement at Bald Hills.\n\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband\ntook his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after\ntaking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass\nstanding before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the\ncase when he came in to dinner straight from the farm--especially\nbefore the soup. Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when\nshe herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had\nhis soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there\nwas no cause for his ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and\nwas hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason, and\nshe felt unhappy. She asked him where he had been. He replied. She\nagain inquired whether everything was going well on the farm. Her\nunnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily.\n\n\"Then I\'m not mistaken,\" thought Countess Mary. \"Why is he cross\nwith me?\" She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and\nwished to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded\nunnatural, but could not refrain from asking some more questions.\n\nThanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became general\nand lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the\ntable and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary\nheld out her hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was\nangry with her.\n\n\"You always have such strange fancies! I didn\'t even think of\nbeing angry,\" he replied.\n\nBut the word always seemed to her to imply: \"Yes, I am angry but I\nwon\'t tell you why.\"\n\nNicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sonya\nand the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to\ndisagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they\nhad their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always\njust after they had been happiest together, they suddenly had a\nfeeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most\nfrequently during Countess Mary\'s pregnancies, and this was such a\ntime.\n\n\"Well, messieurs et mesdames,\" said Nicholas loudly and with\napparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on\npurpose to vex her), \"I have been on my feet since six this morning.\nTomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today I\'ll go and rest.\"\n\nAnd without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room\nand lay down on the sofa.\n\n\"That\'s always the way,\" thought Countess Mary. \"He talks to\neveryone except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him,\nespecially when I am in this condition.\" She looked down at her\nexpanded figure and in the glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face\nin which her eyes now looked larger than ever.\n\nAnd everything annoyed her--Denisov\'s shouting and laughter,\nNatasha\'s talk, and especially a quick glance Sonya gave her.\n\nSonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling\nirritated.\n\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything\nof what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the\nnursery.\n\nThe children were playing at \"going to Moscow\" in a carriage made of\nchairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with\nthem a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable\ncrossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with\ndifficulty, went to the small sitting room.\n\n\"Perhaps he is not asleep; I\'ll have an explanation with him,\" she\nsaid to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his\nmother, followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.\n\n\"Mary, dear, I think he is asleep--he was so tired,\" said Sonya,\nmeeting her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that\nshe crossed her path everywhere). \"Andrew may wake him.\"\n\nCountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt\nthat Sonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with\nevident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made\nno reply, but to avoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew to follow\nher quietly and went to the door. Sonya went away by another door.\nFrom the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his\neven breathing, every slightest tone of which was familiar to his\nwife. As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome\nforehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so often seen\nit in the stillness of the night when he slept. Nicholas suddenly\nmoved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted\nfrom outside the door: \"Papa! Mamma\'s standing here!\" Countess Mary\nturned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and\nquiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how\nNicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard\nNicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice said\ncrossly:\n\n\"I can\'t get a moment\'s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you\nbring him here?\"\n\n\"I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me...\"\n\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the\ndoor and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little\nblack-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father\'s pet, having learned\nfrom her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting\nroom, ran to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little\ngirl boldly opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with\nenergetic steps of her sturdy little legs, and having examined the\nposition of her father, who was asleep with his back to her, rose on\ntiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head. Nicholas turned\nwith a tender smile on his face.\n\n\"Natasha, Natasha!\" came Countess Mary\'s frightened whisper from the\ndoor. \"Papa wants to sleep.\"\n\n\"No, Mamma, he doesn\'t want to sleep,\" said little Natasha with\nconviction. \"He\'s laughing.\"\n\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.\n\n\"Come in, Mary,\" he said to his wife.\n\nShe went in and sat down by her husband.\n\n\"I did not notice him following me,\" she said timidly. \"I just\nlooked in.\"\n\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife\nand, seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and\nkissed her hair.\n\n\"May I kiss Mamma?\" he asked Natasha.\n\nNatasha smiled bashfully.\n\n\"Again!\" she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the\nspot where Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n\n\"I don\'t know why you think I am cross,\" said Nicholas, replying\nto the question he knew was in his wife\'s mind.\n\n\"You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are\nlike that. It always seems to me...\"\n\n\"Mary, don\'t talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" he\nsaid gaily.\n\n\"It seems to be that you can\'t love me, that I am so plain...\nalways... and now... in this cond...\"\n\n\"Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it\'s love\nthat makes us see beauty. It is only Malvinas and women of that kind\nwho are loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don\'t love\nher, but... I don\'t know how to put it. Without you, or when something\ncomes between us like this, I seem lost and can\'t do anything. Now\ndo I love my finger? I don\'t love it, but just try to cut it off!\"\n\n\"I\'m not like that myself, but I understand. So you\'re not angry\nwith me?\"\n\n\"Awfully angry!\" he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing\nhis hair he began to pace the room.\n\n\"Do you know, Mary, what I\'ve been thinking?\" he began,\nimmediately thinking aloud in his wife\'s presence now that they had\nmade it up.\n\nHe did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A\nthought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he\ntold her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till\nspring.\n\nCountess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and\nin her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the\nchildren.\n\n\"You can see the woman in her already,\" she said in French, pointing\nto little Natasha. \"You reproach us women with being illogical. Here\nis our logic. I say: \'Papa wants to sleep!\' but she says, \'No, he\'s\nlaughing.\' And she was right,\" said Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\" And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong\nhand, lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the\nlegs, and paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree\nhappiness on the faces of both father and daughter.\n\n\"But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,\"\nhis wife whispered in French.\n\n\"Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...\"\n\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps\nin the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.\n\n\"Somebody has come.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,\" said Countess Mary\nand left the room.\n\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little\ndaughter a gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the\nlaughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart.\nHis capers reminded him of dancing, and looking at the child\'s round\nhappy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was\nan old man, taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her\nas his old father had danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.\n\n\"It is he, it is he, Nicholas!\" said Countess Mary, re-entering\nthe room a few minutes later. \"Now our Natasha has come to life. You\nshould have seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed\naway so long. Well, come along now, quick, quick! It\'s time you two\nwere parted,\" she added, looking smilingly at the little girl who\nclung to her father.\n\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\n\nCountess Mary remained in the sitting room.\n\n\"I should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,\"\nshe whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time\nshe sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though\nshe felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of\nhappiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily\nthought at that instant.');

She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was\ndifficult to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively\nNatasha of former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm,\nsoft, and serene expression. In her face there was none of the\never-glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted\nits charm. Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her\nsoul was not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong,\nhandsome, and fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her\nface now. That happened only when, as was the case that day, her\nhusband returned home, or a sick child was convalescent, or when she\nand Countess Mary spoke of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to\nher husband, who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew\'s memory),\nor on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to\nsing, a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage. At the\nrare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully\ndeveloped body she was even more attractive than in former days.\n\nSince their marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in\nPetersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is\nto say, in Nicholas\' house. The young Countess Bezukhova was not often\nseen in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her\nand found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked\nsolitude--she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even\nthought that she did not--but with her pregnancies, her\nconfinements, the nursing of her children, and sharing every moment of\nher husband\'s life, she had demands on her time which could be\nsatisfied only by renouncing society. All who had known Natasha before\nher marriage wondered at the change in her as at something\nextraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had\nrealized that all Natasha\'s outbursts had been due to her need of\nchildren and a husband--as she herself had once exclaimed at\nOtradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest--and her mother was now\nsurprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never\nunderstood Natasha, and she kept saying that she had always known that\nNatasha would make an exemplary wife and mother.\n\n\"Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all\nbounds,\" said the countess, \"so that it even becomes absurd.\"\n\nNatasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,\nespecially by the French, which says that a girl should not let\nherself go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments,\nshould be even more careful of her appearance than when she was\nunmarried, and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before\nhe became her husband. Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned\nall her witchery, of which her singing had been an unusually powerful\npart. She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive. She\ntook no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her\ntoilet, or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming\nattitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She\nacted in contradiction to all those rules. She felt that the\nallurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be\nmerely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, to whom she had from the\nfirst moment given herself up entirely--that is, with her whole soul,\nleaving no corner of it hidden from him. She felt that her unity with\nher husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had\nattracted him to her, but by something else--indefinite but firm as\nthe bond between her own body and soul.\n\nTo fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing\nromantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange\nas to adorn herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others\nmight perhaps have been agreeable--she did not know--but she had no\ntime at all for it. The chief reason for devoting no time either to\nsinging, to dress, or to choosing her words was that she really had no\ntime to spare for these things.\n\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed\nin a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject\nso trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one\'s\nentire attention is devoted to it.\n\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Natasha\'s attention was her\nfamily: that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should\nbelong entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she\nhad to bear, bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.\n\nAnd the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her\nwhole soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the\nlarger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did\nher powers appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one\nthing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered\nnecessary.\n\nThere were then as now conversations and discussions about women\'s\nrights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and\nrights, though these themes were not yet termed questions as they\nare now; but these topics were not merely uninteresting to Natasha,\nshe positively did not understand them.\n\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing\nin marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that\nis, only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance,\nwhich lies in the family.\n\nDiscussions and questions of that kind, which are like the\nquestion of how to get the greatest gratification from one\'s dinner,\ndid not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of\na dinner is the nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is\nthe family.\n\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats\ntwo dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain\nhis purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.\n\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to\nhave many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in\nthat case will not have a family.\n\nIf the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is\nthe family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more\nthan one can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are\nneeded for the family--that is, one wife or one husband. Natasha\nneeded a husband. A husband was given her and he gave her a family.\nAnd she not only saw no need of any other or better husband, but as\nall the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and\nfamily, she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how\nit would be if things were different.\n\nNatasha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the\nsociety of her relatives--Countess Mary, and her brother, her\nmother, and Sonya. She valued the company of those to whom she could\ncome striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and\nwith joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby\'s\nnapkin, and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect\nthat baby was much better.\n\nTo such an extent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed\nand did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy--she was\njealous of Sonya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or\nplain--were habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general\nopinion was that Pierre was under his wife\'s thumb, which was really\ntrue. From the very first days of their married life Natasha had\nannounced her demands. Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife\'s\nview, to him a perfectly novel one, that every moment of his life\nbelonged to her and to the family. His wife\'s demands astonished him,\nbut they also flattered him, and he submitted to them.\n\nPierre\'s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not\nflirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman;\ndid not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money\non a whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time,\nexcept on business--in which his wife included his intellectual\npursuits, which she did not in the least understand but to which she\nattributed great importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had\nthe right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as\nhe chose. At home Natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to\nher husband, and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was\noccupied--that is, was reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but\nto show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done\nalways. He had only to express a wish and Natasha would jump up and\nrun to fulfill it.\n\nThe entire household was governed according to Pierre\'s supposed\norders, that is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their way\nof life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties,\nNatasha\'s occupations, the children\'s upbringing, were all selected\nnot merely with regard to Pierre\'s expressed wishes, but to what\nNatasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his\nwishes to be. And she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite\ncorrectly, and having once arrived at them clung to them\ntenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would\nfight him with his own weapons.\n\nThus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of\ntheir first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet\nnurse three times and Natasha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day\ntold her of Rousseau\'s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have\na wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born,\ndespite the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her\nhusband himself--who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her\nbaby herself, a thing then unheard of and considered injurious--she\ninsisted on having her own way, and after that nursed all her babies\nherself.\n\nIt very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and\nwife would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his\nsurprise and delight would find in his wife\'s ideas and actions the\nvery thought against which she had argued, but divested of\neverything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had\nadded when expressing his opinion.\n\nAfter seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm\nconsciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he\nsaw himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within\nhimself inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really\ngood in him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was\nrejected. And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a\ndirect and mysterious reflection.');

She attributed immense\nimportance to all her husband\'s intellectual and abstract interests\nthough she did not understand them, and she always dreaded being a\nhindrance to him in such matters. To Pierre\'s timid look of inquiry\nafter reading the letter she replied by asking him to go, but to fix a\ndefinite date for his return. He was given four weeks\' leave of\nabsence.\n\nEver since that leave of absence had expired, more than a\nfortnight before, Natasha had been in a constant state of alarm,\ndepression, and irritability.\n\nDenisov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied\nwith the present state of affairs, had arrived during that\nfortnight. He looked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad\nlikeness of a person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies,\nand talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former\nenchantress.\n\nNatasha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her\nmother, her brother, Sonya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to\nconsole her tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay\nin returning.\n\n\"It\'s all nonsense, all rubbish--those discussions which lead to\nnothing and all those idiotic societies!\" Natasha declared of the very\naffairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.\n\nAnd she would go to the nursery to nurse Petya, her only boy. No one\nelse could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this\nlittle three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she\nwas conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his\nlittle nose. That creature said: \"You are angry, you are jealous,\nyou would like to pay him out, you are afraid--but here am I! And I am\nhe...\" and that was unanswerable. It was more than true.\n\nDuring that fortnight of anxiety Natasha resorted to the baby for\ncomfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him\nand he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was\njust what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety\nabout her husband more easily.\n\nShe was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre\'s sleigh was\nheard at the front door, and the old nurse--knowing how to please\nher mistress--entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a\nbeaming face.\n\n\"Has he come?\" Natasha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move\nlest she should rouse the dozing baby.\n\n\"He\'s come, ma\'am,\" whispered the nurse.\n\nThe blood rushed to Natasha\'s face and her feet involuntarily moved,\nbut she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his\neyes and looked at her. \"You\'re here?\" he seemed to be saying, and\nagain lazily smacked his lips.\n\nCautiously withdrawing her breast, Natasha rocked him a little,\nhanded him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door.\nBut at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for\nhaving in her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round.\nThe nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of\nhis cot.\n\n\"Go, ma\'am! Don\'t worry, go!\" she whispered, smiling, with the\nkind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.\n\nNatasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.\n\nDenisov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with\nhis pipe, now for the first time recognized the old Natasha. A flood\nof brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.\n\n\"He\'s come!\" she exclaimed as she ran past, and Denisov felt that he\ntoo was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had\nreturned.\n\nOn reaching the vestibule Natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat\nunwinding his scarf. \"It\'s he! It\'s really he! He has come!\" she\nsaid to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head\nto her breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy,\nhappy face, covered with hoarfrost. \"Yes, it is he, happy and\ncontented...\"\n\nThen all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had\nexperienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her\nface vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of\nreproaches and angry words.\n\n\"Yes, it\'s all very well for you. You are pleased, you\'ve had a good\ntime.... But what about me? You might at least have shown\nconsideration for the children. I am nursing and my milk was\nspoiled.... Petya was at death\'s door. But you were enjoying yourself.\nYes, enjoying...\"\n\nPierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come\nsooner; he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a\nminute or two; above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy.\nHe wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a\npiteous, frightened face and bent down.\n\n\"I could not, on my honor. But how is Petya?\"\n\n\"All right now. Come along! I wonder you\'re not ashamed! If only you\ncould see what I was like without you, how I suffered!\"\n\n\"You are well?\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went\nto their rooms.\n\nWhen Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the\nnursery holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right\npalm and dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby\'s\nbroad face with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since\nover and there was bright, joyous sunshine on Natasha\'s face as she\ngazed tenderly at her husband and child.\n\n\"And have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Yes, capitally.\"\n\n\"You see, he holds it up.\" (She meant the baby\'s head.) \"But how\nhe did frighten me... You\'ve seen the princess? Is it true she\'s in\nlove with that...\"\n\n\"Yes, just fancy...\"\n\nAt that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the\nbaby on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries.\nBut in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the\nbaby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all\nhis attention.\n\n\"How sweet!\" said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the\nbaby. \"Now, Nicholas,\" she added, turning to her husband, \"I can\'t\nunderstand how it is you don\'t see the charm of these delicious\nmarvels.\"\n\n\"I don\'t and can\'t,\" replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby.\n\"A lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!\"\n\n\"And yet he\'s such an affectionate father,\" said Countess Mary,\nvindicating her husband, \"but only after they are a year old or so...\"\n\n\"Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly,\" said Natasha. \"He says his\nhand is just made for a baby\'s seat. Just look!\"\n\n\"Only not for this...\" Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and\nshifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.');

He alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise (his only\npiece) to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced,\nand they felt sure he had brought presents for them all.\n\nYoung Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,\nwith curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted\nbecause Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his\nrapturous and passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this\nlove for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had\nbrought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she\nloved him, and little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him\nwith just a shade of contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did\nnot want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle\nNicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In\nPierre\'s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed\nand was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a\nsingle word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by\nhimself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had\nsaid. Pierre\'s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which\nyoung Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he\nhad overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Platon\nKarataev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Natasha\n(of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially\nPierre\'s friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not\nremember--all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.\n\nFrom broken remarks about Natasha and his father, from the emotion\nwith which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful,\nreverent tenderness with which Natasha spoke of him, the boy, who\nwas only just beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that\nhis father had loved Natasha and when dying had left her to his\nfriend. But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a\ndivinity who could not be pictured, and of whom he never thought\nwithout a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture. So the\nboy also was happy that Pierre had arrived.\n\nThe guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and\nunite any company he was in.\n\nThe grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were\npleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more\nsmoothly and peacefully.\n\nThe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and\nespecially that Natasha would now be herself again.\n\nPierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and\nmade haste to satisfy all their expectations.\n\nThough the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the\naid of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not\nforgetting his mother--and brother-in-law\'s commissions, nor the dress\nmaterial for a present to Belova, nor toys for his wife\'s nephews.\nIn the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that\nhis wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things\nhe undertook to buy, and he had been taken aback by her serious\nannoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything. But in time\nhe grew used to this demand. Knowing that Natasha asked nothing for\nherself, and gave him commissions for others only when he himself\nhad offered to undertake them, he now found an unexpected and\nchildlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the\nhouse, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred Natasha\'s censure\nit was only for buying too many and too expensive things. To her other\ndefects (as most people thought them, but which to Pierre were\nqualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now added\nstinginess.\n\nFrom the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing\nentailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he\nspent only half as much as before, and that his affairs--which had\nbeen in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife\'s\ndebts--had begun to improve.\n\nLife was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive\nluxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no\nlonger his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had\nnow been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not\nin his power, and so that way of life proved economical.\n\nWith a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.\n\n\"What do you think of this?\" said he, unrolling a piece of stuff\nlike a shopman.\n\nNatasha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on\nher lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the\nthings he showed her.\n\n\"That\'s for Belova? Excellent!\" She felt the quality of the\nmaterial. \"It was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?\"\n\nPierre told her the price.\n\n\"Too dear!\" Natasha remarked. \"How pleased the children will be\nand Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,\" she added,\nunable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb\nset with pearls, of a kind then just coming into fashion.\n\n\"Adele tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,\" returned\nPierre.\n\n\"When am I to wear it?\" and Natasha stuck it in her coil of hair.\n\"When I take little Masha into society? Perhaps they will be\nfashionable again by then. Well, let\'s go now.\"\n\nAnd collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and\nthen to the old countess\' rooms.\n\nThe countess was sitting with her companion Belova, playing\ngrand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Natasha came into the drawing\nroom with parcels under their arms.\n\nThe countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with\na frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper\nlip had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.\n\nAfter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession,\nshe felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left\nwithout aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or\nkept awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She\nwanted nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity\nonly death could give her. But until death came she had to go on\nliving, that is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in\nvery young children and very old people was particularly evident in\nher. Her life had no external aims--only a need to exercise her\nvarious functions and inclinations was apparent. She had to eat,\nsleep, think, speak, weep, work, give vent to her anger, and so on,\nmerely because she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a\nliver. She did these things not under any external impulse as people\nin the full vigor of life do, when behind the purpose for which they\nstrive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed. She\ntalked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and\nlungs. She cried as a child does, because her nose had to be\ncleared, and so on. What for people in their full vigor is an aim\nwas for her evidently merely a pretext.\n\nThus in the morning--especially if she had eaten anything rich the\nday before--she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the\nhandiest pretext Belova\'s deafness.\n\nShe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other\nend of the room.\n\n\"It seems a little warmer today, my dear,\" she would murmur.\n\nAnd when Belova replied: \"Oh yes, they\'ve come,\" she would mutter\nangrily: \"O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!\"\n\nAnother pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or\ntoo damp or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability\nher face would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible\nsymptoms when Belova would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the\ncountess\' face yellow. Just as she needed to work off her spleen so\nshe had sometimes to exercise her still-existing faculty of\nthinking--and the pretext for that was a game of patience. When she\nneeded to cry, the deceased count would be the pretext. When she\nwanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health would be the pretext,\nand when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the pretext would be\nCountess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise, which was\nusually toward seven o\'clock when she had had an after-dinner rest\nin a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same\nstories over and over again to the same audience.\n\nThe old lady\'s condition was understood by the whole household\nthough no one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible\neffort to satisfy her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a\nsad smile between Nicholas, Pierre, Natasha, and Countess Mary was the\ncommon understanding of her condition expressed.\n\nBut those glances expressed something more: they said that she had\nplayed her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole\nself, that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to\nyield to her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being\nformerly as full of life as themselves, but now so much to be\npitied. \"Memento mori,\" said these glances.\n\nOnly the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and\nthe little children failed to understand this and avoided her.');

We were all weary of\nwaiting for you. Well, thank God!\" and received her presents with\nanother customary remark: \"It\'s not the gift that\'s precious, my dear,\nbut that you give it to me, an old woman...\"--yet it was evident\nthat she was not pleased by Pierre\'s arrival at that moment when it\ndiverted her attention from the unfinished game.\n\nShe finished her game of patience and only then examined the\npresents. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid\nworkmanship, a bright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses\ndepicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count\'s\nportrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in\nPetersburg. The countess had long wished for such a box, but as she\ndid not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the\nportrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,\" said she as she always\ndid. \"But best of all you have brought yourself back--for I never\nsaw anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are\nwe to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away.\nDoesn\'t see anything, doesn\'t remember anything,\" she went on,\nrepeating her usual phrases. \"Look, Anna Timofeevna,\" she added to her\ncompanion, \"see what a box for cards my son has brought us!\"\n\nBelova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress\nmaterial.\n\nThough Pierre, Natasha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denisov had\nmuch to talk about that they could not discuss before the old\ncountess--not that anything was hidden from her, but because she had\ndropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to\nconverse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune\nquestions and to repeat what they had already told her many times:\nthat so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married, which she would\nagain be unable to remember--yet they sat at tea round the samovar\nin the drawing room from habit, and Pierre answered the countess\'\nquestions as to whether Prince Vasili had aged and whether Countess\nMary Alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them, and other\nmatters that interested no one and to which she herself was\nindifferent.\n\nConversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,\ncontinued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the\nfamily were assembled near the round tea table at which Sonya presided\nbeside the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had\nhad tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all\nsat in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small\ntable where his tea was handed to him; Milka, the old gray borzoi\nbitch (daughter of the first Milka), with a quite gray face and\nlarge black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the\narmchair beside him; Denisov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers\nhad turned half gray, sat beside countess Mary with his general\'s\ntunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He\nspoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could\nunderstand. He told her of external social events and of the people\nwho had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a\nreal, living, and distinct group, but who were now for the most part\nscattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last\nears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years. But to the old\ncountess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious\nand real society. Natasha saw by Pierre\'s animation that his visit had\nbeen interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it\nbefore the old countess. Denisov, not being a member of the family,\ndid not understand Pierre\'s caution and being, as a malcontent, much\ninterested in what was occurring in Petersburg, kept urging Pierre\nto tell them about what had happened in the Semenovsk regiment, then\nabout Arakcheev, and then about the Bible Society. Once or twice\nPierre was carried away and began to speak of these things, but\nNicholas and Natasha always brought him back to the health of Prince\nIvan and Countess Mary Alexeevna.\n\n\"Well, and all this idiocy--Gossner and Tatawinova?\" Denisov\nasked. \"Is that weally still going on?\"\n\n\"Going on?\" Pierre exclaimed. \"Why more than ever! The Bible Society\nis the whole government now!\"\n\n \"What is that, mon cher ami?\" asked the countess, who had\nfinished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry\nafter her meal. \"What are you saying about the government? I don\'t\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, Maman,\" Nicholas interposed, knowing how to\ntranslate things into his mother\'s language, \"Prince Alexander\nGolitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence,\nthey say.\"\n\n\"Arakcheev and Golitsyn,\" incautiously remarked Pierre, \"are now the\nwhole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere\nand are afraid of everything.\"\n\n\"Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most\nestimable man. I used to meet him at Mary Antonovna\'s,\" said the\ncountess in an offended tone; and still more offended that they all\nremained silent, she went on: \"Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel\nSociety! Well, and what harm is there in that?\" and she rose\n(everybody else got up too) and with a severe expression sailed back\nto her table in the sitting room.\n\nThe melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the\nchildren\'s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some\njolly excitement was going on there.\n\n\"Finished, finished!\" little Natasha\'s gleeful yell rose above\nthem all.\n\nPierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natasha he\nnever lost sight of) and smiled happily.\n\n\"That\'s delightful music!\" said he.\n\n\"It means that Anna Makarovna has finished her stocking,\" said\nCountess Mary.\n\n\"Oh, I\'ll go and see,\" said Pierre, jumping up. \"You know,\" he\nadded, stopping at the door, \"why I\'m especially fond of that music?\nIt is always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was\ndriving here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I\ngrew. As I entered the anteroom I heard Andrusha\'s peals of laughter\nand that meant that all was well.\"\n\n\"I know! I know that feeling,\" said Nicholas. \"But I mustn\'t go\nthere--those stockings are to be a surprise for me.\"\n\nPierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew\nstill louder.\n\n\"Come, Anna Makarovna,\" Pierre\'s voice was heard saying, \"come here\ninto the middle of the room and at the word of command, \'One, two,\'\nand when I say \'three\'... You stand here, and you in my arms--well\nnow! One, two!...\" said Pierre, and a silence followed: \"three!\" and a\nrapturously breathless cry of children\'s voices filled the room. \"Two,\ntwo!\" they shouted.\n\nThis meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to\nherself Anna Makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same\nneedles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly\ndrew, one out of the other, in the children\'s presence.');

They\nkissed everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and\nthey went out. Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles\nwhispered to the boy to come downstairs.\n\n\"No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,\" replied\nNicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper.\n\n\"Ma tante, please let me stay,\" said he, going up to his aunt.\n\nHis face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary\nglanced at him and turned to Pierre.\n\n\"When you are here he can\'t tear himself away,\" she said.\n\n\"I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good\nnight!\" said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned\nto young Nicholas with a smile. \"You and I haven\'t seen anything of\none another yet... How like he is growing, Mary!\" he added, addressing\nCountess Mary.\n\n\"Like my father?\" asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up\nat Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.\n\nPierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the\nchildren had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork;\nNatasha did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denisov\nrose, asked for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from\nSonya--who sat weary but resolute at the samovar--and questioned\nPierre. The curly-headed, delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed\nin a corner, starting every now and then and muttering something to\nhimself, and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he\nturned his curly head, with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down\ncollar, toward the place where Pierre sat.\n\nThe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in\npower, in which most people see the chief interest of home politics.\nDenisov, dissatisfied with the government on account of his own\ndisappointments in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done\nin Petersburg which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and\nsharp comments on what Pierre told them.\n\n\"One used to have to be a German--now one must dance with Tatawinova\nand Madame Kwudener, and wead Ecka\'tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they\nshould let that fine fellow Bonaparte lose--he\'d knock all this\nnonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Semenov wegiment\nto a fellow like that Schwa\'tz!\" he cried.\n\nNicholas, though free from Denisov\'s readiness to find fault with\neverything, also thought that discussion of the government was a\nvery serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been\nappointed Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that\nthe Emperor had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed\nto him very important. And so he thought it necessary to take an\ninterest in these things and to question Pierre. The questions put\nby these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary\ncharacter of gossip about the higher government circles.\n\nBut Natasha, knowing all her husband\'s ways and ideas, saw that he\nhad long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation\nto another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake\nof which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend\nPrince Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with\nPrince Theodore had gone.\n\n\"What was it about?\" asked Nicholas.\n\n\"Always the same thing,\" said Pierre, looking round at his\nlisteners. \"Everybody sees that things are going so badly that they\ncannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent\nmen to counteract it as far as they can.\"\n\n\"What can decent men do?\" Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly.\n\"What can be done?\"\n\n\"Why, this...\"\n\n\"Come into my study,\" said Nicholas.\n\nNatasha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby,\nnow heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary\nfollowed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas\nBolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the\nwriting table in a shady corner by the window.\n\n\"Well, what would you do?\" asked Denisov.\n\n\"Always some fantastic schemes,\" said Nicholas.\n\n\"Why this,\" began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,\nsometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: \"the position in\nPetersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He has\nabandoned himself altogether to this mysticism\" (Pierre could not\ntolerate mysticism in anyone now). \"He seeks only for peace, and\nonly these people sans foi ni loi* can give it him--people who\nrecklessly hack at and strangle everything--Magnitski, Arakcheev,\nand tutti quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after\nyour estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your\nsteward was the more readily your object might be attained,\" he said\nto Nicholas.\n\n\n*Without faith or law.\n\n\n\"Well, what does that lead up to?\" said Nicholas.\n\n\"Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in\nthe army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the\npeople are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young\nand honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on.\nEverything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,\"\nsaid Pierre (as those who examine the actions of any government have\nalways said since governments began). \"I told them just one thing in\nPetersburg.\"\n\n\"Told whom?\"\n\n\"Well, you know whom,\" said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under\nhis brows. \"Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and\nphilanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in\nthe present circumstances something else is needed.\"\n\nAt that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face\ndarkened and he went up to the boy.\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"Why? Let him be,\" said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and\ncontinuing. \"That is not enough, I told them. Something else is\nneeded. When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at\nany moment, when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe,\nas many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to\nwithstand the general calamity. Everything that is young and strong is\nbeing enticed away and depraved. One is lured by women, another by\nhonors, a third by ambition or money, and they go over to that camp.\nNo independent men, such as you or I, are left. What I say is widen\nthe scope of our society, let the mot d\'ordre be not virtue alone\nbut independence and action as well!\"\n\nNicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an\narmchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing\ndiscontentedly and frowning more and more.\n\n\"But action with what aim?\" he cried. \"And what position will you\nadopt toward the government?\"\n\n\"Why, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret\nif the government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to\ngovernment, but it is a society of true conservatives--a society of\ngentlemen in the full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some\nPugachev or other from killing my children and yours, and Arakcheev\nfrom sending me off to some Military Settlement. We join hands only\nfor the public welfare and the general safety.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it\'s a secret society and therefore a hostile and\nharmful one which can only cause harm.\"\n\n\"Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe\" (they did not then\nventure to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) \"do any harm? The\nTugendbund is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it\nis what Christ preached on the Cross.\"\n\nNatasha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at\nher husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her--that\ndid not even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely\nsimple and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her\nbecause she knew that it sprang from Pierre\'s whole soul), but it\nwas his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.\n\nThe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down\ncollar--whom everyone had forgotten--gazed at Pierre with even greater\nand more rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre\'s burned into his heart,\nand with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the\nsealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle\'s table.\n\n\"It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German\nTugendbund was, and what I am proposing.\"\n\n\"No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage\neaters, but I don\'t understand it and can\'t even pwonounce it,\"\ninterposed Denisov in a loud and resolute voice. \"I agwee that\nevewything here is wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don\'t\nunderstand. If we\'re not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own.\nThat\'s all wight. Je suis vot\'e homme!\"*\n\n\n*\"I\'m your man.\"\n\n\nPierre smiled, Natasha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his\nbrows still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no\nprospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of\nexisted only in his imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and\nas his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas\nfelt himself cornered. This made him still angrier, for he was fully\nconvinced, not by reasoning but by something within him stronger\nthan reason, of the justice of his opinion.\n\n\"I will tell you this,\" he said, rising and trying with nervously\ntwitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally\nabandoning the attempt. \"I can\'t prove it to you. You say that\neverything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don\'t see\nit. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional\nmatter, and to that I reply: \'You are my best friend, as you know, but\nif you formed a secret society and began working against the\ngovernment--be it what it may--I know it is my duty to obey the\ngovernment. And if Arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you\nand cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.\'\nAnd you may argue about that as you like!\"\n\nAn awkward silence followed these words. Natasha was the first to\nspeak, defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense\nwas weak and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was\nresumed, and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas\'\nlast remark.\n\nWhen they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkonski\nwent up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.\n\n\"Uncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree\nwith you?\" he asked.\n\nAnd Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex,\nand powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in\nthis boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said\nhe regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to\ngive him an answer.\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" he said reluctantly, and left the study.\n\nThe lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what\nhe had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to\nNicholas.\n\n\"Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,\" he said,\npointing to the broken sealing wax and pens.\n\nNicholas started angrily.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" he said, throwing the bits under the table.\n\nAnd evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned\naway from the boy.\n\n\"You ought not to have been here at all,\" he said.');

The family separated on the most friendly\nterms.\n\nAfter supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given\ninstructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to\nthe bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her\ntable, writing.\n\n\"What are you writing, Mary?\" Nicholas asked.\n\nCountess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing\nwould not be understood or approved by her husband.\n\nShe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at\nthe same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would\nnow have to tell him.\n\n\"A diary, Nicholas,\" she replied, handing him a blue exercise book\nfilled with her firm, bold writing.\n\n\"A diary?\" Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up\nthe book.\n\nIt was in French.\n\n\nDecember 4. Today when Andrusha (her eldest boy) woke up he did\nnot wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was\nnaughty and obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier.

For a long time he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped\nout of bed, ran to me in his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not\ncalm him for a long time. It was plain that what troubled him most was\nthat he had grieved me. Afterwards in the evening when I gave him\nhis ticket, he again began crying piteously and kissing me. One can do\nanything with him by tenderness.\n\n\n\"What is a \'ticket\'?\" Nicholas inquired.\n\n\"I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how\nthey have behaved.\"\n\nNicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and\ncontinued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down\neverything in the children\'s lives that seemed noteworthy to their\nmother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections\non educational methods. They were for the most part quite\ninsignificant trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the\nfather either, now that he read this diary about his children for\nthe first time.\n\nUnder the date \"5\" was entered:\n\n\nMitya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding.\nHe had none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others\nwhile they were eating! I think that punishment by depriving\nchildren of sweets only develops their greediness. Must tell\nNicholas this.\n\n\nNicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant\neyes gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her\ndiary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of\nhis admiration for his wife.\n\nPerhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or\neven done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of\nwhich the sole aim was the children\'s moral welfare delighted him. Had\nNicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that\nhis steady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling\nof wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost\nbeyond his reach, in which she had her being.\n\nHe was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own\ninsignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the\nmore that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part\nof himself.\n\n\"I quite, quite approve, my dearest!\" said he with a significant\nlook, and after a short pause he added: \"And I behaved badly today.\nYou weren\'t in the study. We began disputing--Pierre and I--and I lost\nmy temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don\'t know what would\nbecome of him if Natasha didn\'t keep him in hand.... Have you any idea\nwhy he went to Petersburg? They have formed...\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Countess Mary. \"Natasha told me.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you know,\" Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere\nrecollection of their discussion, \"he wanted to convince me that it is\nevery honest man\'s duty to go against the government, and that the\noath of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren\'t there. They\nall fell on me--Denisov and Natasha... Natasha is absurd. How she\nrules over him! And yet there need only be a discussion and she has no\nwords of her own but only repeats his sayings...\" added Nicholas,\nyielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge\nthose nearest and dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying\nabout Natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in\nrelation to his wife.\n\n\"Yes, I have noticed that,\" said Countess Mary.\n\n\"When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he\nstarted proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there--what\nwould you have said?\"\n\n\"As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natasha so. Pierre\nsays everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that\nit is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,\"\nsaid Countess Mary, \"but he forgets that we have other duties nearer\nto us, duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might\nexpose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.\"\n\n\"Yes, that\'s it! That\'s just what I said to him,\" put in Nicholas,\nwho fancied he really had said it. \"But they insisted on their own\nview: love of one\'s neighbor and Christianity--and all this in the\npresence of young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all\nmy things.\"\n\n\"Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little\nNicholas,\" said Countess Mary. \"He is such an exceptional boy. I am\nafraid I neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and\nrelations while he has no one. He is constantly alone with his\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"Well, I don\'t think you need reproach yourself on his account.\nAll that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are\ndoing for him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine\nlad! This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and\nfancy--as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken\neverything on my table to bits, and he told me of it himself at\nonce! I never knew him to tell an untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!\"\nrepeated Nicholas, who at heart was not fond of Nicholas Bolkonski but\nwas always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad.\n\n\"Still, I am not the same as his own mother,\" said Countess Mary. \"I\nfeel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am\ndreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have\ncompanions.\"\n\n\"Well it won\'t be for long. Next summer I\'ll take him to\nPetersburg,\" said Nicholas. \"Yes, Pierre always was a dreamer and\nalways will be,\" he continued, returning to the talk in the study\nwhich had evidently disturbed him. \"Well, what business is it of\nmine what goes on there--whether Arakcheev is bad, and all that?\nWhat business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt\nthat I was threatened with prison, and had a mother who could not\nsee or understand it? And then there are you and the children and\nour affairs. Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the\noffice from morning to night? No, but I know I must work to comfort my\nmother, to repay you, and not to leave the children such beggars as\nI was.\"\n\nCountess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread\nalone and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But\nshe knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do\nso. She only took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of\napproval and a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few\nminutes\' reflection continued to think aloud.\n\n\"You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofanych\" (this was his overseer)\n\"came back from the Tambov estate and told me they are already\noffering eighty thousand rubles for the forest.\"\n\nAnd with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of\nrepurchasing Otradnoe before long, and added: \"Another ten years of\nlife and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.\"\n\nCountess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he\ntold her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would\nsometimes ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he\nnoticed that she had been thinking about something else. But she had\nto force herself to attend, for what he was saying did not interest\nher at all. She looked at him and did not think, but felt, about\nsomething different. She felt a submissive tender love for this man\nwho would never understand all that she understood, and this seemed to\nmake her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate\ntenderness. Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and\nhindered her from following the details of her husband\'s plans,\nthoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted\nthrough her mind. She thought of her nephew. Her husband\'s account\nof the boy\'s agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her\nforcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive character\nrecurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she thought\nalso of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but\ncompared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt\nwith regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for\nyoung Nicholas.\n\nSometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the\ndifference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and\npromised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the\nimpossible--in this life to love her husband, her children, little\nNicholas, and all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess\nMary\'s soul always strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the\nabsolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of\nthe lofty, secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on\nher face. Nicholas gazed at her. \"O God! What will become of us if she\ndies, as I always fear when her face is like that?\" thought he, and\nplacing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers.');

Natasha was so used to this kind of talk with\nher husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being\nwrong between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning.\nWhen he began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly\nand she, led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that\nthey were on the verge of a quarrel.\n\nFrom the moment they were alone and Natasha came up to him with\nwide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her\nbosom, saying: \"Now you are all mine, mine! You won\'t escape!\"--from\nthat moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic\nand contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked\nabout at one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many\ntopics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was\nthe surest sign that they fully understood one another.\n\nJust as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and\ncontradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this\nintercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves\nwere not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted\nthem.\n\nNatasha spoke to Pierre about her brother\'s life and doings, of\nhow she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of\nhow she was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way\nbetter than herself. In saying this Natasha was sincere in\nacknowledging Mary\'s superiority, but at the same time by saying it\nshe made a demand on Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her\nto Mary and to all other women, and that now, especially after\nhaving seen many women in Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.\n\nPierre, answering Natasha\'s words, told her how intolerable it had\nbeen for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.\n\n\"I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,\" he said. \"It was\nsimply dull. Besides, I was very busy.\"\n\nNatasha looked intently at him and went on:\n\n\"Mary is so splendid,\" she said. \"How she understands children! It\nis as if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance,\nMitya was naughty...\"\n\n\"How like his father he is,\" Pierre interjected.\n\nNatasha knew why he mentioned Mitya\'s likeness to Nicholas: the\nrecollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and\nhe wanted to know what Natasha thought of it.\n\n\"Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not\ngenerally accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a\nfresh line,\" said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.\n\n\"No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are\nan amusement--almost a pastime,\" said Pierre. \"For instance, he is\ncollecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till\nhe has read what he had already bought--Sismondi and Rousseau and\nMontesquieu,\" he added with a smile. \"You know how much I...\" he began\nto soften down what he had said; but Natasha interrupted him to show\nthat this was unnecessary.\n\n\"So you say ideas are an amusement to him....\"\n\n\"Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg\nI saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all\nelse is mere amusement.\"\n\n\"Ah, I\'m so sorry I wasn\'t there when you met the children,\" said\nNatasha. \"Which was most delighted? Lisa, I\'m sure.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind.\n\"Nicholas says we ought not to think. But I can\'t help it. Besides,\nwhen I was in Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole\naffair would go to pieces without me--everyone was pulling his own\nway. But I succeeded in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear\nand simple. You see, I don\'t say that we ought to oppose this and\nthat. We may be mistaken. What I say is: \'Join hands, you who love the\nright, and let there be but one banner--that of active virtue.\' Prince\nSergey is a fine fellow and clever.\"\n\nNatasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre\'s\nidea, but one thing disconcerted her. \"Can a man so important and\nnecessary to society be also my husband? How did this happen?\" She\nwished to express this doubt to him. \"Now who could decide whether\nhe is really cleverer than all the others?\" she asked herself, and\npassed in review all those whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what\nhe had said there was no one he had respected so highly as Platon\nKarataev.\n\n\"Do you know what I am thinking about?\" she asked. \"About Platon\nKarataev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?\"\n\nPierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood\nhis wife\'s line of thought.\n\n\"Platon Karataev?\" he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely\ntrying to imagine Karataev\'s opinion on the subject. \"He would not\nhave understood... yet perhaps he would.\"\n\n\"I love you awfully!\" Natasha suddenly said. \"Awfully, awfully!\"\n\n\"No, he would not have approved,\" said Pierre, after reflection.\n\"What he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so\nanxious to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and\nI should have been proud to let him see us. There now--you talk of\nmy absence, but you wouldn\'t believe what a special feeling I have for\nyou after a separation....\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think...\" Natasha began.\n\n\"No, it\'s not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldn\'t\nlove more, but this is something special.... Yes, of course-\" he did\nnot finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.\n\n\"What nonsense it is,\" Natasha suddenly exclaimed, \"about\nhoneymoons, and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the\ncontrary, now is the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do\nyou remember how we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always\nmine. And what we quarreled about--I don\'t even remember!\"\n\n\"Always about the same thing,\" said Pierre with a smile. \"Jealo...\"\n\n\"Don\'t say it! I can\'t bear it!\" Natasha cried, and her eyes\nglittered coldly and vindictively. \"Did you see her?\" she added, after\na pause.\n\n\"No, and if I had I shouldn\'t have recognized her.\"\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\"Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at\nyou,\" Natasha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had\ncome over them. \"You are as like him as two peas--like the boy.\" (She\nmeant her little son.) \"Oh, it\'s time to go to him.... The milk\'s\ncome.... But I\'m sorry to leave you.\"\n\nThey were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one\nanother at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with\nself-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha with a quiet, happy smile.\nHaving interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other\ncontinue.\n\n\"No. What did you say? Go on, go on.\"\n\n\"No, you go on, I was talking nonsense,\" said Natasha.\n\nPierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his\ncomplacent reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it\nseemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the\nwhole of Russian society and to the whole world.\n\n\"I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are\nalways simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united\nand constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now\nthat\'s simple enough.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what were you going to say?\"\n\n\"I? Only nonsense.\"\n\n\"But all the same?\"\n\n\"Oh nothing, only a trifle,\" said Natasha, smilingly still more\nbrightly. \"I only wanted to tell you about Petya: today nurse was\ncoming to take him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung\nto me. I\'m sure he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now\nhe\'s crying. Well, good-by!\" and she left the room.\n\n\nMeanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski\'s bedroom a\nlittle lamp was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark\nand they could not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four\npillows and his Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring.\nLittle Nicholas, who had just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat\nup in bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from\na terrible dream. He had dreamed that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing\nhelmets such as were depicted in his Plutarch, were leading a huge\narmy. The army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air\nlike the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which Dessalles called\nles fils de la Vierge. In front was Glory, which was similar to\nthose threads but rather thicker. He and Pierre were borne along\nlightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their goal. Suddenly the\nthreads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it\ngrew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before them in a\nstern and threatening attitude.\n\n\"Have you done this?\" he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and\npens. \"I loved you, but I have orders from Arakcheev and will kill the\nfirst of you who moves forward.\" Little Nicholas turned to look at\nPierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his\nfather--Prince Andrew--and his father had neither shape nor form, but\nhe existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with\nlove: he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father\ncaressed and pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to\nthem. Terror seized young Nicholas and he awoke.\n\n\"My father!\" he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of\nPrince Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human\nform.) \"My father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of\nme and of Uncle Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it.\nMucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing\nhappen to me? I know they want me to learn. And I will learn. But\nsomeday I shall have finished learning, and then I will do\nsomething. I only pray God that something may happen to me such as\nhappened to Plutarch\'s men, and I will act as they did. I will do\nbetter. Everyone shall know me, love me, and be delighted with me!\"\nAnd suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry.\n\n\"Are you ill?\" he heard Dessalles\' voice asking.\n\n\"No,\" answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.\n\n\"He is good and kind and I am fond of him!\" he thought of Dessalles.\n\"But Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father?\nOh, Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he\nwould be satisfied....\"');

To seize and put\ninto words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a\nsingle nation, appears impossible.\n\nThe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to\ndescribe and seize the apparently elusive--the life of a people.\nThey described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and\nregarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the\nwhole nation.\n\nThe question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished\nand by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the\nancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations\nto the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so\nas to accomplish ends that were predestined.\n\nFor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the\ndirect participation of the Deity in human affairs.\n\nModern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.\n\nIt would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in\nman\'s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward\nwhich nations are led, modern history should study not the\nmanifestations of power but the causes that produce it. But modern\nhistory has not done this. Having in theory rejected the view held\nby the ancients, it still follows them in practice.\n\nInstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by\nthe will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed\nwith extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very\nvarious kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses.\nInstead of the former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or\nRoman nations, which ancient historians regarded as representing the\nprogress of humanity, modern history has postulated its own aims--the\nwelfare of the French, German, or English people, or, in its highest\nabstraction, the welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by\nwhich is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small\nnorthwesterly portion of a large continent.\n\nModern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without\nreplacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has\nobliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the\ndivine authority of the kings and the \"fate\" of the ancients, to reach\nthe same conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations\nguided by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to\nwhich these nations and humanity at large are tending.\n\nAt the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon\nto Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent\nnovelty of their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.\n\nIn the first place the historian describes the activity of\nindividuals who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian\nconsiders only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men,\nwhile another includes also orators, learned men, reformers,\nphilosophers, and poets). Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward\nwhich humanity is being led is known to the historians: to one of them\nthis goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, or French realm;\nto another it is liberty, equality, and a certain kind of civilization\nof a small corner of the world called Europe.\n\nIn 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is\nexpressed by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it\nmoves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east\nwestward. In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with\nremarkable symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west,\nattracting to it, as the first movement had done, the nations of\nmiddle Europe. The counter movement reaches the starting point of\nthe first movement in the west--Paris--and subsides.\n\nDuring that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left\nuntilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions of\nmen migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions of\nChristian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one\nanother.\n\nWhat does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people\nburn houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these\nevents? What force made men act so? These are the instinctive,\nplain, and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it\nencounters the monuments and tradition of that period.\n\nFor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns\nto the science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity\nto know themselves.\n\nIf history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have\nsaid that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and\ndirected his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that\nreply, would have been clear and complete. One might believe or\ndisbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone\nbelieving in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the\nhistory of that period, nor would there have been any contradictions.\n\nBut modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit\nthe conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the\nDeity in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other\nanswers.\n\nModern history replying to these questions says: you want to know\nwhat this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced\nthese events? Then listen:\n\n\"Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such\nand such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France\nbadly. His descendants were weak men and they too ruled France\nbadly. And they had such and such favorites and such and such\nmistresses. Moreover, certain men wrote some books at that time. At\nthe end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men\nin Paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal. This\ncaused people all over France to begin to slash at and drown one\nanother. They killed the king and many other people. At that time\nthere was in France a man of genius--Napoleon. He conquered\neverybody everywhere--that is, he killed many people because he was\na great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and\nkilled them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he\nreturned to France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all\nobeyed him. Having become an Emperor he again went out to kill\npeople in Italy, Austria, and Prussia. And there too he killed a great\nmany. In Russia there was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to\nrestore order in Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807\nhe suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled\nand again began killing many people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand\nmen into Russia and captured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from\nMoscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and\nothers, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace. All\nNapoleon\'s allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces\nadvanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated\nNapoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him\nto the island of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and\nshowing him every respect, though five years before and one year later\nthey all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII,\nwho till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the\nAllies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears before his Old\nGuards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then the skillful\nstatesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who managed to\nsit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended\nthe frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by these conversations\nmade the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the diplomatists and\nmonarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering\ntheir armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon arrived in\nFrance with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating him,\nimmediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were angry\nat this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated\nthe genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent\nhim to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the\nbeloved France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that\nrock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a\nreaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress\ntheir subjects.\"\n\nIt would be a mistake to think that this is ironic--a caricature\nof the historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild\nexpression of the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions,\nwhich all the historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the\nhistories of separate states to the writers of general histories and\nthe new histories of the culture of that period.\n\nThe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact\nthat modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has\nasked.\n\nIf the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement\nof humanity and of the peoples, the first question--in the absence\nof a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible--is: what is\nthe power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously\nreplies either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was\nvery proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.\n\nAll that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it\nis not what was asked. All that would be interesting if we\nrecognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently\ndirecting its nations through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we\ndo not acknowledge such a power, and therefore before speaking about\nNapoleons, Louis-es, and authors, we ought to be shown the\nconnection existing between these men and the movement of the nations.\n\nIf instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it\nshould be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole\ninterest of history lies precisely in that force.\n\nHistory seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to\neveryone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone\nreading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new\nforce, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really\nquite well known to everybody.');

In\ntheir narration events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and\nAlexander, or in general of the persons they describe. The answers\ngiven by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes\nevents to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one\nhistorian to each event. As soon as historians of different\nnationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event, the\nreplies they give immediately lose all meaning, for this force is\nunderstood by them all not only differently but often in quite\ncontradictory ways. One historian says that an event was produced by\nNapoleon\'s power, another that it was produced by Alexander\'s, a third\nthat it was due to the power of some other person. Besides this,\nhistorians of that kind contradict each other even in their\nstatement as to the force on which the authority of some particular\nperson was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon\'s power\nwas based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was\nbased on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians\nof this class, by mutually destroying one another\'s positions, destroy\nthe understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no\nreply to history\'s essential question.\n\nWriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to\nrecognize how erroneous is the specialist historians\' view of the\nforce which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power\ninherent in heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a\nmultiplicity of variously directed forces. In describing a war or\nthe subjugation of a people, a general historian looks for the cause\nof the event not in the power of one man, but in the interaction of\nmany persons connected with the event.\n\nAccording to this view the power of historical personages,\nrepresented as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would\nseem, be regarded as a force that itself produces events. Yet in\nmost cases universal historians still employ the conception of power\nas a force that itself produces events, and treat it as their cause.\nIn their exposition, an historic character is first the product of his\ntime, and his power only the resultant of various forces, and then his\npower is itself a force producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and\nothers, for instance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a product of\nthe Revolution, of the ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at another\nplainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not\nlike were simply the product of Napoleon\'s misdirected will, and\nthat the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by\nNapoleon\'s caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper\nof the age produced Napoleon\'s power. But Napoleon\'s power\nsuppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the\nage.\n\nThis curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur\nat every step, but the universal historians\' accounts are all made\nup of a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs\nbecause after entering the field of analysis the universal\nhistorians stop halfway.\n\nTo find component forces equal to the composite or resultant\nforce, the sum of the components must equal the resultant. This\ncondition is never observed by the universal historians, and so to\nexplain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to\nthe insufficient components, another unexplained force affecting the\nresultant action.\n\nSpecialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the\nrestoration of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were\nproduced by the will of Alexander. But the universal historian\nGervinus, refuting this opinion of the specialist historian, tries to\nprove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons\nwere due to other things beside Alexander\'s will--such as the activity\nof Stein, Metternich, Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, Fichte\nChateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently decomposes\nAlexander\'s power into the components: Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, and\nthe rest--but the sum of the components, that is, the interactions of\nChateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and the others, evidently\ndoes not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of millions of\nFrenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, Madame de\nStael, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected\ntheir mutual relations but does not account for the submission of\nmillions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs\nthe submission of millions of people resulted--that is, how component\nforces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times\nA--the historian is again obliged to fall back on power--the force he\nhad denied--and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that\nis, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And\nthat is just what the universal historians do, and consequently they\nnot only contradict the specialist historians but contradict\nthemselves.\n\nPeasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to\nwhether they want rain or fine weather: \"The wind has blown the clouds\naway,\" or, \"The wind has brought up the clouds.\" And in the same way\nthe universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in\nwith their theory, say that power is the result of events, and\nsometimes, when they want to prove something else, say that power\nproduces events.\n\nA third class of historians--the so-called historians of\nculture--following the path laid down by the universal historians who\nsometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events--again\ntake that force to be something quite different. They see it in what\nis called culture--in mental activity.\n\nThe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their\nprogenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical\nevents may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one\nanother in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that\nsuch and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense\nnumber of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these\nhistorians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that\nthis indication is the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove\nthat the cause of events lies in intellectual activity, only by a\ngreat stretch can one admit that there is any connection between\nintellectual activity and the movement of peoples, and in no case\ncan one admit that intellectual activity controls people\'s actions,\nfor that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders\nof the French Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality\nof man, or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the\npreaching of love.\n\nBut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments\nwith which these histories are filled--admitting that nations are\ngoverned by some undefined force called an idea--history\'s essential\nquestion still remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs\nand to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the\nuniversal historians, another, newer force--the idea--is added, the\nconnection of which with the masses needs explanation. It is\npossible to understand that Napoleon had power and so events occurred;\nwith some effort one may even conceive that Napoleon together with\nother influences was the cause of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat\nsocial, had the effect of making Frenchmen begin to drown one\nanother cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal\nnexus of this new force with the event.\n\nUndoubtedly some relation exists between all who live\ncontemporaneously, and so it is possible to find some connection\nbetween the intellectual activity of men and their historical\nmovements, just as such a connection may be found between the\nmovements of humanity and commerce, handicraft, gardening, or anything\nelse you please. But why intellectual activity is considered by the\nhistorians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole\nhistorical movement is hard to understand. Only the following\nconsiderations can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1)\nthat history is written by learned men, and so it is natural and\nagreeable for them to think that the activity of their class\nsupplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a\nsimilar belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists,\nand soldiers (if they do not express it, that is merely because\ntraders and soldiers do not write history), and (2) that spiritual\nactivity, enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas, are all\nindistinct, indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very\neasy to use words having a still less definite meaning, and which\ncan therefore be readily introduced into any theory.\n\nBut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this\nkind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something)\nthe histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and\nmore to approximate, are significant from the fact that after\nseriously and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and\npolitical doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to\ndescribe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for\ninstance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise\nof power--and say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon\'s will.\nSpeaking so, the historians of culture involuntarily contradict\nthemselves, and show that the new force they have devised does not\naccount for what happens in history, and that history can only be\nexplained by introducing a power which they apparently do not\nrecognize.');

A third asserts that the cause of its movement\nlies in the smoke which the wind carries away.\n\nThe peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation.\nTo refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no\ndevil, or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is\nnot the devil but a German, who moves the locomotive.

The man who explains the movement of the locomotive by\nthe smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not\nsupply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to\nhim and in his turn has offered that as an explanation.\n\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the\nlocomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.\n\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples\nis that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the\npeoples.\n\nYet to supply this conception various historians take forces of\ndifferent kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement\nobserved. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the\npeasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force\nresulting from several other forces, like the movement of the\nwheels; others again as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that\nis blown away.\n\nSo long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether\nCaesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories of\nall, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite\nimpossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception\nof a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain\nend. And the only such conception known to historians is that of\npower.\n\nThis conception is the one handle by means of which the material\nof history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who\nbreaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other\nmethod of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the\none possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception\nof power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated\nby the universal historians and historians of culture themselves,\nfor they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have\nrecourse to it at every step.\n\nIn dealing with humanity\'s inquiry, the science of history up to now\nis like money in circulation--paper money and coin. The biographies\nand special national histories are like paper money. They can be\nused and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to\nanyone and even advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the\nsecurity behind them. You need only forget to ask how the will of\nheroes produces events, and such histories as Thiers\' will be\ninteresting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of\npoetry. But just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise\neither because, being easy to make, too much of it gets made or\nbecause people try to exchange it for gold, so also doubts\nconcerning the real value of such histories arise either because too\nmany of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone\ninquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?--that is, wants to\nexchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual\ncomprehension.\n\nThe writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are\nlike people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to\nsubstitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific\ngravity of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more\nthan that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is\ndeceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle.\nAs gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange\nbut also for use, so universal historians will be valuable only when\nthey can reply to history\'s essential question: what is power? The\nuniversal historians give contradictory replies to that question,\nwhile the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite\ndifferent. And as counters of imitation gold can be used only among\na group of people who agree to accept them as gold, or among those who\ndo not know the nature of gold, so universal historians and historians\nof culture, not answering humanity\'s essential question, serve as\ncurrency for some purposes of their own, only in universities and\namong the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call \"serious\nreading.\"');

We are so\naccustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the\nquestion: why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon\nuttered certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and\nso what he ordered was done.\n\nThis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was\ngiven him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes\nessential to determine what is this power of one man over others.\n\nIt cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak\none--a domination based on the application or threat of physical\nforce, like the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect\nof moral force, as in their simplicity some historians think who say\nthat the leading figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted\nwith a special strength of soul and mind called genius. This power\ncannot be based on the predominance of moral strength, for, not to\nmention heroes such as Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions\ndiffer widely, history shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a\nMetternich, who ruled over millions of people, had any particular\nmoral qualities, but on the contrary were generally morally weaker\nthan any of the millions they ruled over.\n\nIf the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral\nqualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for\nelsewhere--in the relation to the people of the man who wields the\npower.\n\nAnd that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,\nthat exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history\'s\nunderstanding of power for true gold.\n\nPower is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed\nor tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.\n\nIn the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how\na state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to\nbe arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that\ndefinition of power needs explanation.\n\nThe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the\nancients regarded fire--namely, as something existing absolutely.\nBut for history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for\nmodern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.\n\nFrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history\nand that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell\nminutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what\npower--existing immutably outside time--is, but to history\'s questions\nabout the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer\nnothing.\n\nIf power be the collective will of the people transferred to their\nruler, was Pugachev a representative of the will of the people? If\nnot, then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when\nhe was taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those\ncriminals whom he arrested?\n\nDo palace revolutions--in which sometimes only two or three people\ntake part--transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In\ninternational relations, is the will of the people also transferred to\ntheir conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine\ntransferred to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people\ntransferred to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the\nFrench went to fight the Austrians?\n\nTo these questions three answers are possible:\n\nEither to assume (1) that the will of the people is always\nunconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen,\nand that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle\nagainst the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as\nan infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the\npeople is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite\nand known conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and\neven destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers\nof the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or\n(3) that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers\nconditionally, but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and\nthat the appearance of several authorities, their struggles and\ntheir falls, result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by\nthe rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people\nis transferred from some people to others.\n\nAnd these are the three ways in which the historians do explain\nthe relation of the people to their rulers.\n\nSome historians--those biographical and specialist historians\nalready referred to--in their simplicity failing to understand the\nquestion of the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective\nwill of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical\npersons, and therefore when describing some single state they assume\nthat particular power to be the one absolute and real power, and\nthat any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of\npower--mere violence.\n\nTheir theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of\nhistory, has the inconvenience--in application to complex and stormy\nperiods in the life of nations during which various powers arise\nsimultaneously and struggle with one another--that a Legitimist\nhistorian will prove that the National Convention, the Directory,\nand Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power, while a\nRepublican and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that the Convention\nand the other that the Empire was the real power, and that all the\nothers were violations of power. Evidently the explanations\nfurnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only\nsatisfy young children.\n\nRecognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of\nhistorians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the\nwill of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have\npower only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will\nof the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this\nprogram consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they\ncontinually contradict one another.\n\nEach historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation\'s\nprogress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth,\nfreedom, or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country.\nBut not to mention the historians\' contradictions as to the nature\nof this program--or even admitting that some one general program of\nthese conditions exists--the facts of history almost always contradict\nthat theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted\nconsist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how\nis it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible end their reigns\ntranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their\npeople? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV\'s activity,\ncontrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did it not\nreact on Louis XIV or on Louis XV--why should it react just on Louis\nXVI? And what is the time limit for such reactions? To these questions\nthere are and can be no answers. Equally little does this view explain\nwhy for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from\ncertain rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of\nfifty years is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to\nNapoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to\nCharles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to\nNapoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers of the people\'s\nwill from one individual to another, especially in view of\ninternational relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians\nare obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal\ndelegations of the people\'s will but are accidents dependent on\ncunning, on mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a\nruler, or a party leader. So that the greater part of the events of\nhistory--civil wars, revolutions, and conquests--are presented by\nthese historians not as the results of free transferences of the\npeople\'s will, but as results of the ill-directed will of one or\nmore individuals, that is, once again, as usurpations of power. And so\nthese historians also see and admit historical events which are\nexceptions to the theory.\n\nThese historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some\nplants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that\nall that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the\npalm, the mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth\nand no longer resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.\n\nHistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people\nis transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the\nconditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have\npower only because they fulfill the will of the people which has\nbeen delegated to them.\n\nBut in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the\nhistoric leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have\nthose leaders?\n\nThe leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the\npeople: the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the\npeople.\n\nBut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the\nleaders serves as an expression of the people\'s will or only some part\nof it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression\nof the people\'s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details\nof the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or\na Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is\nevident nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the\nactivity of an historical leader which serves to express the\npeople\'s life, as other so-called \"philosophical\" historians\nbelieve, then to determine which side of the activity of a leader\nexpresses the nation\'s life, we have first of all to know in what\nthe nation\'s life consists.\n\nMet by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most\nobscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all\nconceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of\nhumanity\'s movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by\nalmost all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment,\nprogress, civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization\nas the goal of the movement of humanity, the historians study the\nmen of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained: kings,\nministers, generals, authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to\nthe extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or\nhindered that abstraction. But as it is in no way proved that the\naim of humanity does consist in freedom, equality, enlightenment, or\ncivilization, and as the connection of the people with the rulers\nand enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption\nthat the collective will of the people is always transferred to the\nmen whom we have noticed, it happens that the activity of the millions\nwho migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, and destroy one another\nnever is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people\nwho did not burn houses, practice agriculture, or slay their fellow\ncreatures.\n\nHistory proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples\nof the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive\neastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their\nmistresses and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau,\nDiderot, Beaumarchais, and others?\n\nIs the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazan and\nSiberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Ivan the\nTerrible and by his correspondence with Kurbski?\n\nIs the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained\nby the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their\nladies? For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without\nleaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit,\nremains incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the\ncessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the\nCrusade--the deliverance of Jerusalem--had been clearly defined by\nhistoric leaders. Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples to\nfree the Holy Land; but the people did not go, for the unknown cause\nwhich had previously impelled them to go no longer existed. The\nhistory of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover\nthe life of the peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and the\nMinnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers,\nbut the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has\nremained unknown.\n\nStill less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us\nthe life of the peoples.\n\nThe history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of\nlife and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had a\nhot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was\nsuspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why\nafter the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why\nduring the French Revolution they guillotined one another.\n\nIf we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest\nhistorians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not\nthe history of the life of the peoples.');

(With\nthis method of observation it often happens that the observer,\ninfluenced by the direction he himself prefers, regards those as\nleaders who, owing to the people\'s change of direction, are no\nlonger in front, but on one side, or even in the rear.)\n\n\"If the animals in front are continually changing and the\ndirection of the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because\nin order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will\nto the animals that have attracted our attention, and to study the\nmovements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent\nanimals moving on all sides of the herd.\" So say the third class of\nhistorians who regard all historical persons, from monarchs to\njournalists, as the expression of their age.\n\nThe theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic\npersons is merely a paraphrase--a restatement of the question in other\nwords.\n\nWhat causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the\ncollective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what\ncondition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On\ncondition that that person expresses the will of the whole people.\nThat is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning\nof which we do not understand.\n\n\nIf the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,\nthen having subjected to criticism the explanation of \"power\" that\njuridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is\nmerely a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena\nman has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies\nhis reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a\nword but an actually existing phenomenon.\n\nNot to speak of the fact that no description of the collective\nactivity of men can do without the conception of power, the\nexistence of power is proved both by history and by observing\ncontemporary events.\n\nWhenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose\nwill the event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree\nand the French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue\ndecrees and an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and\nan army enters Russia. Alexander I gives a command and the French\nsubmit to the Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs\nit is always related to the will of one or of several men who have\ndecreed it.\n\nThe historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine\nintervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in\nthe expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that\nsupposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.\n\nOn the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man\'s\nwill--his words--are only part of the general activity expressed in an\nevent, as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without\nassuming an incomprehensible, supernatural force--a miracle--one\ncannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of\nmillions of men. On the other hand, even if we admitted that words\ncould be the cause of events, history shows that the expression of the\nwill of historical personages does not in most cases produce any\neffect, that is to say, their commands are often not executed, and\nsometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs.\n\nWithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity\nwe cannot regard \"power\" as the cause of events.\n\nPower, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation\nthat exists between the expression of someone\'s will and the execution\nof that will by others.\n\nTo explain the conditions of that relationship we must first\nestablish a conception of the expression of will, referring it to\nman and not to the Deity.\n\nIf the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient\nhistory tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time\nand is not caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by\nan event. But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will\nof men acting in time and in relation to one another, to explain the\nconnection of commands with events we must restore: (1) the\ncondition of all that takes place: the continuity of movement in\ntime both of the events and of the person who commands, and (2) the\ninevitability of the connection between the person commanding and\nthose who execute his command.');

Napoleon could not have\ncommanded an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered\nsuch and such papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to\nPetersburg; tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the\nfleet, the commissariat, and so on and so on--millions of commands,\nwhich formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events\nwhich brought the French armies into Russia.\n\nIf throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an\ninvasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so much\ntime and effort, and yet during his whole reign never once attempted\nto execute that design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with\nwhich country he considered it desirable to be in alliance (a\nconviction he repeatedly expressed)--this came about because his\ncommands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case,\nbut did so correspond in the latter.\n\nFor an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man\nshould order what can be executed. But to know what can and what\ncannot be executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon\'s\ninvasion of Russia in which millions participated, but even in the\nsimplest event, for in either case millions of obstacles may arise\nto prevent its execution. Every order executed is always one of an\nimmense number unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with\nthe course of events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get\nlinked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a\nseries of events, and are executed.\n\nOur false conception that an event is caused by a command which\nprecedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and\nout of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent\nwith that event have been executed, we forget about the others that\nwere not executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the\nchief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in\nthe historical accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and\npetty events, such for instance as all those which led the French\narmies to Russia, is generalized into one event in accord with the\nresult produced by that series of events, and corresponding with\nthis generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized\ninto a single expression of will.\n\nWe say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In\nreality in all Napoleon\'s activity we never find anything resembling\nan expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or\nexpressions of his will, very variously and indefinitely directed.\nAmid a long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon\'s one series,\nfor the campaign of 1812, was carried out--not because those orders\ndiffered in any way from the other, unexecuted orders but because they\ncoincided with the course of events that led the French army into\nRussia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not\nbecause the color was laid on from this side or in that way, but\nbecause it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the\nstencil.\n\nSo that examining the relation in time of the commands to the\nevents, we find that a command can never be the cause of the event,\nbut that a certain definite dependence exists between the two.\n\nTo understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to\nreinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not\nfrom the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the\ncommand himself takes part in the event.\n\nThis relation of the commander to those he commands is just what\nis called power. This relation consists in the following:\n\nFor common action people always unite in certain combinations, in\nwhich regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common\naction, the relation between those taking part in it is always the\nsame.\n\nMen uniting in these combinations always assume such relations\ntoward one another that the larger number take a more direct share,\nand the smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action\nfor which they have combined.\n\nOf all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one\nof the most striking and definite examples is an army.\n\nEvery army is composed of lower grades of the service--the rank\nand file--of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next\nhigher military rank--corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom\nthere are fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are\nstill fewer, and so on to the highest military command which is\nconcentrated in one person.\n\nA military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone,\nof which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and\nfile; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of\nthe next higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point\nof which will represent the commander in chief.\n\nThe soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section\nof the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing,\nhacking, burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for\nthese actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The\nnoncommissioned officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the\naction itself less frequently than the soldiers, but they already give\ncommands. An officer still less often acts directly himself, but\ncommands still more frequently. A general does nothing but command the\ntroops, indicates the objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon\nhimself. The commander in chief never takes direct part in the\naction itself, but only gives general orders concerning the movement\nof the mass of the troops. A similar relation of people to one another\nis seen in every combination of men for common activity--in\nagriculture, trade, and every administration.\n\nAnd so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of\na cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in\nany administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to\nthe highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action,\ncombine in such relations that the more directly they participate in\nperforming the action the less they can command and the more\nnumerous they are, while the less their direct participation in the\naction itself, the more they command and the fewer of them there\nare; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top,\nwho takes the least direct share in the action and directs his\nactivity chiefly to commanding.\n\nThis relation of the men who command to those they command is what\nconstitutes the essence of the conception called power.\n\nHaving restored the condition of time under which all events\noccur, we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a\ncorresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of\nrelation between those who command and those who execute, we find that\nby the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest\npart in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively\ndirected to commanding.');

When one of the opinions\nexpressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event\nas a command preceding it.\n\nMen are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to\nhow and where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens\nthat this is done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have\ncommand and power in their primary form. The man who worked most\nwith his hands could not think so much about what he was doing, or\nreflect on or command what would result from the common activity;\nwhile the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his\nhands on account of his greater verbal activity.\n\nWhen some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common\naim there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their\nactivity is given to directing and commanding, take less part in the\ndirect work.\n\nWhen a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections\nwhich as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his\npresent activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just\nthe same is done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not\ntake a direct part in the activity to devise considerations,\njustifications, and surmises concerning their collective activity.\n\nFor reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and\nkill one another. And corresponding to the event its justification\nappears in people\'s belief that this was necessary for the welfare\nof France, for liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one\nanother, and this event was accompanied by its justification in the\nnecessity for a centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and\nso on. Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men,\nand the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France,\nthe baseness of England, and so on. History shows us that these\njustifications of the events have no common sense and are all\ncontradictory, as in the case of killing a man as the result of\nrecognizing his rights, and the killing of millions in Russia for\nthe humiliation of England. But these justifications have a very\nnecessary significance in their own day.\n\nThese justifications release those who produce the events from moral\nresponsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front\nof a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they\nclear men\'s moral responsibilities from their path.\n\nWithout such justification there would be no reply to the simplest\nquestion that presents itself when examining each historical event.\nHow is it that millions of men commit collective crimes--make war,\ncommit murder, and so on?\n\nWith the present complex forms of political and social life in\nEurope can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by\nmonarchs, ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is\nthere any collective action which cannot find its justification in\npolitical unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in\ncivilization? So that every event that occurs inevitably coincides\nwith some expressed wish and, receiving a justification, presents\nitself as the result of the will of one man or of several men.\n\nIn whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts\nwill always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship\nthe movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.\n\nOnly by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that\nflow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince\nourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement\nof the ship, and that we were led into error by the fact that we\nourselves were imperceptibly moving.\n\nWe see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of\nhistorical characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable\ncondition of all that occurs--the continuity of movement in time)\nand do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical\npersons with the masses.\n\nWhen the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same\nwave ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also\nturns frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the\nwave anticipating its movement.\n\nWhatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen\nand decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither\ndirects nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a\ndistance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the\nship\'s movement also.\n\n\nExamining only those expressions of the will of historical persons\nwhich, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed\nthat the events depended on those commands. But examining the events\nthemselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to\nthe people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on\nevents. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however\nmany commands were issued, the event does not take place unless\nthere are other causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs--be it\nwhat it may--then out of all the continually expressed wishes of\ndifferent people some will always be found which by their meaning\nand their time of utterance are related as commands to the events.\n\nArriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively\nto these two essential questions of history:\n\n(1) What is power?\n\n(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?\n\n(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, in\nwhich the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and\njustifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is\nhis participation in that action.\n\n(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by\nintellectual activity, nor even by a combination of the two as\nhistorians have supposed, but by the activity of all the people who\nparticipate in the events, and who always combine in such a way that\nthose taking the largest direct share in the event take on\nthemselves the least responsibility and vice versa.\n\nMorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event;\nphysically it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral\nactivity is inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event\nis neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.\n\nOr in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to\nthe phenomena we are examining.\n\nIn the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity--that final\nlimit to which in every domain of thought man\'s reason arrives if it\nis not playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat\nproduces electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one\nanother.\n\nSpeaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we\ncannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is\ninconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law.\nThe same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we\ndo not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,\npeople combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and\nwe say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in\nother words that it is a law.');

But the law of history relates to man. A\nparticle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of\nattraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is\nthe subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not\nsubject to the law.\n\nThe presence of the problem of man\'s free will, though\nunexpressed, is felt at every step of history.\n\nAll seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered\nthis question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and\nthe false path historical science has followed are due solely to the\nlack of a solution of that question.\n\nIf the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act\nas he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected\nincidents.\n\nIf in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely,\nthat is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that\nman\'s in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy\nthe possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of\nhumanity.\n\nIf there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will\ncannot exist, for then man\'s will is subject to that law.\n\nIn this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most\nancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most\nancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.\n\nThe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from\nwhatever point of view--theological, historical, ethical, or\nphilosophic--we find a general law of necessity to which he (like\nall that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves\nas what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.\n\nThis consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from\nand independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself,\nbut only through consciousness does he know himself.\n\nApart from consciousness of self no observation or application of\nreason is conceivable.\n\nTo understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of\nall be conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of\nhimself as a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is\nconscious of his volition. But his will--which forms the essence of\nhis life--man recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.\n\nIf, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed\nby one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking\nfood, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this\nnever-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation\nof it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man\'s will seems to\nhim to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as\nfree.\n\nYou say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.\nEveryone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable\ndemonstration of freedom.\n\nThat reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not\nsubject to reason.\n\nIf the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and\nindependent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to\nreasoning and to experience, but in fact such subjection does not\nexist and is inconceivable.\n\nA series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he,\nas an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man\nsubmits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or\nimpermeability once he has become acquainted with them. But the same\nseries of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete\nfreedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible, and that\nhis every action depends on his organization, his character, and the\nmotives acting upon him; yet man never submits to the deductions of\nthese experiments and arguments. Having learned from experiment and\nargument that a stone falls downwards, a man indubitably believes this\nand always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled.\n\nBut learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws,\nhe does not and cannot believe this.\n\nHowever often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the\nsame conditions and with the same character he will do the same\nthing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the\nsame character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that\nalways ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before\nthe experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or\nsage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him\nthat it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in\nprecisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational\nconception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot\nimagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so,\nfor without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable\nto understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single\nmoment.\n\nHe could not live, because all man\'s efforts, all his impulses to\nlife, are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame\nand obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness,\nhealth and disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion\nand hunger, virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of\nfreedom.\n\nA man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of\nlife.\n\nIf the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless\ncontradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one\nand the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that\nonly proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.\n\nThis unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom,\nuncontrolled by experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and\nfelt by everyone without exception, this consciousness without which\nno conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the\nquestion.\n\nMan is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing\nGod. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the\nconsciousness of man\'s freedom? That is a question for theology.\n\nThe actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed\nin statistics. What is man\'s responsibility to society, the conception\nof which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question\nfor jurisprudence.\n\nMan\'s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives\nacting upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and\nwrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom?\nThat is a question for ethics.\n\nMan in connection with the general life of humanity appears\nsubject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from\nthat connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations\nand of humanity be regarded--as the result of the free, or as the\nresult of the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for\nhistory.\n\nOnly in our self-confident day of the popularization of\nknowledge--thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the\ndiffusion of printed matter--has the question of the freedom of will\nbeen put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist. In our\ntime the majority of so-called advanced people--that is, the crowd of\nignoramuses--have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one\nside of the question for a solution of the whole problem.\n\nThey say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,\nfor the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular\nmovements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul\nand free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we\nsprang from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that\nthousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such\nardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative\nzoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the\nthinkers, but has never been denied. They do not see that the role\nof the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an\ninstrument for the illumination of one side of it. For the fact\nthat, from the point of view of observation, reason and the will are\nmerely secretions of the brain, and that man following the general law\nmay have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of\ntime, only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands\nof years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories--that\nfrom the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of\nnecessity; but it does not advance by a hair\'s breadth the solution of\nthe question, which has another, opposite, side, based on the\nconsciousness of freedom.\n\nIf men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is\nas comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at\na certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is\nthe time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of\nhow man\'s consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of\nnecessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative\nphysiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can\nobserve only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe\nconsciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.\n\nThe naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this\nquestion, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls\nof a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief\nsuperintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over\nthe windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should\nbe delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything\nis now so smooth and regular.');

History surveys a\npresentation of man\'s life in which the union of these two\ncontradictions has already taken place.\n\nIn actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly\nand definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although\neach event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.\n\nTo solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined\nand what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the\nphilosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that\ntaken by other sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions\nof freedom and inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the\nphenomena of life under those definitions, history should deduce a\ndefinition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves\nfrom the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and\nthat always appear dependent on these two elements.\n\nWhatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an\nindividual we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly\nof man\'s free will and partly of the law of inevitability.\n\nWhether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the\nincursions of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of\nsomeone\'s action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of\nseveral for his walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The\ndegree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these\npeople is clearly defined for us.\n\nOur conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to\ndifferences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but\nevery human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom\nand inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure\nof freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more\nfreedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive,\nand the more inevitability the less freedom.\n\nThe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases\naccording to the point of view from which the action is regarded,\nbut their relation is always one of inverse proportion.\n\nA sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry\nmother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man\ntrained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a\ndefenseless man--seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject\nto the law of necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which\nthese people were placed, and more free to one who does not know\nthat the man was himself drowning, that the mother was hungry, that\nthe soldier was in the ranks, and so on. Similarly a man who committed\na murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly\nin society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of\ninevitability, to someone who considers his action after twenty\nyears have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was\ncommitted. And in the same way every action of an insane, intoxicated,\nor highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who\nknows the mental condition of him who committed the action, and\nseems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it. In\nall these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished\nand the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or\nincreased, according to the point of view from which the action is\nregarded. So that the greater the conception of necessity the\nsmaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.\n\nReligion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,\nand history itself understand alike this relation between necessity\nand freedom.\n\nAll cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and\nnecessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:\n\n(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the\ndeeds.\n\n(2) His relation to time.\n\n(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.\n\nThe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the\nman\'s relation to the external world and the greater or lesser\nclearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by\nthe man in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what\nmakes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject\nto necessity than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the\nactions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly\npopulated district, or of one bound by family, official, or business\nduties, seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than\nthose of a man living in solitude and seclusion.\n\nIf we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything\naround him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his\nrelation to anything around him, if we see his connection with\nanything whatever--with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads,\nthe work on which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or\nthe light that falls on the things about him--we see that each of\nthese circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some\nside of his activity. And the more we perceive of these influences the\nmore our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our\nconception of the necessity that weighs on him increases.\n\nThe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation\nof the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the\nplace the man\'s action occupies in time. That is the ground which\nmakes the fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the\nhuman race, appear evidently less free than a man\'s entry into\nmarriage today. It is the reason why the life and activity of people\nwho lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot\nseem to me as free as the life of a contemporary, the consequences\nof which are still unknown to me.\n\nThe degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends\nin this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the\nperformance of the action and our judgment of it.\n\nIf I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same\ncircumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me\nundoubtedly free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then\nbeing in different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if\nthat act had not been committed much that resulted from it--good,\nagreeable, and even essential--would not have taken place. If I\nreflect on an action still more remote, ten years ago or more, then\nthe consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it\nhard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been\nperformed. The farther I go back in memory, or what is the same thing\nthe farther I go forward in my judgment, the more doubtful becomes my\nbelief in the freedom of my action.\n\nIn history we find a very similar progress of conviction\nconcerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of\nhumanity. A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing\nof all the known participants, but with a more remote event we already\nsee its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else\npossible. And the farther we go back in examining events the less\narbitrary do they appear.\n\nThe Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of\nthe crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still\nseem to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their\nheroes\' will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying\nits definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine\nthe modern history of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the\nCrusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain\npeople. In regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter\nanyone\'s head today to suppose that the renovation of the European\nworld depended on Attila\'s caprice. The farther back in history the\nobject of our observation lies, the more doubtful does the free will\nof those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law\nof inevitability.\n\nThe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that\nendless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which\neach phenomenon comprehended, and therefore man\'s every action, must\nhave its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a\ncause of what will follow.\n\nThe better we are acquainted with the physiological,\npsychological, and historical laws deduced by observation and by which\nman is controlled, and the more correctly we perceive the\nphysiological, psychological, and historical causes of the action, and\nthe simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the\ncharacter and mind of the man in question, the more subject to\ninevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others\nappear.\n\nWhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a\ncrime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we\nascribe a greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we\nmost urgently demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of\na virtuous act we rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case\nwe recognize in it more individuality, originality, and\nindependence. But if even one of the innumerable causes of the act\nis known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are\nless insistent on punishment for the crime, or the acknowledgment of\nthe merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom of the apparently\noriginal action. That a criminal was reared among male factors\nmitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father or\nmother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more\ncomprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems\nless deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The\nfounder of a sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when\nwe know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity. If we\nhave a large range of examples, if our observation is constantly\ndirected to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people\'s\nactions, their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less\nfree the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes. If\nwe examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under\nobservation, our conception of their inevitability would be still\ngreater. The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father, the\nmisconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company, a drunkard\'s\nrelapse into drunkenness, and so on are actions that seem to us less\nfree the better we understand their cause. If the man whose actions we\nare considering is on a very low stage of mental development, like a\nchild, a madman, or a simpleton--then, knowing the causes of the act\nand the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question, we\nsee so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as\nsoon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the\nresult.\n\nOn these three considerations alone is based the conception of\nirresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted\nby all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less\naccording to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in\nwhich the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according\nto the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of\nthe action and its investigation, and according to the greater or\nlesser understanding of the causes that led to the action.');

If we examine a man little dependent on\nexternal conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the\ncauses of whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of\na minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom.\n\nIn neither case--however we may change our point of view, however\nplain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the\nexternal world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or\nshort the period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the\ncauses of the action may be--can we ever conceive either complete\nfreedom or complete necessity.\n\n(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the\ninfluence of the external world, we never get a conception of\nfreedom in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what\nsurrounds him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My\naction seems to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my\narm in every direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in\nwhich there was least obstruction to that action either from things\naround me or from the construction of my own body. I chose one out\nof all the possible directions because in it there were fewest\nobstacles. For my action to be free it was necessary that it should\nencounter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being free we must\nimagine him outside space, which is evidently impossible.\n\n(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time\nof the deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I\nexamine an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it\nas not being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which\nit was committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself:\ncould I have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has\nalready passed? To convince myself of this I do not lift it the next\nmoment. But I am not now abstaining from doing so at the first\nmoment when I asked the question. Time has gone by which I could not\ndetain, the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now\nrefrain from lifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it the same\nthat now surrounds me. The moment in which the first movement was made\nis irrevocable, and at that moment I could make only one movement, and\nwhatever movement I made would be the only one. That I did not lift my\narm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from\nlifting it then. And since I could make only one movement at that\nsingle moment of time, it could not have been any other. To imagine it\nas free, it is necessary to imagine it in the present, on the boundary\nbetween the past and the future--that is, outside time, which is\nimpossible.\n\n(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be\nincreased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,\nan absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of\nthe expression of will in any action, our own or another\'s, the\nfirst demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause,\nfor without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to\nperform an action independently of any cause, but my wish to perform\nan action without a cause is the cause of my action.\n\nBut even if--imagining a man quite exempt from all influences,\nexamining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any\ncause--we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of\ninevitability as equaled zero, we should even then not have arrived at\nthe conception of complete freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by\nthe external world, standing outside of time and independent of cause,\nis no longer a man.\n\nIn the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite\ndevoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.\n\n(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space\nin which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for\nthe number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of\nspace. And therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men\nare defined, there is no complete inevitability but a certain\nmeasure of freedom remains.\n\n(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action\nwe are examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite,\nwhile time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never\nbe absolute inevitability.\n\n(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any\naction, we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and\nso again we never reach absolute inevitability.\n\nBut besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of\nfreedom to equal zero, we assumed in some given case--as for\ninstance in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot--complete\nabsence of freedom, by so doing we should destroy the very\nconception of man in the case we are examining, for as soon as there\nis no freedom there is also no man. And so the conception of the\naction of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any\nelement of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a\nman\'s completely free action.\n\nAnd so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of\ninevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of\nan infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of\ntime, and an infinite series of causes.\n\nTo imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of\ninevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond\ntime, and free from dependence on cause.\n\nIn the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom we\nshould have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of\ninevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.\n\nIn the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability\nwe should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time,\nand cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and\nunlimited would be nothing, or mere content without form.\n\nWe should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man\'s\nwhole outlook on the universe is constructed--the incomprehensible\nessence of life, and the laws defining that essence.\n\nReason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it\nvisibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time\nis infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable\notherwise. (3) The connection between cause and effect has no\nbeginning and can have no end.\n\nConsciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,\nconsequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the\nfixed moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as\nliving, consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I\nfeel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.\n\nReason gives expression to the laws of inevitability.\nConsciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom.\n\nFreedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man\'s\nconsciousness. Inevitability without content is man\'s reason in its\nthree forms.\n\nFreedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines.\nFreedom is the content. Inevitability is the form.\n\nOnly by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one\nanother as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and\nseparately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.\n\nOnly by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man\'s life.\n\nApart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define\none another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.\n\nAll that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation\nof free will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws\nof reason.\n\nAll that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain\nrelation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence\nof life to the laws of reason.\n\nThe great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious\nof them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity,\nanimal force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life\nin man and we call that freedom.\n\nBut just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but\nfelt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which\nwe know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the\nfirst knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton\'s law), so\ntoo the force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which\neveryone is conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know\nthe laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that\nevery man dies, up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and\nhistoric laws).\n\nAll knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the\nlaws of reason.\n\nMan\'s free will differs from every other force in that man is\ndirectly conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way\ndiffers from any other force. The forces of gravitation,\nelectricity, or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one\nanother in that they are differently defined by reason. Just so the\nforce of man\'s free will is distinguished by reason from the other\nforces of nature only by the definition reason gives it. Freedom,\napart from necessity, that is, apart from the laws of reason that\ndefine it, differs in no way from gravitation, or heat, or the force\nthat makes things grow; for reason, it is only a momentary undefinable\nsensation of life.\n\nAnd as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly\nbodies, the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity,\nor of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of\nastronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the\nsame way does the force of free will form the content of history.\nBut just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of\nthis unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the\nsubject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free\nwill in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause\nforms the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of\nmetaphysics.\n\nIn the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of\ninevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital\nforce is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above\nwhat we know of the essence of life.\n\nSo also in history what is known to us we call laws of\ninevitability, what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for\nhistory only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know\nabout the laws of human life.');

If there is even a single body\nmoving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no\nconception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists.\nIf any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical\nlaw can exist, nor any conception of historical events.\n\nFor history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end\nof which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a\nconsciousness of man\'s will in the present moves in space, time, and\ndependence on cause.\n\nThe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the\nmore evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define\nthose laws is the problem of history.\n\nFrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards\nits subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events\nin man\'s freewill, a scientific enunciation of those laws is\nimpossible, for however man\'s free will may be restricted, as soon\nas we recognize it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law\nbecomes impossible.\n\nOnly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal,\nthat is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we\nconvince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes,\nand then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of\nlaws as its problem.\n\nThe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of\nthought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously\nwith the self-destruction toward which--ever dissecting and dissecting\nthe causes of phenomena--the old method of history is moving.\n\nAll human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at\ninfinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons\nthe process of analysis and enters on the new process of the\nintegration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the\nconception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property\ncommon to all unknown, infinitely small, elements.\n\nIn another form but along the same path of reflection the other\nsciences have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity\nhe did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction;\nhe said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the\nproperty of attracting one another, that is, leaving aside the\nquestion of the cause of the movement of the bodies, he expressed\nthe property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the\ninfinitely small. The same is done by the natural sciences: leaving\naside the question of cause, they seek for laws. History stands on the\nsame path. And if history has for its object the study of the movement\nof the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in\nthe lives of individuals, it too, setting aside the conception of\ncause, should seek the laws common to all the inseparably\ninterconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.');

By disproving that law it might have been possible to retain\nthe old conception of the movements of the bodies, but without\ndisproving it, it would seem impossible to continue studying the\nPtolemaic worlds. But even after the discovery of the law of\nCopernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time.\n\nFrom the time the first person said and proved that the number of\nbirths or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this\nor that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and\neconomic conditions, and that certain relations of population to\nsoil produce migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history\nhad been built were destroyed in their essence.\n\nBy refuting these new laws the former view of history might have\nbeen retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to\ncontinue studying historic events as the results of man\'s free will.\nFor if a certain mode of government was established or certain\nmigrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such\ngeographic, ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will\nof those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of\ngovernment or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as\nthe cause.\n\nAnd yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with\nthe laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative\nphilology, and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.\n\nThe struggle between the old views and the new was long and\nstubbornly fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on\nguard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation.\nBut when truth conquered, theology established itself just as firmly\non the new foundation.\n\nJust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding\nbetween the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the\nsame way stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of\nsubverting revelation.\n\nIn the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes\npassion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret\nfor the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the\nother is the passion for destruction.\n\nTo the men who fought against the rising truths of physical\nphilosophy, it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would\ndestroy faith in God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the\nmiracle of Joshua the son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of\nCopernicus and Newton, to Voltaire for example, it seemed that the\nlaws of astronomy destroyed religion, and he utilized the law of\ngravitation as a weapon against religion.\n\nJust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of\ninevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and\nevil, and all the institutions of state and church that have been\nbuilt up on those conceptions.\n\nSo too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of\ninevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion,\nthough the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus\nin astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation\non which the institutions of state and church are erected.\n\nAs in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of\nhistory now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the\nrecognition or nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the\nmeasure of visible phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability\nof the earth, in history it is the independence of personality--free\nwill.\n\nAs with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the\nearth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth\'s\nfixity and of the motion of the planets, so in history the\ndifficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of\nspace, time, and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the\nindependence of one\'s own personality. But as in astronomy the new\nview said: \"It is true that we do not feel the movement of the\nearth, but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity, while\nby admitting its motion (which we do not feel) we arrive at laws,\"\nso also in history the new view says: \"It is true that we are not\nconscious of our dependence, but by admitting our free will we\narrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on the external\nworld, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.\"\n\nIn the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness\nof an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did\nnot feel; in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce\na freedom that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of\nwhich we are not conscious.');
